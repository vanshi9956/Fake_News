 JK Rowling Is Absolutely Destroying Piers Morgan For Being A Sniveling Trump Groveler (TWEETS),"Washed up television personality Piers Morgan has had a rough 24 hours.Appearing on Bill Maher s Real Time, the Trump supporting former celebrity tried to defend Trump s Muslim ban and justify  giving Trump a chance.  The rest of the panel was not interested in appeasing Trump s bigotry. Most notably, Morgan got publicly humiliated by Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, who flatly told Morgan to take his defense of Trump and  f*ck off. It was beautiful.Here s the video:But Morgan s nightmare 24 hours were just beginning. Unable to let it go, Morgan immediately spent the next 12 hours screaming that he wasn t owned on Twitter. As you might suspect, yelling  I m not owned!  for half a day on social media almost assuredly means you were, in fact, owned.Enter J.K. Rowling, who took the opportunity to further slay Morgan   kicking off a whole new series of meltdowns from Piers.Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I'd always imagined. https://t.co/4FII8sYmIt  J.K.

Piers.Piers responded to Rowling s brutal takedown by saying he s never paid attention to Harry Potter (an obvious lie, considering he wrote an entire article about it). Rowling wasn t impressed.Because you had a premonition that one day the author would roar with laughter at seeing you called out for your bullshit on live TV? https://t.co/8rkKSqJTnG  J.K.

WHY DEMOCRATS KEEP LOSING: Rep. Hakeem Jeffries Calls Trump Voters “White Supremacists” [Video],"Hakeem Jeffries just exposed his Trump Derangement on the House floor. His hate for President Trump is so offensive and inappropriate. He s the definition of a JACKA$$:  We re wondering why were so many people who worship at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trump s campaign?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIakbhiZGgwHow racist and wrong of this man who says Trump voters are  dripping in hatred Unreal!During a speech on the House floor on Monday, Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) argued that while not all Trump voters are racists,  every racist in America voted for Donald Trump. Jeffries said,  Since January 20th, we ve seen a disturbing increase here in America in anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-black, anti-LGBT and anti-Semitic acts. And the question is, is this just a coincidence, or could it possibly have something to do with the election of the 45th president of the United States of America? Now, in part, what we re seeing is connected to a historic backlash that has often occurred throughout this journey that we ve been on here in America, that whenever we make significant progress, there s always a backlash amongst some in America who ve got a problem with the fact that we ve done things designed to be more consistent with our values of liberty and justice for all, equal protection under the law. After listing historical examples of this, Jeffries stated,   And then, of course, we ve got Barack Obama, who was elected in what many of us viewed as an incredible step in the right direction, African-Americans having gone from the outhouse to the White House. Eight years of tremendous progress in moving this country forward, followed by the election of Donald Trump, a man who spent five years perpetrating the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America. And many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worship at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trump s campaign? What was it about this individual that so many folks dripping in hatred flocked to his candidacy? That s not to say that every American who voted for Donald Trump is a racist. We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald Trump. that s a problem. He concluded,  And so, again, I just ask the question in closing, is this all a big coincidence? We know part of it is the backlash that has often occurred whenever we ve made progress in America, but this president has a responsibility to address the rise in hate crimes that have taken place on his watch, whether or not his election is directly connected to it.

ISLAMIC JUSTICE: Britain Is Stunned When They Discover How Many Secret Sharia Courts Are Operating In UK,"Like dominoes, the Hijra keeps marching across Europe, destroying the distinct cultures of one country after another. Sweden and the UK are in big trouble France is next and thanks to bleeding heart liberal Democrats in America, the U.S. isn t be far behind At least 85 Islamic sharia courts are operating in Britain, a study claimed yesterday.The astonishing figure is 17 times higher than previously accepted.The tribunals, working mainly from mosques, settle financial and family disputes according to religious principles. They lay down judgments which can be given full legal status if approved in national law courts.However, they operate behind doors that are closed to independent observers and their decisions are likely to be unfair to women and backed by intimidation, a report by independent think-tank Civitas said.Commentators on the influence of sharia law often count only the five courts in London, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham and Nuneaton that are run by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, a body whose rulings are enforced through the state courts under the 1996 Arbitration Act.But the study by academic and Islamic specialist Denis MacEoin estimates there are at least 85 working tribunals.The spread of sharia law has become increasingly controversial since its role was backed last year by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice who stepped down last October.Dr Williams said a recognised role for sharia law seemed  unavoidable  and Lord Phillips said there was no reason why decisions made on sharia principles should not be recognised by the national courts.But the Civitas report said the principles on which sharia courts work are indicated by the fatwas   religious decrees   set out on websites run by British mosques.Mr MacEoin said:  Among the rulings we find some that advise illegal actions and others that transgress human rights standards as applied by British courts. Examples set out in his study include a ruling that no Muslim woman may marry a non-Muslim man unless he converts to Islam and that any children of a woman who does should be taken from her until she marries a Muslim.Further rulings, according to the report, approve polygamous marriage and enforce a woman s duty to have sex with her husband on his demand.The report added:  The fact that so many sharia rulings in Britain relate to cases concerning divorce and custody of children is of particular concern, as women are not equal in sharia law, and sharia contains no specific commitment to the best interests of the child that is fundamental to family law in the UK. Under sharia, a male child belongs to the father after the age of seven, regardless of circumstances. It said:  Sharia courts operating in Britain may be handing down rulings that are inappropriate to this country because they are linked to elements in Islamic law that are seriously out of step with trends in Western legislation. WATCH Muslims demand Shari Law in Britain:The Civitas study said the Islamic courts should no longer be recognised under British law.Its director Dr David Green said:  The reality is that for many Muslims, sharia courts are in practice part of an institutionalised atmosphere of intimidation, backed by the ultimate sanction of a death threat. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said:  Everyone should be deeply concerned about the extent of these courts. They do entrench division in society, and do nothing to entrench integration or community cohesion. It leads to a segregated society. There should be one law, and that should be British law. We can t have a situation where people can choose which system of law they follow and which they do not. We can t have a situation where people choose the system of law which they feel gives them the best outcome. Everyone should equal under one law.

 President Obama Hilariously Skewers Trump’s Hateful Rhetoric In Thunderous Speech (VIDEO),"President Obama took aim at Donald Trump and his violent racist rhetoric on Saturday, and it makes us wish he could run for a third term. America is pretty darn great right now,  Obama thundered in Dallas in a direct rebuke of Trump s campaign claim that American has somehow gotten worse over the last eight years. America is making strides right now! America is better off than it was right now! The American people should be proud of what we have achieved together in the last eight years since the recession hit. We are great right now. Obama then went after Trump and the other GOP candidates for turning the election into a childish circus where lies reign over facts and violence against other Americans is encouraged, something that has led to multiple clashes between Trump supporters and protesters. What the folks who are running for office should be focused on is how we can make it even better   not insults and schoolyard taunts and manufacturing facts, not divisiveness along the lines of race and faith. Certainly not violence against other Americans or excluding them. We re a better country than that. Here s the video via YouTube.But President Obama was not done yet. As the crowd laughed, Obama turned Trump and his multiple business scams into a punchline. Imagine what Trump would say if he actually had a record like this instead of selling steaks,  Obama quipped. Has anybody bought that wine?  Obama asked the audience.  I want to know what that wine tastes like. I mean, come on, you know that s like some $5 wine. They slap a label on it, they charge you $50, saying this is the greatest wine ever. Come on! And then President Obama lambasted Republicans for saying how shocked they are over Trump s racist rhetoric, reminding them that their front-runner is the same guy who would not drop his obsession with Obama s birth certificate. Republicans didn t say anything then, Obama pointed out, because Trump s rhetoric was not aimed at the GOP like it is now.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, the Republican Party and Fox News built the monster that is now taking over the party and invited white supremacists to take a prominent seat next to him.Trump s status as front-runner should be the end of the Republican Party as a legitimate political organization, but it appears Trump is merely replacing it with a fascist organization that will be even worse. In their desperation to oppose President Obama at every turn using hate and fear to gin up opposition and extremism, Republicans created the atmosphere for someone like Trump to rise and thrive and now they are paying the price for it. And so is America. One wonders how long it will be before even Republicans wish that President Obama could stay in office for another four years.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 13, 2016"
College Punishes Success By Not Allowing Yacht Club At Prestigious School [VIDEO],"The shaming of the rich should not surprise anyone coming from a whacked out college that actually offers a major in the non-belief of God. The Left s attempt to redefine the core values and beliefs that make America the greatest country in the world offends us. California College Denies Student Yacht Club, Says Yacht Clubs Are OffensiveAre yacht clubs   in and of themselves   offensive? According to Pitzer College in Claremont, California, the answer is yes.Last week, the student Senate at Pitzer voted to deny instating a yacht club at the school  as the majority of Senators found the name  yacht club  to have a particularly offensive association with yacht clubs and a recreation known for being exclusive,  according to Taylor Novick-Finder, a Pitzer College Senator.This morning on  Fox and Friends,  Anna Kooiman welcomed Claremont Independent publisher Steven Glick to the program to discuss. I think the P.C. police have been going further and further every day with what they re deeming offensive,  said Glick, who is also a student at nearby Pamona College.  It s becoming increasingly trivial, concerning what should be censored or banned. It s unfortunately not a surprise to see,  he added.Via: FOX News ",politics,"Oct 11, 2015"
" Conservatives Bashed Obama For ‘Bowing’ To Saudis, Trump Just…Curtsied??? (VIDEO)","Long before presidential scandals were as serious as conflicts of interest and obstruction of justice, conservatives had to content themselves with bashing President Obama over every small thing   however silly. Naturally, those criticisms have come back to haunt them as their own new president s bull in a china shop approach to governance means he does every single thing conservatives once accused Obama of doing but worse.It s exposed the conservative media as a clown car overflowing with hypocrites. Before FBI investigations and Russian collusion, this is the sort of thing conservative reporters spent weeks endlessly covering:Even nearly a decade later, the comment section on sites like Breitbart and InfoWars feature commenters who love to attack President Obama for this supposed  bow.  Ironically, the fact that they can t think up anything better to criticize him for inadvertently highlights how relatively scandal-free Obama s presidency was.That hasn t stopped Fox News. The network seemed eager to smear Obama during its coverage of Trump s visit to the Middle East. In an hilariously half-baked  report  on  foreign policy, Fox ran with this headline early into Trump s Saudi Arabian visit. Ugh.That headline becomes extremely awkward when the latest video from Trump s visit emerged: The man conservatives say is an alpha male leader gave a small curtsy after he was presented with a medal in Saudi Arabia.Unlike Obama, tRump didn't bow, he curtsied. ??? pic.twitter.com/TH50aJlGW6  BluePixie (@BluePixie3) May 20, 2017What a bold presidential gesture! I m sure Fox News will cover it with just as much seriousness as they had Obama s trip to Saudi Arabia, right?Here s another angle.

Giving Trump a medal or praising him are extremely easy ways to get him to do what you want. In Saudi Arabia s case, the small gold token seems to have been enough to compel Trump to rubber-stamp a $110 billion arms deal (including weapons Obama had withheld from the Saudis for fear they would be used in war crimes) and an additional $200+ billion investment deal.And Trump got to get a shiny medal!

TRUMP’S UN AMBASSADOR Nikki Haley Warns UN Members: “We’re Taking Names”,"New US Ambassador Nikki Haley strutted into the UN on Friday with a blunt message to American allies:  For those who don t have our backs, we re taking names. The former South Carolina governor made the remark to reporters as she arrived at the world body s headquarters in Manhattan to present her credentials to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Our goal with the administration is to show value at the UN and the way that we ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well,  she said. For those that don t have our back, we re taking names, we will make points to respond to that accordingly,  President Trump s envoy said.She said Trump wants her to put  fresh eyes  on the UN. Everything that s working, we re going to make it better,  she said.  Everything that s not working we re going to try to fix, and anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we re going to do away with. She then hopped on an elevator and went to the 38th floor to meet Guterres, who became UN chief on Jan. 1. They then went into his office for a private sit-down. There have been reports that the White House is poised to demand major cutbacks in UN agencies and personnel in slashing Washington s financial contributions to the organization.

 Top GOP Adviser Admits Hillary Clinton Would Be A ‘Better President’ Than Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Mitt Romney s top adviser in the 2012 election has just accepted what any reasonable Republican that cares about the future of America will have to come to terms with: Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be a better president than the current GOP front runner, Donald Trump.Stuart Stevens reluctantly admitted this on Tuesday during Bloomberg s With All Due Respect. The star strategist said: Personally, I think Hillary Clinton would be a better president than Donald Trump because I think that Donald Trump is a dangerous person and is someone who would embarrass America. Stevens added that this didn t necessarily mean that he supported Clinton, but that the prospect of backing Trump was something he couldn t possibly stomach. I have no desire to see Hillary Clinton as president of the United States. But if this is the choice   I will not give her my vote, but I can t support Donald Trump. We can t blame Stevens for not wanting to be part of the reason that America imploded. You can watch Stevens  interview below: Stevens has been bashing Trump for months, previously stating: I don t think he s going to be on the ballot by Feb. 1. The greatest sin in his value system is to be a loser, and most people who run for president lose. I don t think he ll risk it. Of course, Trump took to Twitter and gave it right back to him in his usual childlike manner:TwitterNo one thought Trump would make it this far, but he has and the more level-headed Republicans are scrambling to do whatever damage control they can. As Trump continues to look like a more likely candidate for the GOP nomination, Stevens is hardly the only Republican who is refusing to back Trump if he wins. On Tuesday, Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) emailed supporters and said that he would not be standing behind someone so lacking in the judgement, temperament and character needed to be our nation s commander-in-chief. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) even said he would back a third-party candidate instead of Trump.

 Watch Giddy Republican Congressman Confirm Voter ID Is Meant To Hurt Democrats (VIDEO),"A giddy Wisconsin Republican Congressman was perhaps still buzzing from Ted Cruz s victory in the state s primary when he accidentally let the cat out of the bag about his party s use of voter ID laws. Speaking with a reporter at Serb Hall, where Cruz delivered his victory speech, Rep. Glenn Grothman said he was very confident about his party s chances in November because they have voter ID laws as the ace up their sleeve.For those wondering why this is a big deal, please remember that Republicans have repeatedly tried to keep this obvious fact under the radar. Thanks to Grothman the bell has been rung. The genie is out of the bottle. Republicans are using racist and discriminatory laws of their own design to keep Democrats away from the polls as a pillar of their election strategy.When asked about a Republican nominee s chances in a general election, Grothman didn t hesitate to give credit where it was due: His party s efforts to make it harder to vote. Well, I think Hillary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever put up and now we have photo ID. I think photo ID is going to a little bit of a difference as well. This confirms what many political observers have been saying all along. The Republicans who push for stronger voter ID laws under the pretext to stop (nonexistent) voter fraud are using it as a cudgel to strongarm Democratic voters out of the voting booths. Given the fact that these laws almost invariably affect poor, often minority voters, this means two things: Democrats are being prevented for voting for the candidates who they would like to, and Republicans can continue to ignore the plight of the poor because they have been systematically disenfranchised.It s particularly unsurprising that a state run by a guy like Gov. Scott Walker (R) would have lawmakers actively salivating about disenfranchising people. His administration has never been one to dwell on actual democracy. A deeply unpopular governor, Walker managed to escape a strong impeachment effort by flooding his recall opposition campaign warchest with out-of-state dollars from conservative groups. It s Walker s administration which has been the most passionate about getting Voter ID laws in place: Their jobs literally depend on it.Thanks to Rep. Grothman, we know now without question that this is an intentional tactic used by a quickly disintegrating political party to cling onto power.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 6, 2016"
 Corinthian Colleges Must Pay Students More Than $1 Billion Dollars,"Corinthian Colleges must pay $1.2 billion dollars to students. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow determined that Corinthian Colleges is guilty of misleading students with false advertising. ProPublica published an excellent report on how Corinthian Colleges used predatory tactics to target homeless people and other marginalized communities for recruitment. Once students enrolled at one of the 91 campuses that made up Corinthian Colleges, they almost always ended up incurring a huge amount of debt that they could never pay back.Given that Corinthian Colleges filed for bankruptcy in May with only $19.2 million dollars in assets, it seems highly unlikely that students defrauded by the for-profit college will ever see a payout from the lawsuit.However, students who were defrauded by Corinthian Colleges will get some type of relief. The Department of Education announced on Friday that students will be given a way to have any debt they incurred while attending a Corinthian college forgiven. When Americans invest their time, money and effort to gain new skills, they have a right to expect they ll get an education that leads to a better life for them and their families. Corinthian was more worried about profits than about students  lives,  U.S. Education Secretary John B. King Jr. said in a statement.Despite the fact that students will not receive any money from the lawsuit, that does not mean that this isn t very good news. MarketWatch reports:The judgment could help students in another way, said Ben Miller, the senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. It could serve as evidence of Corinthian s wrongdoings for former students who are applying to the federal government to have their loans forgiven because they believe the school violated state law, he said.  It would seem like if there are programs within California that didn t have sufficient evidence for borrower discharge yet, I would think this judgment gives what s necessary,  he said.Overall this is really good news   though it does not really feel like justice truly has been served. No one should have to be given a debt sentence simply for wanting to receive a higher education. Criminal enterprises such as Corinthian Colleges would not have a market to exploit for profit if we had a tuition-free higher education system in the United States.

BREAKING: TRUMP PICKS PENCE FOR VP…Why This Could Be YUGE For Conservatives,"This could be YUGE news for conservatives who were on the fence about Trump..Gov. Mike Pence is dropping his re-election bid in Indiana to become Donald Trump s running mate.IndyStar has confirmed that Trump plans to announce Pence as his selection for vice president, ending a weeks-long vice presidential casting call during which Trump vetted a handful of high-profile Republicans.Trump s national campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said  a decision has not been made.  A formal announcement is scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday in Manhattan.The long-awaited decision upends the political landscape in Indiana and at least partially remakes the Trump campaign in Pence s image.In Pence, Trump has added a social conservative who GOP strategists say will reassure rank-and-file Republicans that Trump can be trusted to pursue their interests. Veteran political observers say Pence, a former U.S. House member and chairman of the House Republican Conference, will provide a disciplined counter to Trump s improvisational campaign style. Pence also brings fundraising power and credibility on a wide range of policy issues that are important to conservatives. How Governor Mike Pence will help Trump:Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would bring constitutional fidelity, conservative credentials, traditional faith, foreign policy, Washington know-how, and a calm, steady, Midwestern demeanor to a national ticket with Donald Trump, boosting the New York businessman with several types of voters that may prove to be the key to building an electoral coalition that could propel Trump into the White House.Pence was an Indiana talk show host who took on the party establishment to get into Congress. Once there, he was regularly a thorn in the establishment s side, routinely opposing the go-along-to-get-along establishment playbook. But he did so as a  happy warrior  who kept disagreement focused on policies, while being friendly and personable with his opponents.Over time, Pence became very popular among conservatives, and effective at communicating a conservative message through the national media.Pence repeatedly opposed George W. Bush s proposals to expand government. When Republicans lost the U.S. House in 2006, Pence took the ultimate anti-establishment step of running against John Boehner to be the leader of House Republicans. He lost that bid, but garners almost 30 voters against the future Speaker, making a name for himself as someone willing to oppose anyone who Pence believed would not lead as a conservative.Pence was regarded as an effective legislator under both Republican and Democratic presidents. Trump has no experience negotiating with Congress or experience with the vast complexity of the federal government. Pence could remedy all that.Pence is also an evangelical Christian with a model family.For a much more in-depth look at Governor Mike Pence and what he brings to a Trump ticket: BreitbartPence is set to officially become the vice presidential nominee during the Republican National Convention, which starts July 18 in Cleveland. He could become the first vice president from Indiana since Dan Quayle took office in 1989 under George H.W. Bush.Pence s departure for national politics sets up a scramble among Indiana Republicans to determine who will replace Pence to run against Democratic challenger John Gregg in the November gubernatorial election.

"Trump ‘Diversity Council’ Member Threatens to Quit If Trump Ends DACA…Bye, Bye!

Bye Bye!Trump diversity council member tells @Acosta he may quit the council if Trump moves ahead to end DACA https://t.co/CCn90EgSdn  CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 4, 2017 I want to remind him and his team that from an economic standpoint, and again, we re business people if you look at this from a purely economic standpoint again, none of these young people gets government benefits of any sorts so they re not costing us anything. They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP",left-news,"Sep 4, 2017"
 WATCH: Chuck Todd HUMILIATES Rudy Giuliani After He Pathetically Defends Trump,"Appearing on NBC s Meet The Press Sunday morning, Rudy Giuliani continued his efforts to defend Donald Trump. With Trump s campaign falling apart and the rest of the GOP quickly abandoning their presidential nominee, Giulini has continued to stump for Trump despite the fact that Trump is now being skewered by both Democrats and Republicans over his violently misogynistic remarks regarding groping women.It didn t take very long for the show s host Chuck Todd to show what it means to be a friend of Trump at the moment. Giuliani, who recently defended Trump s  grab her by the pussy  comment by saying that  The fact is men, at times, talk like that,  was forced to listen to audio recordings where Trump used vile misogynistic language. Because his cognitive dissonance apparently knows no limits, Giuliani offered another pathetic attempt to defend Trump. Still, he wasn t running for president,  Giulini says.Todd responds perfectly saying: Oh, he wasn t running for president so it s OK to be a misogynist. He wasn t running for president so it s OK to make unwanted sexual advances? That s a good counterpoint to have on hand for the rest of the election. Assuming Trump doesn t drop out of the race, his campaign is going to desperately try to position him as a reformed sinner, to appeal to moderate Christian right. A critical demographic of consistent voters Trump needs in toss-up states.At that point, Giuliani tried desperately to pivot to talking about recently leaked portions of transcripts from paid speeches that Hillary Clinton gave. Todd then asks Giulini an excellent question that proves that Giuliani had just bit himself on the ass with that pivot attempt. If you believe that Hillary Clinton says one thing in private and that means what she really is, is what she is in private, should we assume what Donald Trump did   is really what Donald Trump is like in private? That s what you re implying here with Hillary Clinton.

However, there s more to it.The full message reads:  Black lives matter. So let s quit killing each other.  It s a statement directed against black-on-black crime.Normally, liberals take umbrage at the idea that somebody might evaluate problems caused within the black community by other blacks because it doesn t suit the narrative.

Why Donald J.

Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fightsHE FIGHTSMy Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I m not bothered by Donald Trump s lack of decorum. They ask if I don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office.  Here s my answer:We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as John McCain? We tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same.This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.I don t find anything  dignified,   collegial  or  proper  about Barack Obama s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don t see anything  statesman-like  in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified,   collegial  or  proper. The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the  60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take-over of the universities   till today.The problem is, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality and propriety.With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America s first wartime president in the Culture War.During wartime, things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that,  I cannot spare this man. He fights. General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.Trump is fighting. And what s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel s, he s shouting,  You magnificent bastards, I read your book!  That is just the icing on the cake, but it s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he s defeating the Left using their own tactics.That book is Saul Alinsky s Rules for Radicals   a book so essential to the Liberals  war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.Trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri   Trump has isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all. Everyone gets that it s not just CNN   in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than CNN s   CNN is just a piker.Most importantly, Trump s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices.They can either  go high  (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery.The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright s, church.Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration s cover-up. This makes  going high  a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than Nixon. This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before, and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media.And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case  l ) libel laws protecting the media, they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly.Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their  deal  with him public.Instead, CNN   playing by  Chicago Rules    was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fights.Townhall published this brilliant article on July 13, 2017.

 North Carolina Republican Throws Temper Tantrum Over Bruce Springsteen Cancelling Concert,"In retaliation of Bruce Springsteen cancelling a concert over the state s anti-LGBT law, a North Carolina Republican whined and stated that he might have to become a Justin Bieber fan now.North Carolina Republicans jammed House Bill 2 into law last month in response to a Charlotte city ordinance that protected LGBT people from discrimination. But the new law overturns the ordinance, barring cities and counties from passing their own anti-discrimination laws.In addition, the law also prevents cities and counties from raising the minimum wage, allows employers to fire workers for any reason, and outlaws transgender people from using the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. Basically, the four-page law makes North Carolina a crappier place to live.As predicted, businesses are not happy about this law and it s already hurting the state as Paypal has cancelled a project in the state that would have created hundreds of jobs. And most prominently, Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert in Greensboro rather than perform in a state that discriminates against their own citizens. To my mind, it s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress,  the legendary rocker wrote in a statement condemning the law.  Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry   which is happening as I write   is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards. And in response, North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Walker, who is also a pastor, threw a tantrum over the cancellation in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.Claiming that the law is merely meant to catch  imposters  who would somehow take advantage of laws protecting transgender people, Walker called Springsteen a  bully. Bruce is known to be on the radical left,  Walker whined.  He s got every right to be so, but I consider this a bully tactic. It s like when a kid gets upset and says he s going to take his ball and go home. Walker then pointed out upcoming concerts that are coming to the state. We ve got other artists coming soon   Def Leppard, Justin Bieber,  Walker said. I ve never been a Bieber fan, but I might have to go. Maybe artists who weren t  born to run  deserve a little bit more support. Yeah, and now that you ve professed your support of these artists, they should probably consider running as far away from the bigoted state of North Carolina as possible. Because the last thing Def Leppard and Justin Bieber would want is to be endorsed by a Republican who supports discriminating against people, especially since many of those people are their fans.Walker and his fellow Republicans are the real bullies in North Carolina. This bill isn t about  imposters  at all. That s merely the excuse the GOP used to pass the law despite the fact that there have been zero instances of sex offenders using LGBT protection to defend predatory behavior across 17 states and over 200 cities.Make no mistake, Republicans brought these economic consequences upon their state themselves by legalizing discrimination when they could have followed Charlotte s lead and passed a similar law covering the entire state. Instead, they chose hate and took the state backwards.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"April 9, 2016"
 Marco Rubio NAILS IT: Trump As President Would Have ‘Life And Death Consequences’ (VIDEO),"Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been going after presidential rival Donald Trump with a vengeance over the past few weeks, continuously calling out the Republican front-runner in every way possible   from his lies to his spelling to his offensive and hateful rhetoric.On Friday, Rubio targeted Trump s anti-Muslim comments during an appearance on CNN s  New Day , stating that Trump needs to tone down the Islamophobia because the rhetoric a president puts forth has  life and death consequences.  Rubio, who pretty much has no hope for becoming the GOP nominee, spoke some truth when he said: I know people like it that Donald Trump says whatever he wants and whatever they feel like saying. Presidents cannot say anything they want. Presidents have to understand that their words have consequences, often life and death consequences, for real people in the real world. Because of Trump s inflammatory, foul remarks, Rubio said what any level-headed American instinctively knows: that Trump wouldn t be a  good commander-in-chief  if he can t work with America s armed service in its entirety   because many of those members are Muslims. Rubio posed this question: How are you going to face them as commander-in-chief, knowing you re going around saying all Muslims hate the United States? I don t think you re going to be able to be a good commander-in-chief. You can watch Rubio s criticism of the business mogul below:These statements from Rubio come just one day after Rubio slammed Trump during Thursday s Republican debate, stating that defending Muslims isn t about being politically correct  after Trump insisted that  Islam hates us. During the debate, Rubio made similar comments to his interview on CNN: I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says, because he says what people wish they could say. The problem is presidents can t just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. Stating that although there are dangers in the world in regards to radical Islam, it s wrong to generalize an entire religion. Rubio said: There is no doubt that radical Islam is a danger to the world. I can also tell you that if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world, you re going to see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. Rubio s right, whether you agree with him as a presidential candidate or not   and this goes way beyond Trump s feelings about the Islamic faith. He s demonstrated the same anger and insensitivity toward Hispanics, women and many other minority groups. Trump s inflammatory, hateful rhetoric has the power and influence to divide this nation instead of unify it. He s taken the most awful aspects of the Republican party and amplified them. Just by the way his rallies have transformed into fighting arenas, Trump has already demonstrated that he approves of violence and cares very little about peace and the well-being of Americans his bigotry doesn t support. He s dangerous behind comprehension, and his brand of ignorance threatens to destroy America.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"March 11, 2016"
 Trump Whines That Diverse ‘Hamilton’ Cast And Audience Opposed Bigoted Mike Pence With Insane Twitter Rant,"Donald Trump has a very thin skin. He has demonstrated this repeatedly; after all, he attacked the family of a fallen Muslim-American soldier for daring to criticize his disparaging comments about Muslims, and did the same to a beauty queen who had the guts to reveal how poorly he treated her when she was the reigning Miss Universe. He again did the same to a reporter with a disability by mocking him on national television via a rally, and has attacked countless other people who dared to speak out against him regarding negative experiences they have had by working with or for Trump. His latest target? The cast of the great Broadway musical Hamilton. Now, Trump has taken to Twitter to disparage the cast of the musical for the supposed  harassment  that his vice president-elect Mike Pence received when he decided to go to a showing of Hamilton in super liberal New York City. Pence, who has a long and disturbing record of anti-woman and anti-LGBTQ positions and legislation, was booed at the production, and Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr in the musical, made an impassioned plea to Pence to have an administration with Trump that includes everyone. Of course, Trump could not let this perceived slight go, so he took to Twitter to disparage the cast, creators, and Dixon s statement to Pence, saying:Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016It s called free speech, pal. You have a vice president-elect who is easily one of the most anti-LGBTQ political figures in the nation showing up at a New York City Broadway musical that has the most diverse cast imaginable, including a star who is openly gay and HIV-positive. What did you expect? Did you want the cast to kiss Pence s ass? Not happening. Pence is getting the same level of respect he has shown the LGBTQ community, which is absolutely none. Make no mistake   you re both getting exactly what you deserve. Get used to it   this will be your reception everywhere you go for the next four years, and it is definitely well deserved.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"November 19, 2016"
 WATCH: Eva Longoria Kicks Trump’s A** On Behalf Of Latinos Everywhere,"Donald Trump got his ass handed to him by a Texas treasure.While many, including myself, focused on Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Eva Longoria delivered a smackdown of Donald Trump we all missed.The actress, who is of Mexican-American heritage, took aim at the Republican nominee for his racist attacks against Latinos, particularly Mexicans, whom Trump called  rapists  and  criminals. Like many of you, this election is very personal to me,  Longoria said during her speech.  I m from a small town in South Texas and if you know your history, Texas used to be part of Mexico. Now, I m ninth generation American. My family never crossed a border, the border crossed us. According to PBS:The Longoria family s roots in Texas run back to a time before Texas even existed. Lorenzo Longoria, Eva s first ancestor to arrive in the New World, sailed from Spain in 1603. Through the generations, Lorenzo s descendants moved north to the modern US-Mexico border. In 1767, Pedro Longoria, Eva s 7th great-grandfather, received almost 4000 acres along the Rio Grande in a land grant from the King of Spain. This land stayed in the family for over a century, enduring even the influx of Anglo settlers in the aftermath of the Civil War.In short, Eva Longoria s family has been in America far longer than Donald Trump s. His grandfather Frederick Trump immigrated to this country in 1885. Longoria s family could have retreated south to stay in Mexico if they had wanted to do so. But they chose to stay in America and that is where their allegiance has stayed ever since.Speaking of Trump, Longoria dedicated the next part of her speech to ripping him a new one for insulting just about everyone. When Donald Trump calls us criminals and rapists, he s insulting American families. My father is not a criminal or rapist; in fact, he s a United States veteran. When Trump cruelly mocked a disabled reporter, he was also mocking my special-needs sister Lisa and many like her. When he said that a wife who works is a very dangerous thing, he not only insulted me, he insulted my mother who worked as a special-education teacher for 40 years and raised four children while being a wife. Here s the video via YouTube.That s right. Donald Trump characterizes a man who fought for this country as a  criminal  even though he himself dodged the draft during the Vietnam War. Pathetic.Has anyone else noticed that Donald Trump is getting his ass handed to him on a regular basis by a lot of strong women? Because if that trend continues it means he s going to have a seriously bad day on Election Day.Featured image via screenshot",News,"July 26, 2016"

NEW YORK TIMES Publishes Trump Tax Return From 20 Years Ago…TRUMP FIRES BACK!," In a lame effort to score political points for Hillary Clinton, the New York Times published a portion of Donald Trump s 1995 tax return. They re now promoting the idea that Trump  could have  not paid taxes for decades.  Could have  doesn t mean he did! Does anyone care that a man with a huge business empire might try and pay less taxes or work the tax system to his advantage? Isn t that what most people do and it s legal to do it! I would question Trump s sanity if he begged to pay more taxes! The front pages of the tax returns themselves are essentially a non-issue, representing the 1995 gross business loss incurred by candidate Donald Trump who operates a massive conglomeration of business entities.The anti-Trump political angle is easily identifiable within the extensive article use of:  could have ,  might be ,  may have , phrases used throughout the woven narrative. Journalistic  narratives  are rarely based on facts.The identified $916 million single year operating income loss is no different than current losses of Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and a host of other corporations and businesses.Actually, Donald Trump s 1995 loss is smaller than the operating loss the New York Times reported when it sold the Boston Globe in 2013 for a net loss of $1.03 billion.The Times purchased the Boston Globe in  93 for $1.1 billion and sold it in 2013 for $70 million, a loss of $1.03 billion.

 Trump’s Ghostwriter Issues DIRE Warning About His Dangerous Current Mental State (VIDEO),"Tony Schwartz is a man who knows Donald Trump well. He spent nearly two years glued to Trump s side as they wrote Trump s famous book, The Art of the Deal. During this time, Schwartz learned some very disturbing things about Trump s broken personality, and for this reason, felt deep remorse for helping to make Trump as famous as he is.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Schwartz tirelessly warned America that this man was dangerous, that he had no conscience, that he had no soul, that he would be gravely dangerous as president. Now that a Trump presidency has come to pass, and the Trump White House is mired in deep scandal, Schwartz is speaking out again, to warn the nation and world about Trump s dangerous mental state.Schwartz has written a piece in the Washington Post explaining Trump s recent behavior, who the man is, his current state of mind, and the impulsive and dangerous actions that are sure to come.On Wednesday evening, Schwartz appeared on CNN s Anderson Cooper 360. He told host Anderson Cooper of Trump s likely mental state regarding the series of blows and events relating to the incompetence of his administration, and especially the Trump/Russia collusion investigation: I think he s reacting from a survival place. He s in pure defensive mode. I think that he s being run by the part of his brain that s reactive and impulsive, not capable of reflection. The sense of siege that he feels because his sense of self-worth is so, so vulnerable that the series of things that have happened are overwhelming to him. In other words, right now, Trump is like a caged animal who is feeling attacked, and he is not thinking clearly at all. It s pure impulse and reaction. Trump is dangerously impulsive on a good day. There s no telling what he is capable of when he is feeling this attacked and aggrieved.These are dangerous times, America. The man who is supposedly leading us is desperate and unhinged. Hopefully, someone in a position to do something about him steps up, for the good of the nation and the world.Watch Tony Schwartz s remarks below:Co-author of  The Art of Deal  on Trump:  I think he s in a pretty significant meltdown  https://t.co/YZ32bCBsdM https://t.co/rpTGglpp5H  Anderson Cooper 360  (@AC360) May 18, 2017Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2017"
 Republican Senator Open To Voting For Hillary Clinton,"The Republican Party may be losing another supporter as GOP Senator Susan Collins of Maine won t rule out voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Collins, who is a moderate, reached that decision based on Donald Trump s comments regarding Judge Gonzalo Curiel. Calling his comments  an order of magnitude more serious  than anything else he s said so far on the campaign trail, Collins told reporters:This is a difficult choice, and it s one, like many of my colleagues, that I am struggling with. It s not like we have perfect candidates from whom to choose in this election   I worked very well with Hillary when she was my colleague in the Senate and when she was Secretary of State. But I do not anticipate voting for her this fall. I m not going to say never, because this has been such an unpredictable situation, to say the least.When pressed that her comment looks like she would be willing to back the Democratic nominee over the Republican, she responded:That is true. But I do want to qualify that by saying it is unlikely that I would choose to vote for the Democratic candidate.In Collins  own words, never say never. While most Republicans refusing to back Trump have almost all indicated they would never vote for Clinton, Collins becomes the first Hill Republican to leave the option on the table   for now.Collins told reporters just earlier this week that if Trump wants to earn her endorsement, he will have to  really have to change  his approach. She also called on he presumptive Republican nominee to own up to making a mistake and to apologize to Curiel.As Trump enters the general phase of his campaign, he certainly isn t off to a good start with those in his own party. Mark Kirk of Illinois has rescinded his support for Trump and Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have held off on endorsing.With Republican lawmakers so openly hostile towards Trump, it leaves people wondering just how many of these people are actually going to vote for him.Featured image via Alex Wong",News,"June 9, 2016"
"[VIDEO] IN ONE OF THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE WORLD, An Iraqi Archbishop Makes A Beautiful Music Video To Give Christian Refugees Hope","Refugee camps are overflowing with Christians and Yazidis who ve been persecuted and chased from their homes by ISIS. This beautiful video reminds the residents of these refugee camps to keep the faith and not to lose hope in God and their faith community A British electronica band has teamed up with the archbishop of Iraq to release a song sending a message of hope to persecuted Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities in the crosshairs of the Islamic State and raising awareness about their suffering and need for support.Ooberfuse, a duo based in Woolwich, London, recently released the video, titled  We Are One.  The video was shot in various refugee camps in Erbil and features children of all backgrounds who are living in squalor after the Islamic State forced them to flee their homelands. They are the fortunate who managed to survive the assault.As The Christian Post reports, the video  features very strong Christian overtones and reiterates the fact that although many of these refugees have lost their homes and lives they once knew in Iraq, they will never be without the love and hope of God.  It also features quotes from a number of officials explaining the suffering of not being able to return home.Archbishop Bashar Warda of Erbil begins the video by reciting the Lord s Prayer in Aramaic, the language in which Jesus is believed to have first recited it. Archbishop Warda expressed enthusiasm for the project in speaking with the Catholic Herald.  Sometimes you take hard measures, unfortunate measures to deal with and treat this cancer,  he added, referring to the Islamic State as the  cancer. Archbishop Warda has previously used the term for the terrorist group, though noting in remarks in April that sectarian violence based on religion is  not new,  though the Islamic State has taken it to a new scale of horror. He has called for Christians to try to remain in their native lands in Iraq and preserve the religion there, as he has seen the numbers of his diocese diminish rapidly.  We know that life in Iraq is not easy, especially when they live crammed into a room in a house or in a caravan and we have been left with nothing,  he stated, but hoped some would reconsider. I think this is the first time in history a leading Middle Eastern religious leader has embraced the forms of popular culture to advance the Christian message of love and hope,  said Ooberfuse singer and guitarist Hal St John, thanking the archbishop for joining their efforts.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"May 9, 2015"
" Here’s How Trump Is Going To F*CK Us Into WWIII, And It Doesn’t Actually Start In The Middle East","Has anybody ever wondered whether all these acts of war, including the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan, are just distractions from the growing Russia scandal? Considering the fact that he won t say whether he actually authorized the MOAB strike, it s not too far-fetched to wonder if this was to distract us from news that our intelligence community may have concrete information showing his campaign colluded with Russia during the election.But the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan may not be all. Trump is threatening North Korea, too, in a more direct way than saying,  See my giant penis bomb? You shouldn t mess with me. We already sent a strike force across the Pacific to intimidate Kim Jong Un, who s been shooting missiles into the Sea of Japan lately. North Korea is now talking about conducting a nuclear test within the next few days, and the Trump administration has threatened to hit them with Tomahawks if they do so.But that s not all   there may well be an attempt to get  boots on the ground  in North Korea as well:The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site.American heavy bombers are also positioned in Guam to attack North Korea should it be necessary, and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.The U.S. strike could include missiles and bombs, cyber and special operations on the ground.Because that s totally the way to cow a foreign power. North Korea has warned that if we launch a pre-emptive strike against them, they could launch a nuke at us. Hot air? Maybe. But it would be better for Trump to take it seriously than strut around with his penis peacock feathers on full display right up until they actually do it.If dropping the biggest non-nuclear bomb in our arsenal isn t enough to scare them, then nothing will be. If we launch missiles at North Korea in a pre-emptive strike for a nuclear test, we ve committed an act of war, and no matter how we justify it, we ve made ourselves a threat to the entire world by provoking a nuclear power.And North Korea may or may not retaliate directly against us. While they ve threatened to  hit the U.S. first,  with a nuke should we strike, they might decide to hit South Korea, or even Japan, in retaliation for such an attack. In fact, Japan is worried that North Korea could send missiles tipped with sarin gas warheads their way. Sarin gas is the gas that Assad used on his people last week.In other words, Trump s aggressive actions have consequences he doesn t seem to understand. He s a macho peacock strutting around trying to convince the world that he s a bad-ass with a giant penis military at his disposal. Our military is not a toy, and bombs are not a toy, and neither are signals of strength in the situations in which Trump is using them. He needs to go. He s the biggest threat to the world we ve seen in decades.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
BLACK LIVES MATTER ACTIVIST Obama Invited To White House Charged With PIMPING Teenage Girl…Blames Conservatives “Trolls”,"Just another upstanding citizen who s been invited to the White House by our Community Organizer In Chief Birds of a feather Who can forget when Obama s speech about  child safety  was interrupted by a rapper who was wearing an ankle bracelet for KIDNAPPING went off?And then there was the rapper Tef Poe, who met with Obama in  our White House to  strategize , who tweeted this threat:  Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go A Black Lives Matter activist who operates a social justice charity was arrested last month on charges of sex trafficking a 17-year-old girl.Charles Wade co-founded Operation Help or Hush in the aftermath of the August 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The group claims it helps raise funds for the needy and provide food and shelter for activists.But according to a police report obtained by TheDC, the 33-year-old Wade was raising money in more explicit ways.He was arrested on April 25 at a motel where he resided in College Park, Md. Police say he was using the motel room to pimp a 17-year-old girl.He s charged with seven counts, including felonies for human trafficking. The charges carry sentences of up to 25 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Wade posted $25,000 bond and left jail on April 27.Wade denied the allegations in an email to The Daily Caller. Formerly a stylist for Solange Knowles, the sister of Beyonce, Wade has been featured in numerous news articles about the Black Lives Matter movement. He was also invited by the White House earlier this week to a movie screening with other Black Lives Matter activists. Wade says he did not attend the function, which was on Tuesday.Last year, a team of Washington Post reporters, including Pulitzer Prize-winner Wesley Lowery, included Wade in a profile of Black Lives Matter activists who protested after the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson. According to the police report, an undercover officer with the vice intelligence unit responded to an ad on backpage.com, a website frequently used by sex traffickers and prostitutes. Holla at me. Quick stay specials tonight and tomorrow. Independent. Fun and sexy. Text me to set up an appointment???????  reads the ad, which listed the age of the poster as 23.The undercover detective contacted the poster to set up a meeting. The respondent informed him that the cost of services would be $100 for a half-hour and provided an address, which turned out to be a Howard Johnson Inn in College Park. A room number was also provided.When the undercover john arrived, a white female wearing only a towel answered the door and let him inside the room. After she attempted to initiate contact with the detective he informed her he was a police officer, and she ran out of the room. Members of the Vice Intelligence Unit described a male that was watching the Undercover Detective as he entered [room 412],  the report reads.Investigators reported that the teenager, who gave her age as 17, said that Wade was her  manager.  She called him  CJ. Wade, who used a passport to rent the Howard Johnson Inn room, was arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Police recovered three cell phones from him.The alleged victim told investigators that Wade knew she was a minor. She said that he told her he was not concerned about her age because  you only have 5 months left until you re 18 so I m not worried. She also told investigators that she provided all the money she was paid to Wade.In response to TheDC s request for comment, Wade claimed that a tenant at a temporary housing facility he was running as part of his charity  was involved in activities  that he did not know about. As this is a legal matter, I m not going into serious detail with you,  he said.He did claim, however, that he was unfairly arrested because he was  too trusting. Despite those claims, the police report suggests that there is evidence that Wade was the person who communicated with the undercover detective by text message.Wade issued a statement on Twitter after being contacted by TheDC in which he blamed conservative  trolls  for focusing on the case. He also said  I am confident that I will be cleared of the charges I am currently facing. I was forced to make this statement before I was ready to because of ongoing efforts by Twitter  trolls  to stop my work and the work of my organization,  he wrote. For the past two to three days,  trolls  have been actively baiting conservative news outlets to report on my arrest, amongst other vindictive things that they are actively working on. Wade also stated that the recent arrest is the second time he has been arrested after  helping someone else.  He did not provide details of the case, but a review of criminal databases shows he was charged with 3rd degree grand theft in Miami in January. Wade says he was not convicted in the case nor did he take a plea deal. Records show that the case was closed in February.Wade was also arrested in August 2014 in Travis County, Tex. and charged with making false statements.For entire story: Daily Caller ",politics,"May 19, 2016"
 Rep. Ted Lieu Issues Blistering Takedown Of Trump’s Illegal Missile Strike (VIDEO),"Anyone who knows anything about the separation of powers understands that a president cannot just unilaterally take military action. He needs approval from Congress to execute an act of war. However, since Donald Trump is president and he seems to think he is somehow above the law, he doesn t bother with silly little details like that. As a result, we got his launching of 59 Tomahawk missiles into a Syrian airfield. It turns out that quite a few people in Congress believe what Trump did to be potentially illegal. One such person is Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA).Rep. Lieu is one of Trump s harshest critics and perhaps his most prolific Twitter troll. When it came to Trump s military action in Syria, Lieu did not mince words. Speaking with MSNBC s Katy Tur, Lieu said: Clearly, the president can take limited actions that the Congress has authorized such as going against terrorists who were involved with 9/11 or in terms of Iraq when Congress authorized the use of force in 2002, but there s been no congressional authorization to launch fifty-nine cruise missiles at a country that has not attacked us. Donald Trump s action last night was unconstitutional. He should not do it again. Rep. Lieu then went on to explain his problems with the launch and the dangers of taking such drastic action with no authorization and no clear strategy, after being asked if he would have authorized this action if he had been given the opportunity to do so: I might have if he would have articulated a strategy, and that is one of my fundamental problems with what he did. There has been no coherent strategy from the Trump administration. Last week, they signaled they were okay with Assad even though he had previously killed hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and used chemical weapons. Last night, they attacked the Assad regime. We need to know what is the Trump administration thinking and what is their long-term strategy in Syria? Rep. Lieu is right. Trump s actions went against the Constitution. He cannot unilaterally make war. Further, he is clearly an erratic, impulsive man. Said erratic, impulsive man now has the power to destroy the world with one temper tantrum. Therefore, more than ever, it is absolutely imperative that Congress use its Article I powers to check and balance this dangerously unstable president.Watch Rep. Lieu s remarks below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 9, 2017"
BAM! HANNITY UNLOADS On Cruz Over Delegates [Audio],"Wow! Did Hannity go too far with Cruz or did he not go far enough?GOP presidential candidate Texas Senator Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and talk radio and Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity engaged in a testy exchange over the delegate process on Hannity s radio show on Tuesday.Hannity began the interview by asking,  I think the number one question on the minds of Republicans right now is what is going on with the delegates. For example, if you can explain to people that your campaign, that you have every right, within the rules, to talk to candidates, that are pledged on a first ballot, to candidate A or candidate C, you being candidate B. And that   tell us what that process is. Cruz answered that isn t what people are concerned about, and are instead concerned about policy issues and beating Democratic candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Cruz further stated that  the media loves to obsess about process. This process, and this whining from the Trump campaign is all silly. It s very, very simple  . https://youtu.be/En5jPy8SzjUHannity then cut in to say,  I m on social media, with millions of people. I have 550 radio stations. And I have the top-rated cable in my hour, all across the board. And I am telling you, that people are telling me, that they find this whole process confusing.  He further stated that this wasn t a  process question. It s an integrity of the election question. And everybody s asking me this question. So, I want   I m giving you an opportunity to explain it. Cruz responded,  Sean, the only people asking this question, are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.  Hannity again cut in to ask,  Senator, why do you this? Every single time you you ve got to stop. Every time I have you on the air, and I ask a legitimate question, you try to throw this in my face. I m getting sick of it. I ve had you on more than any other candidate, on radio and TV. So, if I ask you, Senator, a legitimate question to explain to the audience, why don t you just answer it? Cruz then said,  Sean, can I answer your question without being interrupted?  Cruz then talked about the results in Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Wyoming, all of which Cruz has won. He added,  Over 1.3 million people voted in those 5 states. We won all 5. All of this noise and complaining and whining has come from the Trump campaign, because they don t like the fact that they ve 5 elections in a row, that Republicans are uniting behind our campaign. So, they re screaming, on Drudge, and it s getting echoed, this notion of voterless election. It is nonsense. They are making it up. Over 1.3 million people voted. We won landslides in all 5. Cruz continued,  Now, there is a second component, beyond the elections, which is the individual delegates are elected by the people. Donald Trump s campaign does not know how to organize on the grassroots. And so, when the delegates are elected, conservative activists, real conservative activists show up, and they elect delegates, and we are winning those elections over and over and over again. The Donald Trump campaign doesn t know what they re doing. They don t show up. In Colorado, the Donald Trump team was handing out flyers asking their supporters to vote for a slate of delegates, they included Cruz delegates on their slate. They just   they didn t even know how type up a piece of paper without getting it wrong. In Washington state, when Washington state elected their delegates, three days before the election, the Donald Trump campaign, in a panic, realized Washington state was getting ready to elect their delegates. They sent out an emergency email to their Washington supporters, but they screwed up, and sent it to their Washington, DC supporters, instead of their Washington state supporters. I cannot help that the Donald Trump campaign does not seem capable of running a lemonade stand. Elections are won by voters and grassroots activists showing up and voting for the candidate they support. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Apr 20, 2016"

 Rabbi Michael Lerner DESTROYS Trump In Brilliant Speech At Ali Funeral (VIDEO),"When we lost boxing legend Mohammed Ali this week, we lost more than an athlete. We lost a humanitarian, a man who was a great example to people all over the world of what being a leader and an all around decent human being means. Therefore, it is only fitting that his public funeral be a place to remind everyone what this great man was about, and what we as people should   and should not   aspire to be. That is just what Rabbi Michael Lerner did in a speech that brought the house down at Ali s funeral on Friday.Lerner took to the stage and declared that he was there as a  representative of American Jews.  After that, he turned his attentions to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Without mentioning the orange buffoon by name, Lerner said: We will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down Muslims and blaming Muslims for a few people. We know what it s like to be demeaned. We know what it s like to have a few people who act against the highest vision of our tradition to then be identified as the value of the entire tradition. Of course, this was a clear reference to Trump s appalling call to ban Muslims from the United States. Lerner wasn t done yet, though. He went on to trumpet the praises of a Clinton victory in November, and also insisted that we need to make the world a more equal place for all. He continued: Tell the next president of the United States that she should seek a constitutional amendment to make all national and state elections funded by Congress and the state legislatures, and all other sources of money be banned   including money from corporations, from individuals. Make it all public funding. Tell her that the way to achieve homeland security is not for us to try new ways of domination. The strategy of domination of The world of  the other  to get security has been tried for the last 10,000 years and it doesn t work. The way to get security is for the United States to become known as the most generous and caring country in the world, not the most powerful. Well said, Rabbi Lerner.

 Male Republican Blames ‘Female Senators’ For GOP Failure To Pass Health Law,"A Texas Republican congressman blamed female Republicans for the GOP s cruel  health care  bill, which would be more aptly named  death care.  Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) suggested that if they were men, he would challenge them to a gunfight.To make matters worse, he singled out the female Republicans saying that it s absolutely repugnant  that the GOP-led Senate hasn t had the ability to repeal the health care law even though they ve had seven years to come up with a viable alternative.Farenthold called out the  female senators from the Northeast  in reference to Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (someone should point him to a map).On Friday, during a radio interview on a Corpus Christi station last Friday, Farenthold said he finds it  absolutely repugnant  that  the Senate does not have the courage to do some of the things that every Republican in the Senate promised to do. Some of the people that are opposed to this [repealing Obamacare] there are some female senators from the northeast,  Farenthold said.  If it was a guy from south Texas I might ask them to step outside and settle this Aaron Burr-style. In 1804, Aaron Burr famously shot and killed his political adversary, Alexander Hamilton, in a New Jersey duel.Here s the audio:Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to push through an Obamacare repeal bill without a replacement, thus making the markets chaotic while leaving millions uninsured. After a few months, the three Republican women announced that they could not support repealing Obamacare. Sen. Collins called the Obamacare repeal bill  unacceptable  because it would leave millions of Americans without insurance. I have deep concerns and am opposed to the Senate bill,   she said, then added that the bill would  make sweeping changes to the Medicaid program,  and  would take out of the Medicaid program more than $700 billion dollars. You don t take a safety net program that has been operating for more than 50 years and change it in fundamental ways without having a single hearing to evaluate its impact,  she said.Rep. Blake Farenthold really shouldn t challenge her to any kind of a fight. We re pretty sure he would lose.Image via Twitter. ",News,"July 24, 2017"

 Bill O’Reilly Plays Stump The Trump On Foreign Policy And Makes Him Look Like A Fool (VIDEO),"Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday night, only to be embarrassingly stumped by Bill O Reilly.O Reilly wanted to know if Trump plans on taking military action against Iran if he becomes president, and Trump totally demonstrated his lack of foreign policy knowledge by dodging the question and ranting about things he really doesn t understand. If you re elected president are you going to take military action against Iran?  O Reilly asked.  Are you going to do something to that country? Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia,  Trump replied with what seems to be a reference to Iranians attacking the Saudi Arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the Saudis recently committed on New Year s Day in which 47 were killed, including a Shiite cleric.  I would want to protect Saudi Arabia,  Trump claimed.  But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically Trump suggested that he might attack Iran if Saudi Arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get America involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the Middle East.O Reilly continued to press Trump for an answer, calling him out for dodging the question.Trump then went on a tirade against the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a disastrous deal that Iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that Iran will have a nuclear weapon  very soon. Clearly, Trump is not aware of the fact that Iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians, which is definitive proof that the Iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.The Iran nuclear deal stands as one of President Obama s greatest achievements, and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is nothing more than ISIS posing as a legitimate nation. They use Sharia law and behead so many people every year that ISIS leaders must be envious. The only reason our government has failed to call the Saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world.This is why it is not only important for the United States to reject military action in the Middle East, we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on Saudi Arabia for our energy needs. Frankly, the United States government should grow a pair and strongly condemn Saudi Arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization.The bottom line, however, is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief. He not only wants to send American troops to die needlessly in Iran, he wants to make Saudi Arabia pay for it. Basically, Trump would turn America into a puppet for the Saudis. But more likely, he would damage relations with both nations and put America squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into World War III.America does not need more war. We need peace. And as O Reilly pointed out, voters have the right to know what Trump plans to do, even if Trump thinks they have no right to know at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 6, 2016"

 Unhinged Ann Coulter Blames ‘Fat Girls’ For Trump Protests,"While this election was undeniably (from one side) meaner and more divisive than perhaps ever before, most elections do become mean and divisive, but the winning party usually calls for unity while the losing party licks its wounds.Non-Trump voting Americans are licking their wounds in their constitutionally (for now) protected way, by protesting. The media, of course, generally only reports on the worst of the protesters, while less attention has been paid to the rising violence and hate crimes from Trump supporters.Trump had this to say about the protests:Just had a very open and successful presidential election.

SICK REASON Historic City With “Off the charts” Crime Rates Passes Disgusting Ordinance Putting Criminals Before Cops,"The Providence (RI) City Council voted Thursday to give first passage to the Community Safety Act, a far-reaching ordinance designed to curb profiling by the city s police but the odd benefits it gives to criminals and specifically gang members has many in law enforcement shaking their head.The council voted 12-0 to approve the ordinance as hundreds of supporters cheered.  Mayor Jorge Elorza has already said he intends to sign it into law.After reading the details of this ordinance, the only ones that will be cheering in a few months will be the criminals.While the politicians covered up the terrible provisions in this act by saying that it was simply designed to  curb profiling,  what was really inside it will create one of the most lawless cities this country knows.The violent crime rate in Providence is already 134% higher  than the state average and the passing of this ordinance will be the best thing that Rhode Island criminals have seen in some time.Developed by activist groups, the Community Safety Act is weighed heavily towards giving benefits to the criminal element.  If you don t believe us, just look at the official logo (above) of the Act.  It shows the police at the bottom, which is exactly where the politicians have placed them by passing this ordinance.No one in law enforcement will argue that racial profiling should not be eliminated but this Act uses that premise to handcuff law enforcement from simply doing their job.The international and extremely violent gang MS-13 that initiated in El Salvador and contains a large number of illegal immigrants here in the United States, has been thriving in Providence, RI for several years. This new  Safety Act  will go a long way in helping this gang, that uses many of the same practices as ISIS to grow and prosper in Providence:Here are some of the items that the future victims of Providence Crime need to be aware of:And of course, the ordinance ends with an entire page on how police will be prosecuted and sued for any violation of anything in the ordinance of which must goes far and beyond any case law or practice that any agency in this country is currently doing.  Actually, the piles of paperwork that the Act requires of a police officer after they stop someone is done in another city .Chicago.  Hasn t that worked out well there?Now there will be some that are not educated in the dynamics of what this ordinance will cause that say we oppose this because we want police to racially profile others.  That is ridiculous.  It is against the law for race to be the sole indicator on profiling and no one in the profession agrees with racial profiling but passing this ordinance because a small section prohibits racial profiling is like eating a salad with a milk shake.  Any of the benefits of the salad go away after you drink the 1000 calorie shake.Let us be clear.  The City of Providence is in deep trouble.  Their crime rate is already off the chart and this Act gives all of the rights to criminals and in an odd way, gang members?Via: LawOfficerJesse Waters takes a look at Providence, RI to help understand why the unemployment is so high.

" Trump Attacks President Obama For Trying To Make Peace With Iran, Denies He Is Putin’s Puppet","Donald Trump is once again whining about the media investigating his ties to Russia, and attacked President Obama in the process.Despite having extensive business ties in Russia and connections to Vladimir Putin, whom he admires, Trump claimed in a Tuesday morning Twitter tantrum that he doesn t know the Russian tyrant nor does he have any deals there. And Trump appeared to try and excuse any deals he may have by attacking President Obama for making a diplomatic deal with Iran.I don t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy   yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2017First of all, Trump has plenty of business and financial ties to Russia.According to Time,[F]or all of his denials of Russian ties lately, Trump has boasted in the past of his many meetings with Russian oligarchs. During one trip to Moscow, Trump bragged that they all showed up to meet him to discuss projects around the globe.  Almost all of the oligarchs were in the room  just to meet with him, Trump said at the time.And when Trump built a tower in Panama, his clients were wealthy Russians, the Washington Post reported.  Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,  Trump s son, Donald Jr., said at a real estate conference in 2008.Trump has also borrowed a lot of money from Russian financial institutions over the years because American banks see him as too much of a risk due to his many bankruptcies.And second, President Obama s deal with Iran was not a business deal or one that President Obama personally profits from. It s a diplomatic deal reached to reduce Iran s nuclear program. In other words, President Obama was doing his job to keep Americans safe, unlike Trump, who has escalated tensions between the United States and Iran along with China since taking office more than two weeks ago.What s truly amazing is that Trump is still whining about being outed for his ties to Russia and Putin.

" Sarah Palin Faced Sexual Harassment At Fox News, But She Would Rather Protect The Network Than Say Something","When high-profile women like Sarah Palin stay silent, it enables sexual predators and puts more women at risk of being sexually harassed and assaulted.As Fox News continues to reel in the aftermath of Bill O Reilly s sexual harassment scandal just a year after the network dealt with Roger Ailes  own sexual harassment scandal, former contributors and anchors have been coming forward to tell their stories of how they were treated by their male colleagues there.But not Sarah Palin. Palin would rather pretend that nothing happened to her and that her male colleagues were totally professional and considerate.During an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Palin danced around the question of whether she experienced sexual harassment at the network and made it sound like her decision to leave Fox News was more about looking for different opportunities.TAPPER:  It sounds like you experienced something. PALIN:  I just   you know, it was just time to part ways and, and, you know, get   get out there in, I guess, a more diverse arena to express views. In fact, Palin had far stronger words for the victims who were repeatedly sexually harassed at Fox News than she did for the perpetrators. If a woman believes that she is being intimidated and harassed, she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years, and then after the fact complain about what she went through. Sarah Palin collected a paycheck for five years (2010-2015) from Fox News as a contributor and analyst.The sexual harassment was there from the start.In 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace remarked that  one can only hope  when asked if Palin would be sitting in his lap during an upcoming interview. Seriously.In 2011, Roger Ailes openly admitted that he only hired Palin  because she was hot and got ratings. Tucker Carlson, who has been with Fox News since 2009 and was just recently promoted to take Bill O Reilly s place, posted an incredibly sexist tweet about Palin in 2011 that he was forced to delete. Palin s popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander in Milfistan,  Carlson wrote.In other words, things haven t changed much at all at Fox News. The network merely fired an old sexual predator and replaced him with a younger one.If Palin faced this much sexual harassment at the beginning it stands to reason that she faced it constantly throughout her time at the network. And she drew a paycheck for years without doing something about it and she continues to do nothing about it. She is protecting Fox News by staying silent and that puts women who still work there at risk.Palin then went on to shame other women who haven t spoken up and once again demonstrated that she is a hypocrite. As a strong woman, I say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change. But Palin herself refused to speak up and  blow the whistle  on the men who sexually harassed her at Fox News, and she just got done shaming the women who have come forward to actually blow the whistle.This is why Sarah Palin has zero credibility and why she is not a good role model for women.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 22, 2017"
CNN INTERVIEW TURNS INTO SCREAMING MATCH When Activist Director Argues New “IRRELEVANT” Footage Of Michael Brown Is Game Changer [VIDEO],"(From CNN) New video captured hours before Michael Brown was killed shows the 18-year-old exchanging marijuana for cigarillos with the clerks of a Ferguson, Missouri, store, a documentary director told CNN on Monday.Director Jason Pollock, whose film  Stranger Fruit  debuted at the South by Southwest festival in Austin over the weekend, said the video shows that Brown did not rob the store before being stopped by police and that surveillance footage purporting to show Brown engaged in a robbery at the Ferguson Market and Liquor stores was actually video of Brown returning to the store to retrieve the cigarillos the clerks gave him. This is a shady store. We ve asked a lot of people in this community. You can buy weed at the store,  Pollock said. Pollock suggests that had this footage been released, it would ve altered the notion that Brown was shot after robbing the store. He learned of the footage from a St. Louis County police report that mentioned a video from 1:13 a.m. the day of Brown s death.In an earlier interview, in which he appeared alongside Brown s father, Pollock said,  What this video shows is that (police) lied to the world about what happened. They wanted to make Mike look bad, so they put out half a video to destroy his character in his death. Police say the new footage is irrelevant to their investigation. Investigators have previously said Officer Darren Wilson initially stopped Brown for walking in the street, not because the store reported a robbery.Watch CNN s explosive interview here:About 100 protesters gathered at the store Sunday night, forcing it to close, and gunshots were heard before midnight, but no one appeared to be injured, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Gunfire erupted last night in front of the Ferguson store where Michael Brown was captured on surveillance video shoving the store clerk around, and now seen exchanging marijuana, as rioters gear up for a new fight in Ferguson.

The guy has an incredible resume on Wiki:Michael S. Rogers (born October 31, 1959) is a United States Navy admiral who serves as Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) since April 3, 2014. Prior to that, Rogers served as the Commander of the Tenth Fleet and Commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command.Rogers is a native of Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from New Trier High School in 1977. He is a graduate of Auburn University (1981) and the Naval War College.Rogers received his commission through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program and has served in the United States Navy since graduating from Auburn University in 1981. He started his career as a Surface Warfare Officer working in naval gunfire support operations off Grenada, Beirut, and maritime surveillance operations off El Salvador. In 1986, he was selected for transfer from Unrestricted Line Officer to Restricted Line Officer and re-designation as a cryptology officer.During the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Rogers joined the military s Joint Staff, which works for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he specialized in computer network attacks. From 2007 onward he served as director of intelligence for the military s Pacific Command. In 2009, he became director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was subsequently named commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet, with responsibility for all of the Navy s cyberwarfare efforts. As such, Rogers was the first restricted line officer to serve as a numbered fleet commander and the first Information Warfare Community (IWC) officer to achieve the rank of vice admiral.In January 2014, the Obama Administration announced Rogers  nomination as director of the National Security Agency and the commander of the US offensive cyberoperations unit in the Department of Defense. Rogers succeeded General Keith B. Alexander, who served as the NSA director for nine years, and became the first IWC officer to achieve the rank of admiral. Although the NSA directorship does not require Senate approval, Rogers had to be confirmed by the Senate to head United States Cyber Command,[11] for which the Senate unanimously confirmed him.In his first public remarks as NSA director, Rogers stated that he believed that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was  probably not  working for a foreign intelligence agency, despite frequent speculation and assertion by the NSA s allies to the contrary. Rogers added:  He clearly believes in what he s doing. I question that; I don t agree with it. I fundamentally disagree with what he did. I believe it was wrong; I believe it was illegal. The Washington Post reported on 19 November 2016 that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper Jr. had recommended to President Obama that Rogers be terminated as director of the National Security Agency. Carter reportedly recommended he be terminated due to poor performance, whereas Clapper considered it wise that the position be held by a civilian. Both Clapper and Carter had put Rogers on notice for poor performance in internal security and for a poor leadership style. His termination was reportedly delayed due to stalled changes to the bureaucratic structure of the intelligence community. Later, Rogers reportedly met with then President-elect Donald Trump without notifying his supervisors in what is an unprecedented action for a military officer. Trump was reportedly considering replacing Clapper with Rogers as DNI, however that position went to former Senator Dan Coats, with Rogers remaining NSA director.",politics,"Jun 7, 2017"

FLASHBACK VIDEO Shows Leftist Media Members Praising Use Of “Nuclear Option” To Confirm (LIBERAL) Supreme Court Justices,"With Senate Republicans poised to use the  nuclear option  to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, will the liberal media hypocritically accuse them of a power grab? In 2013, when then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did basically the same thing, he was cheered on in the studios of MSNBC and CNN.Back then MSNBC s Chris Hayes hailed it as  an affirmative win for democracy,  while his colleague Rachel Maddow blurted  This is a huge freaking deal. This is like 3-inch headlines. This is like people who don t even care about politics really ought to care about this. Over on CNN, political analyst Paul Begala hailed the nakedly partisan maneuver by Reid as necessary, whining that Republicans had  so abused  the filibuster that Democrats  can t take it anymore.  And Begala s colleague Ron Brownstein approved of Reid s decision as a forward-thinking move:  The idea of requiring a super majority for the president to appoint his nominees just is anachronistic. But the cable network news hosts and analysts weren t the only ones championing the nuclear option. On the pages of the Los Angeles Times, Reid s move was celebrated in a November 22 editorial  Democrats bust the filibuster, and good for them. The Times editorial board crowed:  We welcome this action not because it represents a comeuppance for arrogant Republicans but because filibustering presidential nominees is undemocratic and violates the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution, which says that the president shall appoint judges and other officials  by and with the advice and consent of the Senate    not by and with a supermajority of the Senate.

" Trump’s Biggest KKK Fan Is Back, And He Just LOVED Those Anti-Muslim Tweets This Morning","Just in case you needed any more proof that Donald Trump s racist tweets were a thinly-coded message to his alt-right, anti-Muslim, and white supremacist followers, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK has jumped on board today in praise of President Hates-a-Lot.It wasn t enough that the KKK endorsed Trump during his campaign to stop his multitudes of followers from voting for him, so it s hard to say whether Duke s full-throated endorsement of today s disgusting display of racism will be any different. But for the average American, seeing the former Klan leader get behind Trump so vigorously should make them more than a little sick.To even go to Duke s page on Twitter is to subject yourself to a blinding cover photo, all white, with a blue-eyed  Aryan  baby in the upper corner, and the words  It s Okay To Be White  across the middle. The phrase is part of a hate campaign that  Doctor  Duke has been pushing across America, a play on the notion that there is some kind of war on white people happening.But the tweet itself is disturbing:Trump retweets video of crippled white kid in Europe being beaten by migrants, and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death, He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T. Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 29, 2017By invoking God in his message, Duke is trying the age-old tactic of pretending that white supremacy has its roots in Christianity, an angle that KKK members have tried to use for generations.Sadly, it works on some followers of both Duke s and of Donald Trump s. It seems there s quite a bit of crossover between the two racist groups. That s no surprise: The KKK were absolutely instrumental in getting Trump elected.The bottom line is, both men know exactly what they re doing when they send messages like that to their followers. Trump s racist retweets were already disgraceful enough. But continuing to leave them on his Twitter feed even after seeing praise from a Loyal White Knight like David Duke is just rubbing salt in the wound.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images",News,"November 29, 2017"

EUROPEAN VACATION: MOOCH RUNS UP A HUGE TAB COMPLIMENTS OF THE TAXPAYERS,"The Obama family continues to rack up huge bills on transportation alone when they take the thinly veiled humanitarian vacations at the taxpayer s expense. The bill for air transportation is HUGE! I can only imagine what the grand total will be.Michelle Obama s June trip to Italy and the United Kingdom cost taxpayers more than $200,000 on air transportation alone, according to documents released by a government watchdog group.The documents, obtained by Judicial Watch after filing a Freedom of Information Act request June 22, found that the First Lady s international trip in June ran $240,495.67 in airfare costs. Obama, who was accompanied by her mother and daughters, took the six-day trip in late June and made stops in London, Milan, and Vicenza. According to the Air Force documents, the flights to London, England and Milan, Venice, and Vicenza, Italy, for the June 15 21, 2015, trip totaled 20:35 hours at the cost of $11,684 per hour, bringing the flight expense total to $240,495.67,  Judicial Watch writes.The watchdog also notes that despite the White House billing the event as a part of Michelle s  Let Girls Learn  and  Let s Move  campaign, Michelle and company did their fair share of sightseeing on the trip and even sat down for tea at Kensington Place with Prince Harry.Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said that if Obama wants to have tea with Prince Harry, she is entitled to do so but not on the taxpayers  dime. The Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades,  said Fitton.  If Michelle Obama wants to take tea with Prince Harry or enthuse over Da Vinci s The Last Supper, she is certainly entitled to do so, but not at taxpayer expense. Via: WFB",politics,"Aug 21, 2015"
"‘Zero Knowledge’ Systems Not Hostile to Data Privacy, says Snowden","21st Century Wire says It s been almost two years since the cloud storage provider Dropbox appointed former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to its board. A move Edward Snowden, at the time, called  hostile  for data privacy. Snowden s comments on the matter first appeared in a video interview conducted by the Guardian, and were published in a July 17, 2014 article: Dropbox is a targeted you know wannabe PRISM partner,  he told the Guardian. They just put   Condoleezza Rice on their board  who is probably the most anti-privacy official you can imagine. She s one of the ones who oversaw Stellar Wind and thought it was a great idea. So they re very hostile to privacy. PRISM: The NSA s data collection surveillance program that every citizen should know about. PRISM and Stellar Wind were both approved and implemented during President George W. Bush s administration.  (Image: (c) Adam Hart-Davis)Dropbox and other popular cloud storage providers hold the encryption keys to hand over to the NSA should a request for your data be approved.Snowden endorses zero knowledge  systems. In layman s terms, this means that cloud storage providers NOT hostile to data privacy don t just encrypt your data, but actually host your data without their ability to access it   ever. They have zero knowledge of the contents of your data. It s a big distinction, but one easily missed by a public inundated with confusing doublespeak on data privacy.Snowden adds that s the only way they can prove to the customers that they can be trusted with their information, and makes specific reference to one cloud company, SpiderOak, as a provider of zero knowledge systems.

PAMELA GELLAR GROUP PLANS TO RUN MUHAMMED CARTOON ADS ON DC BUSES [Video]," Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Because freedom of speech is under violent assault, the human rights advocacy group the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) has announced a new ad campaign to defend freedom of speech and stand up to violent intimidation kicking off in the nation s capital.I said in a statement:  Because the media and the cultural and political elites continue to self-enforce the Sharia without the consent of the American people by refusing to show any depictions of Muhammad or showing what it was in Texas that had jihadists opening fire, we are running an ad featuring the winning cartoon by former Muslim Bosch Fawstin from our Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas. Let the American people see what the cowardly press is censoring in accordance with the blasphemy laws under the sharia (Islamic law).The ad campaign has been submitted to the Washington, D.C. MTA to run on buses and train dioramas in the Foggy Bottom, Capitol South, Bethesda, L Enfant Plaza, and Shady Grove stations. Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Either America will stand now against attempts to suppress the freedom of speech by violence, or will submit and give the violent the signal that we can be silenced by threats and murder. We cannot submit to the assassin s veto. It was the jihadis, not I, who made the cartoons a flash point. If we surrender on that point and stop drawing Muhammad, we ve established a precedent of surrendering to violent Sharia enforcement, and once established, we will be made to reinforce it again and again. Islamist government is a unique threat to free speech and libertyFreedom of speech is the foundation of a free society. Without it, a tyrant can wreak havoc unopposed, while his opponents are silenced.Putting up with being offended is essential in a pluralistic society in which people differ on basic truths. If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others.I added:  There is nothing about this cartoon that incites violence. It is within the established American tradition of satire. If America surrenders on this point, the freedom of speech is a relic of history. AFDI Vice President Robert Spencer stated:  Many people on both the Left and the Right are saying that we should do nothing to provoke Islamic fundamentalism. The immediate answer would seem to be that we should do nothing to provoke violent jihadis, that the prudent thing to do would be to avoid doing things that anger them. But if we did that, they would not they stop coming at us. Last September, an Islamic State spokesman boasted:  We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted. This is His promise to us; He is glorified and He does not fail in His promise. If we do not reach that time, then our children and grandchildren will reach it, and they will sell your sons as slaves at the slave market. In light of that, what is the point of asking whether or not we should provoke them? They re already provoked,  he continued.  A more useful question now is whether it is really productive and helpful to signal to them that we will acquiesce to their threats of violence and change our behavior accordingly, or whether we will instead signal to them that their violent threats are not going to frighten us into submission. The ads have been submitted to run on buses in Washington, D.C.AFDI stands for:The freedom of speech   as opposed to Islamic prohibitions of  blasphemy  and  slander,  which are used effectively to quash honest discussion of jihad and Islamic supremacism; The freedom of conscience   as opposed to the Islamic death penalty for apostasy; The equality of rights of all people before the law   as opposed to Sharia s institutionalized discrimination against women and non-Muslims.

 Governor Of Texas Unveils Detailed Plan To OVERTHROW The Federal Government,"There s something stirring in the Deep South that is reminiscent of when the South decided they were going to throw a hissy fit and secede from the union for not being allowed to own people as property. Some states feel that they shouldn t have to follow federal law and believe states  rights supersede the laws of the federal government.Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R), knowing in his heart of hearts that while he doesn t like that the federal government holds supremacy over the states, due to this little thing called Article 6 Section 2 of the United States Constitution, has decided to release a plan to change the Constitution. This is in an effort to change the rule of law in the United States and prohibit Congress, the Supreme Court and the president from regulating states. He seems to be calling forth for their to be an overthrow of the government by the states who don t agree with the Constitution as it is written so that they can have their own set of rules and laws.Abbott, in a bit of word play claims to have unveiled constitutional amendments to  restore the rule of law.  However, it seems he would rather not have federal law at all. Honestly? The next step after this would be secession. It looks like Abbott may be on the verge of wanting to start another Civil War.Abbott, with his own interpretation of the Constitution put out a press release that stated:Governor Greg Abbott today delivered the keynote address at the Texas Public Policy Foundation s Annual Policy Orientation where he unveiled his Texas Plan to restore the Rule of Law and return the Constitution to its intended purpose. In his plan, Governor Abbott offers nine constitutional amendments to rein in the federal government and restore the balance of power between the States and the United States. The Governor proposes achieving the constitutional amendments through a Convention Of States. The increasingly frequent departures from Constitutional principles are destroying the Rule of Law foundation on which this country was built,  said Governor Abbott.  We are succumbing to the caprice of man that our Founders fought to escape. The cure to these problems will not come from Washington D.C. Instead, the states must lead the way. To do that I am adding another item to the agenda next session. I want legislation authorizing Texas to join other states in calling for a Convention of States to fix the cracks in our Constitution. Governor Abbott went on to explain that dysfunction in Washington, D.C. stems largely from the federal government s refusal to follow the Constitution. Congress routinely violates its enumerated powers, while taxing and spending its way from one financial crisis to another. The President exceeds his executive powers to impose heavy-handed regulations. And the Supreme Court imposes its policy views under the guise of judicial interpretation. Governor Abbott urged action by Texas   and other states   to restore the Rule of Law in America.Governor Abbott offered the following constitutional amendments:Prohibit Congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one State.Require Congress to balance its budget.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from creating federal law.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from preempting state law.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision.Require a seven-justice super-majority vote for U.S. Supreme Court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law.Restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution.Give state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a federal law or regulation.The full plan can be found here.The one who seems to not want to follow the Constitution is Gov. Abbott himself. If he did he wouldn t want to amend the Constitution as it is written. He s trying to overthrow the government by stripping federal authority away from every aspect of our government as it stands today. He wants to be able to throw out decisions made by all three branches of our federal government. If this isn t treason, I don t know what is.What Abbott doesn t seem to realize is that in a nation where everyone gets a vote to elect in who they want as lawmakers, THAT is how we can change federal laws. We don t throw a hissy fit over certain laws that don t fit with the criteria of what you want for your specific state. That s what the South did before the Civil War when they wanted to own humans as property, and that what he seems to want now to overthrow any gun regulation or marriage equality. What he is proposing is going against the very fabric that makes us the United States of America. The South lost then, and he will lose now.It looks as though Abbott is trying to be the next Jefferson Davis and lead a new brand of Confederate States.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 8, 2016"
HABITUAL LIAR: Remember The Touching Story Hillary Told About Helping A Little Girl In A Wheelchair? It Was All A LIE…Here’s PROOF! [VIDEO],"Last Thursday, during Hillary s acceptance speech at the DNC, she delivered a heart-wrenching and emotional tale about a little girl in a wheelchair. Boy, that Hillary she s always thinking of the less fortunate and doesn t think twice about sticking her neck out to help the little guy. There s only one problem with Hillary s story (and pretty much everything she says) it was all a big LIE! Hillary told the crowd at the DNC and millions more who were watching her on TV, about a poor suffering handicapped girl in a wheelchair in New Bedford, Massachusetts who could not go to school because of her disability. Hillary said she helped the girl get to school.Here s part of the transcript from the LA Times: My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others.Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year. The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith:  Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can. So, I went to work for the Children s Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Mass., on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school   it just didn t seem possible in those days. And I couldn t stop thinking of my mother and what she d gone through as a child.It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. WATCH HILLARY SPIN HER BIG LIE HERE:Ken Pittman at WBSM reported:Here s what I learned; The Mayor of New Bedford in 1973 was a guy I happen to know, Mayor John Markey (81 years old and a lifelong Democrat now living in Dartmouth, MA. Mayor Markey is also a retired judge and a man whose credibility and character are beyond reproach.  Jack  as he is known, is eligible for both court and municipal pension but only accepts one. He is not one to  double dip . I called Jack and asked him a few questions about handicap services in 1973 at the New Bedford Public Schools, including wheelchair accessibility. I took over as Mayor in January of 1973. We had a budget for vans with drivers and provided services to students with disabilities. It was Tremblay Bus. They would pick them up and drop them off at their homes. Now, they may not have been able to go to the local school, depending on whether or not the schools were accessible for wheelchairs but there were many schools then which could and did accommodate our handicapped students in wheelchairs . In fact, we had a local guy who was a paraplegic, injured in a diving accident who came to my office many times to advocate for the disabled and I actually spent an entire day in 1973 in a wheelchair to better understand the challenges they face everyday. Soon after that we were cutting out sidewalks for wheelchairs and doing things in New Bedford before the laws ever compelled us to. Via: Gateway Pundit",politics,"Aug 1, 2016"
 Conservatives Are Practically Ecstatic Over The Idea That Hillary Clinton Is Sick (VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS),"With nothing of substance to go on, conservatives have recently decided that the best way to  prove  Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President is to concern-troll her health. On Monday, right-wing garbage pit Zero Hedge published an article that postulates that Hillary Clinton is not healthy enough to be President because of a photograph that began making the rounds on right-wing websites over the weekend.NORTH CHARLESTON, SC   FEBRUARY 24: Democratic Presidential candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slips as she walks up the stairs into the non-profit SC Strong, a 2 year residential facility that helps former felons, substance abusers, and homeless move into self-sufficiency February 24, 2016 in North Charleston. The South Carolina Democratic Presidential Primary is held on February 27. (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)This recent rash of attacks on Clinton for the photograph, which shows her being helped up the stairs after she slipped in February, is being presented as something recent   and certainly not as a simple stumble on the stairs. This desperate attempt to malign Clinton has, in the short time since the photo s publication, become so downright insane that Glenn Beck s  The Blaze  was forced to step in and be the voice of reason:However, despite the photo s date, conservative outlets and blogs ran with the  shock photo  to showcase the  questionable health condition  of the former secretary of state in stories dated Sunday, Aug. 7.The Drudge Report even bannered the images on its site Sunday night with links of years when Clinton has supposedly fallen. Mediaite reported that the other links on the Drudge Report homepage included a YouTube video of Clinton stumbling as she boarded Air Force One in 2011 and a New York Times story about her treatment for a blood clot in 2013.Despite that idiotic speculations about Clinton s health have officially become too insane for The Blaze, the right wing has adopted them whole-hog. Another rumor the Stupid Part of America is using to support this insane theory spawned from a photograph of Clinton slipping on a stair accuses her of having  seizures  on camera.  ZeroHedge posted random photos of Clinton coughing over the years, claiming that  Hillary has at multiple times had convulsions that appear to be seizures on camera, including a series of seemingly inexplicable coughing fits. And then there was her on-camera  seizure  that wasn t a seizure: A frequently referenced video, shown below, alleging that Hillary may have seizure-like conditions emerged several weeks ago and has so far failed to lead to a conclusive explanation whether Hillary may have ongoing health problems and potential residual aftereffects from a blood clot in her brain sustained three years ago. ZeroHedge published a choppy GIF with no sound and multiple rewinds in an effort to deceive their really, really stupid readers into believing it was actually a seizure. The actual video shows Clinton was using exaggerated facial expressions to feign surprise when she was asked if she had spoken to Elizabeth Warren about the Vice Presidency.After her exaggerated reaction, which drew laughter from those surrounding her, Clinton suggested that people try the chai, holding up her cup. Snopes noted last month that: Notably, rumors that Clinton was captured on camera undergoing a seizure didn t start circulating until well over a month later, when they were presented without any evidence beyond uninformed speculation. But, hey, why not completely misrepresent it to cause conservatives to speculate about her health? Their other baseless attacks aren t working anyway. They re even speculating about Clinton s  handler,  who appeared on stage with Secret Service when a recent rally was interrupted by protesters. The man told her to  keep talking  and assured her that the protesters would be handled.Secret Service agents walk on stage during Hillary Clinton rally https://t.co/Btp1na4Pxt  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) August 4, 2016ZeroHedge informs us that the man might be a doctor (completely without evidence) who may or may not carry something that resembles a Diazepam pen for Hillary Clinton s alleged seizures.Since these accusations are baseless at best, they are quite popular with ZeroHedge s readers:                 Sorry, conservatives, but you have shown no evidence that there is need to question Hillary s health. Back to the drawing board, I guess.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images (modified)",News,"August 8, 2016"
 Nazi-Ranting Man Accosts MSNBC Host At Iowa Caucus,"A man ranting about Nazi Germany had a strange encounter with MSNBC host and college professor Melissa Harris-Perry at the Iowa caucuses this week. Perry was with some of her students in a hotel lobby in Des Moines where a man she doesn t remember ever speaking to came up to her and began speaking, oddly acting as if they were in mid-conversation.Harris-Perry wrote about the odd incident on her website.When he started he speaking it was like he was picking up in the middle of sentence, finishing a conversation we had begun earlier, but I couldn t remember ever meeting him. So what is it that you teach? I am a professor of political science. My wife is a professor of communications. Does she teach here in Iowa? What I want to know is how you got credentialed to be on MSNBC. I am not sure if it is how he spat the word credentialed, or if it is how he took another half step toward me, or if it is how he didn t respond to my question, but the hairs on my arm stood on end. I ignored it. Told myself everything was ok. Well. It is not exactly a credential  I began. But why you? Why would they pick you? Perry said the man now sounded angry and began to get closer to her. As the victim of a previous violent crime, she became more upset and agitated at the provocation. The situation escalated:I freeze. He speaks. And moves closer. Is there a knife under the coat? A gun? Worse?And I can t hear all the words. But I catch  Nazi Germany  and I catch  rise to power.  But I can t move. I am lulled by a familiar powerlessness, muteness, that comes powerfully and unexpectedly. It grips me. Everything is falling away. Until in my peripheral vision I catch sight of a ponytail, the movement of an arm, the sound of familiar young voices and I remember  my students.She jumped up and rejoined her students, telling the hotel authorities about the bizarre encounter, though they don t appear to have taken any action.While he only got second place in the caucuses, Donald Trump s campaign has made an appeal to extremist racists and bigots, speaking in a racist manner that was previously only done behind closed doors. Now they re coming out into the light, and apparently trying to intimidate progressive figures like Harris-Perry, who have often been the target of attacks and ridicule by conservative and conservative media outlets like Rush Limbaugh and Fox News.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 2, 2016"
 Trump Stooge Nunes Just Gave the Most Immature Answer When Asked If He Will Recuse Himself (VIDEO),"Trump transition team member Devin Nunes, who inexplicably is leading the congressional investigation into Trump s ties with Russia, recently got himself in a spot of trouble when he met with a source he will not reveal on the White House grounds in the middle of the night on Wednesday to obtain sketchy intel that seems intended to back Trump s claim that President Obama  tapped  his  wires. Nunes claims that he was shown U.S. surveillance documents that indicate numerous members of the Trump team were indirectly surveilled when they contacted some shady foreign people who were being investigated. Instead of taking this information, which may or may not be true as the alleged Trump investigator refuses to show his work, to his fellow investigators Nunes admits he ran straight to the main subject of the investigation.By Thursday, Nunes was scrambling to apologize for corrupting the investigation by leaking details to the guy he s supposed to be investigating amid calls for him to recuse himself. But Nunes refuses to do so despite a clear conflict of interest.On Wednesday, CNN caught up to Nunes to ask if he will recuse himself and he decided the appropriate response was that of a third-grader:This is the mentality of the people with whom we are dealing   they are like children who have been handed too much power and are f*cking evil. But really, what did we expect given that Nunes  boss regularly employs the  I know you are but what am I?  and  But teacher, he hit me too  defenses.Watch it below:Instead of recusing himself from the #TrumpRussia investigation, @DevinNunes insults and denies   just like @realDonaldTrump. #Russiagate pic.twitter.com/0NNWxeygT7  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) March 28, 2017featured image via screengrab",News,"March 28, 2017"

 Principles Over Power: Why Republicans Need To Do What’s Right To Remain Relevant,"Over the last few weeks, I ve watched as the last shreds of the Republican Party s  family values  rotted away.As Alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in December they have two choices before them.They can vote for the Democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the Senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.In other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.They can t do both.And while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.Some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.Voting for Moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. It will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting Democrat for many years.If Republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to Moore and the people who defend him such as Donald Trump.This starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the GOP has lost. Perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the Nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the Southern Strategy ever did.And then the Republican Party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.America has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. Letting Moore step inside the Senate would send a message to the world that America supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.Such a message from the Republican Party smacks of hypocrisy. After all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton.But just like how they constantly bring up Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to claim that the Republican Party must still be great, their rhetoric about Bill Clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. The GOP is far removed from the days of Lincoln. And Bill Clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. The sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.However, by supporting Donald Trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, Republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their Bill Clinton talking point.If Moore wins next month, Republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. And the consequences will be severe.America is more diverse than ever before. Women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. Minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the GOP will no longer be able to be the party of white people. It just won t work.It s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the Republican Party.And that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.Sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. And that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate CEO or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.Republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.That s what Republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. Lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest Cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative Republicans and even a Democrat or two.And even though Lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Such a move at the time could have cost Lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.Lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. It s time for Republicans to do the same now.Seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how Republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.Today, I want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for Addicting Info.It has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years. I must first thank my readers for making this job possible. Knowing that I was informing so many people across the country and around the world motivated me to make writing about politics my career. And now it is time to move on in order to further pursue that goal.It is hard to leave the best job one has ever had. Through the years, I have made friends and lost friends. I have been here through the struggles and the triumphs. And I have done that while drastically improving as a writer and a person along the way.With that being said, it is especially hard to leave the people I work with, and there are many, both past and present, who deserve a shout-out.

 Mike Pence Tries To Talk Sh*t About Michelle Obama; Falls On Face HARD (VIDEO),"Appearing on CBS This Morning, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence was left floundering for responses to questions he clearly did not want to be asked.For one, he was asked to respond to Michelle Obama s remarks surrounding his running-mate Donald Trump being a sexual predator.Yesterday, while speaking at a Clinton campaign event in New Hampshire, the First Lady stated: This is not something that we can ignore. It s not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season. Because this was not just a lewd conversation; this wasn t just locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior and actually bragging about kissing and groping women using language so obscene that many of us worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn t an isolated incident   it s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life. She added: Too many are treating this as just another day s headline. As if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted. As if this is normal. Be clear: this is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. And it doesn t matter what party you belong to: Democrat, Independent, Republican   no woman deserves to be treated this way. None of us deserves this kind of abuse  This isn t about politics, it s about basic human decency. This Morning Co-host Norah O Donnell asked Pence about these remarks, but Pence decided to respond with this: Look I have a lot of respect for the First Lady  But I don t understand the basis of her claim. Someone flabbergasted that Pence was seemingly saying that Michelle Obama went too far, O Donnell followed up with: You don t believe his language was  sexually predatory? He was then left to put together words, in no particular order, that tried to defend Trump and his actions. Keep in mind Pence condemned Trump s remarks that came out of the leaked Access Hollywood tape, but now he doesn t seem to believe any of the victims coming forward that state Trump did exactly what he stated on that leaked tape.Someone should let him know he can t talk out of both sides of his mouth on this issue. Someone else should let him know that you don t halfass insult First Lady Michelle Obama and think he can get away with it.Pence then pivoted fast away from the questions that left him flat on his face.If Pence wasn t such a jerk himself, you could almost feel bad for the guy for needing to defend his sexual predator running-mate, but this is might just be sweet karma for all the sh*tty things Pence has done legislatively to women and the LGBT community over the years.Watch the video here:Mike Pence is so pathetic. #PatheticPence pic.twitter.com/iJ4rKyCp3P  Sarah Wood (@SarahWoodwriter) October 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 14, 2016"

 Trump Stands By Wiretapping Lie Despite EVERY Investigation Confirming It’s Bullsh*t,"According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Donald Trump is standing by his claim that former President Obama tapped the phones at Trump Tower   even though everyone has confirmed it s bullsh*t.During Monday s press briefing, which took place while FBI Director James Comey s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee was on a break, Spicer was asked about the fact that Trump s wiretapping claims had been shot down by the FBI, the Justice Department, and everybody else except for a few random conspiracy theorists. He said that there is no information to support the allegations that the President made against President Obama,  ABC s Jonathan Karl said, referring to Comey, before Spicer abruptly cut him off mid question. At this time,  Spicer said. So is the President prepared to withdraw that accusation and apologize to the President?  Karl asked. No,  Spicer replied.  We started a hearing. It s still ongoing. And then, as Chairman Nunes mentioned, this is one of a series of hearings that will be happening. While testifying on Monday, Comey said that the Department of Justice has no information  whatsoever to support Trump s ridiculous assertion that Obama, or anybody else for that matter,  wiretapped  Trump Tower. Comey said he would not  characterize  Trump s tweets about the alleged wiretapping, and said only that he has  no information  to support the accusation.On Friday, the Justice Department sent documents related to Trump  wiretapping claims to the committee. Reps. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Adam Schiff (R-Calif.) have both said publicly that there was nothing in those documents to back of Trump s accusation. We know there was not a wiretap on Trump Tower,  Nunes said.But none of this is enough to get our narcissistic tweeter-in-chief to admit that he is full of sh*t. Oh no, not Trump. He ll never back down. He lives in his own reality and is totally incapable of admitting that he is wrong. Ever.

"OPEN SOCIETY: Soros-backed, Anti-Trump Immigration Protests ‘Sprung from Nowhere’ at Airports Across America","21st Century Wire says This week a US presidential executive order temporarily restricted travelers and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering America. In response to the controversial order, a wave of anti-Trump  flash mob  protests emerged seemingly out of nowhere at New York s JFK Airport and other airports across the nation. Welcome to the brave new world of digital activism, driven by some of the world wealthiest men   ENGINEERING CRISIS    George Soros tied to protests over Trump s recent executive order concerning immigration.  (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)While the airport angst appeared to be an organic effort to reject Trump s executive order on immigration, it was revealed that the heavily organized protests were found to be tied to social movement billionaire financier George Soros. Participating groups included the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Immigration Law Center, the Urban Jusric Center, and  Make The Road  advocacy group, to name only a few   are all funded by Soros front organizations led by his Open Society Foundation.The airport protests erupted just a week after a string of multi-million dollar Soros-linked/Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was dubbed a  Women s March on Washington DC. The Soros-backed women s march  was full of Hollywood celebrities in addition to a bevy of other speakers that included Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, activist Gloria Steinem, filmmaker Michael Moore, as well as the convicted felon Donna Hylton, who took part in kidnapping and torturing a 62-year-old real-estate broker named Thomas Vigliarole, in a botched ransom plot from 1985.The recent airport protests and mainstream media reportage regarding the immigration based executive order prompted a response from President Donald Trump over the past 24 hours:Below will take a closer look at the main outline of the immigration based executive order, as another wave of Soros-backed political opposition has been triggered into action  (Image Source: abcnews.com)Here are the key provisions of the immigration order outlined by the Trump administration:Whether or not someone supports the new US immigration order, it is strange that the list does not include other countries linked to state-sponsored terror such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Pakistan. From a security standpoint, by leaving out these terrorist-linked and terrorist sponsor countries   Trump s executive order makes little sense.In a press release from February of 2016, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) outlined travel orders similar to Trump s immigration EO based on the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Here s a passage of the DHS release discussing travel restrictions concerning the exact countries included in the Trump order: The Department of Homeland Security today announced that it is continuing its implementation of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 with the addition of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as three countries of concern, limiting Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries. Pursuant to the Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security had sixty days to determine whether additional countries or areas of concern should be subject to the travel or dual nationality restrictions under the Act. After careful consideration, and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined that Libya, Somalia, and Yemen be included as countries of concern, specifically for individuals who have traveled to these countries since March 1, 2011. At this time, the restriction on Visa Waiver Program travel will not apply to dual nationals of these three countries. DHS continues to consult with the Department of State and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to develop further criteria to determine whether other countries would be added to this list. Last month, the United States began implementing changes under the Act. The three additional countries designated today join Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria as countries subject to restrictions for Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals. Under the new law, the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these restrictions if he determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include individuals who traveled to these countries on behalf of international organizations, regional organizations, and sub-national governments on official duty; on behalf of a humanitarian NGO on official duty; or as a journalist for reporting purposes. Additionally, under the Obama administration, during the Syrian refugee resettlement program US entrance for Iraqi refugees was halted for 6 months in 2011.Interestingly, several Soros-linked organizations led the charge following the detention of immigrant travelers at airports in America over this past weekend. The ACLU, and the immigration-advocacy group Make The Road, both Soros linked entities, were heavily involved in organizing political opposition concerning the Trump immigration order.In 2014, it was disclosed that George Soros s Open Society Foundations granted $50 million dollars to the ACLU. Additionally, a law suit filed by ACLU associated lawyers and The National Immigration Law Center led to a stay of President Trump s executive orders over the past 48 hours.Breitbart recently reported that the  The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. RT reported the following on January 30th: Three more federal judges, along with a district judge, have issued rulings barring authorities from deporting people detained at US airports following President Donald Trump s executive order restricting entry to travelers from seven countries with Muslim-majorities. Whether in the flesh, social media or through mainstream TV, the populace is subject to various forms of hyperreal propaganda around the global   in many ways this is being used to push certain political regime changes and party objectives through the use of deceptive color revolutions and their many incarnations.In a book from 2011 written by Susanne Elizabeth Shawyer entitled  Radical Street Theatre and the Yippie Legacy: A Performance History of the Youth International Party, 1967 1968,  we gain a clearer perspective of the term  Smart Mobs   and the nature of these cross-platform gatherings: The potential for ideological uses of flash mobs soon became clear by autumn 2003. Because of its original apolitical nature and network organization, the flash mob was easily appropriated for other means beyond random fun. Flash mobs were soon used for political or commercial end by those seeking to capitalize on the trendy cultural capital of flash mobs. Adding to that, Shawyer cites author social science critic Howard Rheingold, who penned a book entitled  Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution  in 2003 and continued to outline the nature of smart mobs: A smart mob may be composed of strangers who have no relationship to each other beyond their mutual connection to the network, yet this connection creates a virtual community and provides the opportunity for collective action. When looking at the smart mob phenomena concerning the recent anti-trump protests in America, we can see how a large block of people can become useful in spreading political or cultural memes.In addition, the blending of socially engineered political agitator mobs and color revolutions is becoming more and more imperceptible as any group-think meme can cause a sudden flash gathering for the cause of the day.Controversial filmmaker Michael Moore took to social media to rouse the masses, while acknowledging that the Soros-backed NGO MoveOn.org mobilized a protest directly outside of the White House . Debra Heine PJ MediaThe flurry of anguished news stories and protests surrounding President Trump s executive action temporarily suspending  immigrants and non-immigrants  from  countries of particular concern  appears to be part of a coordinated PR effort financed by left-wing billionaire George Soros.Rather than a complete  Muslim ban  as promised during the campaign, Trump s executive order contains moderate refugee restrictions, similar to those that have been implemented by President Obama. If reports are true that restrictions are being applied even to green-card holders, that is an unfortunate misapplication of the law that will likely soon be corrected.Protesters quickly materialized Saturday at JFK Airport, where some refugees were being temporarily detained.Who are these people? Make the Road  is a NY-based far-left non-profit funded in part by George Soros.According to Breitbart s Aaron Klein, the signatories to the lawsuit filed Saturday to block Trump s executive order included immigration lawyers from groups financed by Soros.At least one case quickly prompted a legal challenge as lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy International Airport in New York filed a motion early Saturday seeking to have their clients released. They also filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and other immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.The suit was filed by lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project, the National Immigration Law Center, the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the International Refugee Assistance Project (formerly Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project) at the Urban Justice Center.The ACLU is massively funded by Soros s Open Society Foundations, including with a $50 million grant in 2014.The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support.The Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant.Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center s International Refugee Assistance Project, which is listed on the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros s Open Society Foundations.Reportedly, open-borders advocate Soros has provided some $76 million for immigrant issues over the past decade, as Soros-funded immigrant rights groups  helped influence President Obama s immigration policy.PJ Media continues here..READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 31, 2017"
 Elizabeth Warren Has Some News As To Who She’s Endorsing,"If there s one person who is loved by all in the Democratic Party, it s Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Her no-nonsense attitude and get it done approach to policy and politics are things that cannot be matched. She is so loved that her endorsement of any particular candidate is one that is sought after and coveted.People have been waiting on pins and needles to see who Warren will endorse in the Democratic primary. Will it be Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton? And after the Iowa caucuses, where Hillary and Bernie were in a statistical tie, people would like to know now, more than ever, who she will pick in hopes that it will push one candidate ahead over the other.However, Warren, being the magnificent person that she is, is choosing to focus on the issues  and not to politicize things by muddying the waters with support for any one candidate, said: No endorsements now. I think that what the Democrats are doing is terrific. We re out talking about the issues. I look at the Republican debates and the difference between what they re doing and what the Democrats are doing that really shows who s on whose side. Warren knows that when you pick a particular side of the debate the message can sometimes be lost. Both Hillary and Bernie are talking about the economy. Both Hillary and Bernie are talking about making healthcare and college affordable. Both Hillary and Bernie are seeking to continue progress in the United States and not let the reins fall back in to the hands of Republicans. Warren is letting the issues be explored, and solutions be offered, while letting the people decide for themselves.Both candidates running would love a Warren endorsement. She s showed support for both Sanders and Clinton in their approach to Wall Street and what needs to be done. So, while many supporters of either candidate will love to say that she s  hinted  at one candidate or the other, cases can be made for both. So, like Warren said in regards to if she ll announce who she s endorsing,  we ll see.  And everyone knows that s code for,  I m not telling you either way.

 Utah’s Oldest Paper DEMANDS Trump Drop Out Of Race In Scathing Must-Read Editorial,"As the Deseret News said on Saturday, they haven t endorsed a candidate in 80 years, but they made it clear who shouldn t be president in a damning editorial Trump supporters are going to hate. We are neutral on matters of partisan politics,  the editorial began.  We do, however, feel a duty to speak clearly on issues that affect the well-being and morals of the nation. Accordingly, today we call on Donald Trump to step down from his pursuit of the American presidency. Unlike some evangelical conservative  Christian  leaders like Tony Perkins and Ralph Reed, who still support Trump even after his lewd comments about groping women dropped like a bombshell on Friday, the Mormon-owned newspaper roundly condemned Trump and called for him to resign his candidacy, citing his lack of character.The idea that women secretly welcome the unbridled and aggressive sexual advances of powerful men has led to the mistreatment, sorrow and subjugation of countless women for far too much of human history.The notion that strength emanates from harsh, divisive and unbending rhetorical flourish mistakenly equates leadership with craven intimidation.The belief that the party and the platform matter more than the character of the candidate ignores the wisdom of the ages that,  when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.  (ProverbsThe editorial pointed to Trump s history of making misogynistic comments about women and said that Trump has failed time and time again to demonstrate the  ethical behavior  that presidents need to govern a nation with compassion, understanding, and respect. And then the editorial took aim at Trump s supporters.In the face of these revelations, it is disheartening to see otherwise decent individuals now attempting to defend Trump s talk, dismissing it as mere  locker room  bravado. At the time of the audio recording, Trump was not a hormonal teenage athlete, but rather a 60-year-old husband of an expectant mother and the father of four children.America s locker rooms deserve better.The Deseret News concluded by calling on Trump to resign but if he doesn t, Americans need to stand against him in November.This is one of those rare moments where it is necessary to take a clear stand against the hucksterism, misogyny, narcissism and latent despotism that infect the Trump campaign even as we hope for a more auspicious future of liberty, prosperity and peace for the nation.And it looks like the people will have to take that stand in November because Donald Trump has vowed to stay in the race. Let s just hope voters reject him by a landslide so that Republicans are never stupid enough to nominate someone like him ever again.Featured Image: Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"October 8, 2016"

"BREAKING! Ammon, Ryan Bundy, 5 Fellow Patriots: NOT Guilty On ALL Charges Related To Oregon Standoff! [VIDEO]","Who could forget the unbelievable standoff in Oregon between patriots and the government?  Who could forget the dramatic shooting of patriot Savoy Finicum who traveled from Arizona to Oregon from to stand with American ranchers against the BLM, an overbearing government agency. Oregon State Police troopers fired the three rounds that killed the Arizona rancher and father of 11 during a confrontation on a remote road, law enforcement officials said at a news conference in Bend.An independent investigation by Oregon authorities later found the troopers were justified in shooting Finicum because he failed to heed their commands and repeatedly reached for his weapon, Masher County District Attorney Dan Norris said.The not guilty verdict of the other members who were involved with Finicum who gave his life for the fight against our government, must be especially stinging for the large loving  family this father of 11 left behind.As expected, liberals are freaking out over the verdicts, like this Black Lives Matter crybaby:I have a criminal record for protesting for #FreddieGray meanwhile #oregonstandoff terrorists didn't even get a slap on the wrist.  Kwame Rose (@kwamerose) October 28, 2016Here are the verdicts. #oregonstandoff pic.twitter.com/fXW9GoxKUr  Ryan Haas (@ryanjhaas) October 27, 2016Ammon and Ryan Bundy have been found not guilty of conspiracy. Their five co-defendants Jeff Banta, Shawna Cox, David Fry, Kenneth Medenbach and Neil Wampler have all been found not guilty as well. Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on Ryan Bundy s theft of government property charge.The jury returned its verdict after some six weeks of testimony followed by less than six hours deliberations, and the last minute replacement of a juror after an allegation surfaced that he was biased.The jury was instructed to disregard their previous work and to re-consider the evidence. It was a pretty jaw-dropping verdict,  said OPB reporter Amelia Templeton of the climate in the courtroom. The jury began by reading out the verdict for Ammon Bundy, ostensibly the leader of the occupation, and when we heard that Ammon Bundy was not guilty, it became clear very quickly that likely no one in the case was going to be found guilty, and indeed, everyone has been acquitted. After the verdict was read, Ammon Bundy s attorney Marcus Mumford was tackled to the ground by five U.S. Marshals. He insisted his client was free to go. Ammon Bundy faces a US Marshall hold and is supposed to be transferred to Nevada where he faces charges for the Bunkerville standoff. There s a hold for Ammon Bundy and Ryan Bundy out of the district of Nevada,  said Matt Schindler attorney for Kenneth Medenbach. There s nothing Judge Brown can do about that. So acquitting him here, all it does is effectively release him to that hold, to be transported to Nevada. And the court that has anything authority to deal with that, is the court in Nevada. Marcus let the emotion of the moment, I think, overtake his better judgement. During the incident, Judge Brown ordered everyone out of the courthouse. Mumford was later detained.United States Attorney for the District of Oregon Billy J. Williams reacted to the decision on Thursday saying,  While we had hoped for a different outcome, we respect the verdict of the jury and thank them for their dedicated service during this long and difficult trial.  The charges stem from the 41-day armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns in eastern Oregon s high desert. The armed protest began Jan. 2 and ended when the final four occupiers surrendered to the FBI on Feb. 11. For many weeks, hundreds of law enforcement officers   federal, state, and local   worked around-the-clock to resolve the armed occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge peacefully,  said Greg Bretzing, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Oregon.  Although we are extremely disappointed in the verdict, we respect the court and the role of the jury in the American judicial system. Prosecutors initially charged Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy, and 24 others with conspiracy to prevent Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife employees from doing their jobs at the wildlife refuge in Harney County. Some defendants named in the indictment faced weapons charges for carrying firearms in a federal facility, as well as theft of government property.Only seven defendants went to trial in September. Others have pleaded guilty or are scheduled to go to trial in February 2017. Oregonian ",Government News,"Oct 27, 2016"

" Trump Lies To His Supporters, Claims CBS Edited His Words To Make Him Look Bad","Donald Trump has once again decided to lie to his supporters and accuse a major news network of editing his words to explain away his abortion views.Last week, Trump took five different stances on abortion. First, he said women who have them should be punished. Then he said it should be left up to the states. After that, he changed his mind again and  clarified  his original statement by saying doctors who perform abortions should be punished. His fourth position came when he gave an interview for CBS s Face The Nation and claimed that he wouldn t do anything to change abortion laws because the Supreme Court has already decided on their legality with Roe v Wade.When the media said, Wait a second Trump just took a pro-choice stance on abortion by declaring it should remain legal,  his campaign put out a statement saying he would, in fact, try to outlaw it with judicial appointments   taking his fifth abortion position of the week.Well, on Saturday while speaking at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, the Republican frontrunner implied that CBS edited words out of his statement in an attempt to smear him. According to CNN: They can take something you say and turn it around. Like I will be on CBS s  Face the Nation.  What I said was perfect,  Trump explained, adding,  What I said was so good. It was so perfect. And they looked and said,  Oh, maybe he should have added a word.' Well, actually the way it came out, they took words out that I said,  he added.  The only reason I tell you this is because I want you to watch it. If I did something wrong, I wouldn t want you to watch it. Clearly, his words were not as  perfect  as he thought since he now feels the need to explain them away by lying to his supporters. He went on to say that the media often edits his words: The problem is they don t do it with everybody. They do it with me. But I don t see them doing it with other people. Wow! It s pretty convenient that the media only edits him, don t you think?CNN apparently reached out to CBS for comment and a spokeswoman said, nothing in that section he reference was edited.  That s exactly the same response that MSNBC had last week when Trump accused them of the very same thing.It is amazing that this guy can literally lie all the time and his supporters don t care at all. It s even funnier when these same supporters turn around and call President Obama a liar.

 Trump Goes Birther On Federal Judge Presiding Over Trump U Fraud Case: He’s A ‘Mexican!’,"Donald Trump has repeatedly sworn he loves Hispanics and Hispanics love him, but not   apparently   when it comes to the judge presiding over his Trump University fraud trial.Trump, whose guilt in this case is almost beyond doubt, swears that if he loses the case (which is looking likely), it s not because he is a shameless con man. No, it s because the judge is a  hater  and a Mexican. We re in front of a very hostile judge,  Mr. Trump said.  The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, federal judge. Frankly, he should recuse himself because he s given us ruling after ruling after ruling, negative, negative, negative. What happens is the judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that s fine,  Mr. Trump said.The only problem: Judge Gonzalo Curiel is from Indiana not Mexico. Which is great. I think Indiana s fine.It s not the first time Trump has gone birther, of course. He famously set fire to piles of his own money in a quixotic quest to prove President Obama wasn t born in the United States. At several points, Trump even claimed to have proof, but never produced a single shred of evidence. His new accusations do, however, represent the first time Trump has claimed Mexicans   aside from being rapists and drug dealers   are infiltrating the federal justice system to screw over Trump personally.Why would they do that? Trump supporters seem to believe it s because of Trump s immigration plans. Facing a crowd of supporters who had killed time before Trump got up to the podium by mindlessly chanting  build that wall,  Trump knew exactly what he was doing when he suddenly floated the idea that the judge who is about to rule against him is a secret Mexican. He was quite literally preaching to the choir.All of this undermines Trump s assurances that Hispanic voters will flock to him in November. If he sincerely believes a federal judge would be prejudiced against him in his court case because of his Hispanic heritage, then it s not hard to imagine the rest of the Hispanic and Latino population would be repulsed by his message of anti-immigrant hate. He can t have it both ways.Trump closed his remarks by promising to file a lawsuit against Judge Curiel when he becomes president. I m telling you, this court system, judges in this court system, federal court, they ought to look into Judge Curiel. Because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace, OK? But we ll come back in November. Wouldn t that be wild if I m president and I come back to do a civil case? The audience roared   the same audience that at one time probably raged at President Obama for taking a day to go golfing. Suddenly, a president who spends his time in office wrapped up in a personal civil case to settle a grudge is A-OK.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 28, 2016"
FARMER FINED A WHOPPING $2.8 MILLION Asks President Trump For Help,"A California farmer fined $2.8 million for plowing through vernal pools protected by the Clean Water Act without a permit is appealing to the Trump administration for help, according to California s Record Spotlight.John Duarte has sent letters to Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions seeking clarification on the federal government s case against him, the Record Spotlight reports.While the Clean Water Act protects  waters of the U.S.,  it does contain exemptions for farmers.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fined Duarte Nursery, owned by Duarte, in 2012 for failing to get a permit before plowing through vernal pools located on a recently purchased 450 acre plot of land. The vernal pools, temporary bodies of water that house certain species of plants and animals, are protected as waters of the United States by the Clean Water Act of 1972. We expected the Trump administration to provide regulatory relief from Obama-era overreach, and we haven t seen it yet,  Duarte said according to the Record Spotlight.  We re hoping to see the administration engage this issue, to look at it again. House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conway and House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte sided with Duarte, sending a letter to Sessions May 26 questioning the merit of the Duarte case.Read more: DC",politics,"Jul 29, 2017"
 How Much Impact Will Superdelegates Have In The Democratic Primary?,"Superdelegates can, and very likely will, have an impact on the democratic primary process. But how much influence remains to be seen.As Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight writes here, superdelegates are democratic insiders who hold voting power apart from that of ordinary delegates.Silver explains: Superdelegates were created in part to give Democratic party elites the opportunity to put their finger on the scale and prevent nominations like those of George McGovern in 1972 or Jimmy Carter in 1976, which displeased party insiders. While Silver agrees with many progressive voters, who say that the superdelegate system is  profoundly unfair,  he also notes that the amount of influence superdelegates have on the outcome of a primary race depends largely on how close the race is.There are approximately 712 superdelegates. These delegates equal about one-sixth of the 4,763 delegates who will determine the outcome of the primary. In order to win the party s nomination, a candidate needs to secure at least 2,382 delegates.According to Silver: Superdelegates are mathematically relevant when a candidate has 41.2 percent to 58.8 percent of elected delegates. Below that range, a candidate couldn t win a first-ballot majority even with the votes of every superdelegate; above that range, the superdelegates  help wouldn t be necessary to clinch the nomination. To clarify, the following chart was published on FiveThirtyEight, on February 12.The chart shows the percentage of superdelegate votes a candidate would need to win the primary, in correlation to the percentage of regular delegates, which are awarded based on the outcomes of state primary elections.Image credit: screen capture Nate Silver fivethirtyeight.comAs the chart illustrates, the closer the race is, the more impact the superdelegates have on the outcome.Currently Hillary Clinton holds a tremendous lead over Bernie Sanders among pledged superdelegates. Clinton has the support of 362 superdelegates, while Sanders has only captured the support of eight superdelegates thus far.But Silver also points out that superdelegates are free to change their vote at any time during the race, and notes that they often do just that. Unlike elected delegates, superdelegates are unbound to any candidate even on the first ballot. They can switch whenever they like, and some of them probably will switch to Sanders if he extends his winning streak into more diverse states and eventually appears to have more of a mandate than Clinton among Democratic voters. Additionally, Silver states that it s highly unlikely superdelegates would back a candidate who had lost the popular vote by any significant margin, since doing so would likely alienate over half the party s base.So while at the moment it may appear that party insiders are attempting to override the popular vote, it s not likely that the superdelegates will ignore or deny the will of the voters, should they favor Sanders by a significant margin.Silver points to 2008 as an example of how fast things can change. Clinton had a large superdelegate lead over then-senator Barack Obama early on during the 2008 democratic primary, as well. But as the election wore on, several dozen superdelegates changed their original vote from Clinton to Obama. At the same time, uncommitted superdelegates came out in support of his candidacy.So while superdelegates definitely have the power to influence the outcome of an election, especially in the case of very close race, it s important to keep in mind that voters also have the power to influence the decisions of the superdelegates.View a state-by-state list of democratic superdelegates here.

CONSERVATIVE MOM And Cruz Supporter Goes All In For TRUMP…And Here’s Why,"A message from a 100% FED UP mom to her Facebook friends:Dear friends,I donated to two presidential campaigns this year, Dr. Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. I voted for Rand Paul in the straw poll at the Republican convention on Mackinac Island, MI in September. I am proud to say that today, I am 100% behind Donald Trump. I am actually looking forward to watching him CRUSH Hillary in the general election.After watching Barack Hussein Obama serve as our cowardly, racist, incompetent, Divider In Chief for eight long years, I m ready for a President with courage and the ability to make this country truly great again. I want someone who tells the free loaders, drug dealers and gang members from Mexico and Central America they re not welcome here anymore. I want a border that cannot be penetrated, and if it is, I want our Border Patrol agents to be able to do the jobs they were trained to do. I want a President who isn t afraid to say we need to address the issue of unchecked immigration into our country from Muslim majority nations who want to destroy our way of life. I want a President who won t run to the golf course after an innocent American is beheaded or lie to Americans about a video after four brave Americans are killed all because his Secretary of State wouldn t give them what they needed to survive in Benghazi. I want a President who will heal the racial divide our current President instigated with his former DOJ and his inner circle of race baiters for hire. I want a President who will unleash our natural resources so we won t have to be dependent on ISIS, Saudi Arabia and Iran for oil. I want a President who won t visit communist countries and spend the afternoon watching baseball with brutal dictators, behaving as though he was spending the day with the Pope. I want a President who respects the hard work of EVERY man and woman in America, and understands that in order to achieve the American dream, we need to work hard and make a few sacrifices. I want a President who refuses to allow the media to control the narrative. I want a President who has raised a family he can be proud of and for that matter, that America can be proud of. For all those reasons and many, many more, I am excited that Donald J. Trump will be the Republican candidate for President.As a side note, I m also looking to clean up my friends list. If any of my Facebook  friends  feel it is more important to thump their chests and demand that they will never vote for Trump (or in other words, that they will support Hillary) kindly hit the un-friend button at the top of my page. I m on the side of America, and I m choosing to support a man who loves his country so much that he s wiling to walk away from everything he s worked so hard to build in order to save us. Trump didn t ask to walk through barricades to get away from hateful liberals in CA who would like harm him. He didn t ask for Soros funded freaks to follow him wherever he goes, threatening violence against him and his supporters. He could be sitting in Trump Towers working on multimillion dollar deals, but God chose a different path for him and he accepted the challenge. I am grateful to him for the sacrifices he and his family will make, and I will pray that God keeps him safe, healthy and strong. Most of all, I will pray that he brings jobs back to the millions of unemployed Americans who have given up hope on ever finding a job. I will pray that he follows through on his promise to help our veterans to get the best health care America has to offer. And finally, I will pray that he rebuilds our military and gives our soldiers the ability to fight to win, and to keep the greatest nation in the world safe and prosperous for generations to come.There is no time to waste with petty bickering. While I understand there will be a lot of hard feelings amongst Ted, Carly and Marco supporters, it s time to come together now for the good of our country.Bill Clinton is walking around in a state of mostly confusion, while Hillary is traveling with a full-time physician. In addition to being the MOST crooked candidate to ever run for President, she is not well. She will likely chose the old Socialist Bernie Sanders as her running mate to shore up the young voters she cannot persuade to support her campaign. Sadly, Hillary knows she can t win without the  I just want free-shit  vote. Together, they will destroy more businesses, as they increase EPA regulations to fight a phony climate change war. They ll decrease spending for our military in order to reallocate funds to more social programs and programs designed to tighten the screws on our law enforcement, making it nearly impossible for them to do their jobs. The conditions at our VA hospitals will worsen, as our tax dollars will be used to pay for free college for young people who have no clue what it means to selflessly serve their country. There will be a push for gun control like we ve never seen before in America, and we will witness some of the most radical Supreme Court picks who will wholly support their progressive agenda. Meanwhile, people who have the ability to stop another four years of Obama will be proudly tweeting #NeverTrump, as though we should admire them for their courage to stand up for their  principles! I have three young daughters. I won t give up this fight until I know we have a President who takes the threat of Sharia Law in America seriously. For anyone who thinks that can t happen, London is on the verge of electing a radical Muslim as their next Mayor, as I write this rant.When November rolls around, I ll be supporting a candidate who isn t worried about hurting the feelings of a radical Muslim with a suicide vest in his suitcase, as he travels (at the expense of the American taxpayer) to his new taxpayer funded home in my neighborhood. It s time to wise up and start coming together like the Democrats do after each and every primary. It s time to try something new it s called  winning.  #NeverHillary!

HILLARY PANDERS TO BLACK RADIO HOSTS In Attempt To Tie Herself To Racist Beyonce Song…Host Asks If She Needs Mouth To Mouth Or CPR? [WATCH],"The Breakfast Club interview started out when one of the hosts, Charlemagne Tha god told his audience,  Let the record show, when she [Hillary] walked in, I gave her a handshake and she did it the right way. She bought it in, cuffed it and everything.  Cackling ensued One of the tough questions Hillary got during her interview was,  Do you believe in ghosts?  She was also asked if her pants suits are inspired by game show host Steve Harvey. Instead of admitting that she might lose half of her voting base if they were to see her in a dress, she carries on forever about the ease of a pants suit. Between coughing fits, Hillary was able to sneak in another ridiculous lie.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Monday said that she always keeps a bottle of hot sauce handy in her bag. Hot sauce,  she said when asked what she constantly carries in her bag.The comments, first reported by TMZ, came during an appearance on Power 105.1 FM s  The Breakfast Club. Really? Are you getting in that  Formation  right now?  host Charlamagne Tha God asked before quoting Beyonce s song  Formation.   Hot sauce in my bag, swag? Clinton said that she was indeed serious, leading the host to joke that Clinton is angling for African American voters with a Beyonce reference.Here is the Refrain from Beyonc s anti-cop, racist  Formation  song: Y all haters corny with that lluminati mess Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh I m so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin ) I m so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils Earned all this money but they never take the country out me I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag I want you to know that people are going to see this and say,  she s pandering to black people again,  he told Clinton. OK   is it working?  the Democratic presidential front-runner quipped.  Seriously   I ve been eating a lot of hot sauce and raw peppers.  Via: The HillThe  hot sauce  comment can be seen at the 25 minute mark: Excuse me,  she said coughing, after speaking for about 20 minutes on the air. Allergy season,  she said, as she continued coughing, reaching for her drink. You all right? Any mouth to mouth CPR?  one of the hosts joked, trying to lighten the mood. Senator, you coughing like you have something medicinal,  another host said. Yeah, I need some,  she replied as the hosts laughed. My voice is failing here,  she said as she continued speaking in a faltering tone. The interview went on for about three additional minutes before staffers ended it.Clinton has had multiple coughing episodes during her campaign for president, awkwardly interrupting speeches or interviews as she struggles to regain her voice. She also had a coughing episode during her testimony during the Congressional Benghazi hearings. Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Apr 19, 2016"

"US-Saudi Plan: Let 9,000 ISIS Fighters Walk Free from Mosul – to Fight in Syria"," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireJudging by both the words, and deeds of the Obama White House and its political  diplomatic  appointees led by perfidious John Kerry and caustic Samantha Power   all evidence to date points to the US wanting to escalate its war on Syria   while happily baiting a military confrontation, and World War  scenario with Russia and its allies in the process. If this latest leak is indeed true   and time will certainly tell whether or not it is, it would constitute one of the most egregious violations of both US and international law   by the United States government and its theocratic dictator partner in Saudi Arabia.Washington s own anti-terror legislation expressly forbids colluding to provide logistical or material support for terrorist groups, and this US-Saudi venture would be the latest in a long list of violations  According to news released today (see report below), US President Barack Obama has been briefed that the operation to liberate the ISIS stronghold in Mosul in Iraq is scheduled for the second half of October. Here s what makes this a potential shocker: the operation allows for safe passage for 9,000 ISIS fighters on the proviso that they are transferred from Iraq to eastern Syria in order to help US plans for  regime change  there. At the time of the assault, coalition aircraft would strike only on a pre-agreed detached buildings in the city, which are empty, the source said. According to him [the source], the plan of Washington and Riyadh also provides that the rebels move from Mosul to Syria for the attack on the government-controlled town of troops. Essentially, Washington and Saudi Arabia, will allow 9,000 ISIS (Islamic State) fighter FREE passage into Syria if they agree to join Washington s  regime change  operations there. This could also include,   eastern regions of Syria to follow a major offensive operation, which involves the capture of Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source added.Before you write this story off as some ornate Russian psychological operation, consider the long trend arch. The US along with its generous Gulf sidekicks, have already established a solid track record of aiding and abetting ISIS   not just in Syria, but in Iraq too.The record shows that the US is guilty on a number of counts If the Mosul leak is true, then it wouldn t be the first time that the US has provided cover in the military pantomime the world has come to know as  the fight against ISIS.  When large ISIS convoys crossed the Syrian desert to invade and occupy the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra in May 2015, the US  Coalition  airforce did nothing, and allowed ISIS to take and destroy part of the world s great historic cultural heritage, along with the murder of scores of innocent civilians.Professor Tim Anderson from Sydney University states: U.S. weapons with Israeli ammunition were used by Islamic State group when taking over Palmyra. The extremists also had U.S. military rations. The U.S., which since 2014 claimed to be conducting a war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and which had air power and sophisticated surveillance of the region, did nothing to stop the huge ISIS advance on Palmyra. The US isn t even shy about its laissez-faire policy with ISIS in the field, with the New York Times openly boasting,  Any airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Palmyra would probably benefit the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. So far, United States-led airstrikes in Syria have largely focused on areas far outside government control, to avoid the perception of aiding a leader whose ouster President Obama has called for. Following the derelict incident, New York Times reporters Hwaida Saad and Kareem Fahim, were still kicking and screaming for  regime change like petulant children at the news of ISIS fleeing and Palmyra being liberated by the Syrian Army and Russians. They said that,  Mr. Assad s contention that his government is a bulwark against the transnational extremist group  has been bolstered, but added that  his foes and some allies argue that he must leave power as part of a political settlement to end the war in Syria. In other words:  we still want regime change!  This says volumes about who is really enforcing New York Times editorial lines (either the US State Dept, or the CIA, take your pick).More importantly however, is what kind of message an US statement like that sends to ISIS, as well as Al Nusra and other terrorist brigades inside Syria, which is basically,  we do not need to worry about US air strikes, only Syrian Army and Russian strikes.  This situation really sums up the utter fraud and contempt of the US deception in Syria, and it s no surprise that the Russian Foreign Ministry are reticent to extend themselves any more where the US is concerned.Then, in March 2016, when ISIS fled Palmyra, back across the desert towards Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa   the great and powerful US  Coalition  airforce actually helped ISIS in a number of ways, including allowing them free passage once more.In late August, we were told that the Turkish Army, alongside  allied Syrian rebels  (terrorist group Faylaq al-Sham) backed by the US air cover, invaded Syria in order to capture the  ISIS-held  town of Jarabulus, Syria, this supposedly to cut off ISIS s last open route into Turkey. But what happened to ISIS?The NYT even admitted that,  it appeared that most of the militants had fled without a fight. Here, ISIS appears to have been given advanced warning   by either US or Turkish intelligence, as they left the contested town of Jarabulus quietly, but in droves. In reality, Turkey twisted this operation in order to attack and degrade Kurdish militias including the US-backed artificial construct called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and pro-Kurdish People s Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the Syrian affiliate of the militant Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) in Iraq and Turkey   all of whom are meant to be fighting ISIS. Instead, they are now busy dodging Turkish artillery rounds. Confusing, yes, but true nonetheless.It s also common knowledge now, that top of the line US weaponry is being used by ISIS, both in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Syria as well. In fact, if not for US weapons and supplies (along with US air intervention, or noninterventions), ISIS would have struggled to maintain many of the strategic positions it enjoys today. For the last 3 years, US officials have been dodging this issue, and when they do admit this is true, their patronizing party line is that,  this must be a mistake, if they do have US weapons, we didn t mean it.  As if the world was born yesterday.Perhaps the most flagrant violation by the US-led forces in aiding and abetting ISIS took place on Sept 17, 2016, when the US-led Coalition bombed Syrian Army positions outside of Deir ez-Zor near al-Tharda Mountain, killing some 80 soldiers and injuring 100 more.  As if by design, an ISIS offensive began immediately following the US massacre of Syrian soldiers. Clearly, this bold move by the Pentagon paved the way for a major ISIS advance.To any normal observer, the US attack was a belligerent act of war that effective destroyed an already fragile bilateral ceasefire agreement, and yet the US response was to somehow blame Russia for calling an emergency UNSC meeting to discuss the incident. Judging by this response, it s pretty clear that US wants to see the Syrian Conflict carry on for a while, and it will need groups like ISIS to make that happen. The other problem with Washington s hollow righteousness in the Middle East is that there are key members of the US-led Coalition  who are financing ISIS, Al Nusra Front, Nour al Din Zinki, and Arar al Sham (all  moderate terrorists we re told) militants in Syria, Iraq and beyond. This fact was recently admitted by former US Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, as revealed in this week s batch of Wikileaks emails. Clinton writes: While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Add to that the multiple exposures over the last 3 years of the US CIA illegally trafficking lethal arms to Al Nusra and other terrorists through covert operations like Timber Sycamore.Still, US and NATO member state officials and their media gatekeepers continue to deny it and play dumb, rather than come clean that the United States and its  partners  in the region are helping, not hindering ISIS terrorism.Some might ask: why would they do a thing like that? By now, the answer should be simple, but threefold:What s so comical yet even more tragic, is how prominent the topic of  ISIS  factors into all of the vapid  national security  debates and media panels in this year s US Presidential election, and in the dumbed-down  coverage of the delusional US mainstream media, led by Pentagon surrogate CNN, and hopeless FOX News. Judging by their prosaic  coverage , neither the networks, nor Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have the slightest clue of what the reality on the ground is. Instead we here,  My ISIS plan is better than yours!  The US political conversation has gone beyond ridiculousness.The corps of US military and CIA media spokesman aren t much better. The sad part is some of them do know what is really happening, but would rather lie to the American public.With so much double dealing, who can you trust? Certainly not anyone in Washington.More on the White House s latest dangerous proposition .RTThe US and Saudi Arabia have agreed to grant free passage to thousands of Islamic State militants before the Iraqi city of Mosul is stormed. The jihadists will be redeployed to fight against the government in Syria, a military-diplomatic source told RIA Novosti. More than 9,000 Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) militants will be redeployed from Mosul to the eastern regions of Syria to carry out a major offensive operation, which involves capturing Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source said.According to the anonymous diplomatic source, US President Barack Obama has already sanctioned an operation to liberate Mosul, due to take place in October.During the storm of the city in northern Iraq the US-led coalition s planes would only strike detached, vacated or uninhabited buildings, while keeping terrorists as targets, he said.In September, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter confirmed that Washington would send an additional 600 troops to Iraq to help liberate Mosul at the request of the local authorities.The source suggested that redeployment of IS militants is necessary because  Washington must somehow counter Russia s achievements in Syria, try to diminish their importance. Apart from the purely political dividends, the other purpose of this operation, obviously, will be to discredit the success of Russian Airspace forces. And, of course, it s an attempt to undermine Syrian President (Bashar) Assad,  he said.The leadership of Saudi Arabia s General Intelligence Directorate will be the mediators and guarantors of the agreement on safe passage for the jihadists from Mosul, he claimed.The source added that a similar scheme had been used by the US and its allies during the liberation of the Iraqi city of Fallujah Continue this story at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 13, 2016"

Jerry Brown signs bill allowing felons to vote from their jail cells pic.twitter.com/6bhKD4hOZJ  FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 29, 2016Despite widespread opposition from law enforcement, Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed a bill that will allow thousands of felons in county jails to vote in California elections as part of an effort to speed their transition back into society.Through a representative, Brown declined to comment on the bill by Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), who said it would reduce the likelihood of convicts committing new crimes. Civic participation can be a critical component of re-entry and has been linked to reduced recidivism,  Weber said when the bill was introduced.On Wednesday, Weber said California is setting an example at a time when other state s are trying to limit voting rights. I wrote AB 2466 because I want to send a message to the nation that California will not stand for discrimination in voting,  Weber said Wednesday after the bill was signed.Sen. Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Niguel) criticized the approval of the legislation, which takes effect Jan. 1.Bates said the new law will undermine the integrity of elections by allowing people in jail to decide close contest. It is very disappointing that felons still serving their sentences behind bars will now be able to vote since Governor Brown failed to veto this really bad bill,  Bates said in a statement.Read more: LA Times",Government News,"Sep 29, 2016"

Murdered Chicago Teen Was Ward Of The State…So Why Did His Mom And Sister Get $5 Million Settlement?,"Absent parent Cashin  in McDonald was the teen who was shot by the Chicago officer 16 times, some while he was apparently incapacitated on the ground. His family, namely his mother and sister were paid $5 million in a settlement from the city. But they were not taking care of him, the city effectively was. He was removed from his home at age 5 and grew up in foster homes. One has to wonder was he removed from the home because of the molestation?CHICAGO (CBS)   Who was Laquan McDonald? CBS 2 s Dorothy Tucker takes a look at his complicated life from the view of educators and family friends.Yolanda Hoskins speaks affectionately about the Laquan McDonald. He was her son s best friend. Happy and just wanted to be around somebody and feel loved,  she said.The 17-year-old she knew liked basketball, tacos and gym shoes, but he also had a troubled past. He was a ward of the state,  she said.  He was molested too. His death at the hands of a Chicago Police officer who s accused of shooting him 16 times prompted Hoskins to join community activists in a call for justice.There have been questions raised about the failure to release the video earlier and some have accused Rahm Emanuel of holding it back to not hinder his election, and paying the family off. The family apparently was shown the video but did not seek to make it public, in fact, said they would prefer it not to be public as  what mother would want to see the execution of her son over and over . As part of the settlement they agreed to keep it confidential.Update:Here s more on the short life of Laquan McDonald.

 College Moves to Fire Christian Professor For Saying Christians And Muslims Worship Same God (VIDEO),"Professor Larycia Alaine Hawkins upset administrators at Wheaton College when she donned a headscarf last month to show solidarity with the Muslim community in the wake of anti-Islamic sentiment across the country. Wheaton College, which touts itself as a Christian school, also had a problem with Hawkins when she said that Muslims and Christians worship the same God, quoting Pope Francis.  In a statement, Wheaton College initiated a termination-for-cause proceeding against Professor Larycia Hawkins on Tuesday, saying Hawkins wouldn t participate in  clarifying conversations  about theological issues.Here is the Facebook post that Wheaton found problematic://  I don t love my Muslim neighbor because s/he is American. I love my Muslim neighbor because s/he deserves love by virtue of her/his human dignity. I stand in human solidarity with my Muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay, descendants of the same cradle of humankind a cave in Sterkfontein, South Africa that I had the privilege to descend into to plumb the depths of our common humanity in 2014. I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God. But as I tell my students, theoretical solidarity is not solidarity at all. Thus, beginning tonight, my solidarity has become embodied solidarity. As part of my Advent Worship, I will wear the hijab to work at Wheaton College, to play in Chi-town, in the airport and on the airplane to my home state that initiated one of the first anti-Sharia laws (read: unconstitutional and Islamophobic), and at church. I invite all women into the narrative that is embodied, hijab-wearing solidarity with our Muslim sisters for whatever reason. A large scale movement of Women in Solidarity with Hijabs is my Christmas  # wish  this year. Perhaps you are a Muslim who does not wear the veil normally. Perhaps you are an atheist or agnostic who finds religion silly or inexplicable. Perhaps you are a Catholic or Protestant Christian like me. Perhaps you already cover your head as part of your religious worship, but not a hijab. I would like to add that I have sought the advice and blessing of one of the preeminent Muslim organizations in the United States, the Council on American Islamic Relations,  # CAIR , where I have a friend and Board colleague on staff. I asked whether a non-Muslim wearing the hijab was haram (forbidden), patronizing, or otherwise offensive to Muslims. I was assured by my friends at CAIR-Chicago that they welcomed the gesture. So please do not fear joining this embodied narrative of actual as opposed to theoretical unity; human solidarity as opposed to mere nationalistic, sentiment. The statement above sends a message of love and tolerance and it s the college that exudes intolerance and Islamophobia by firing this courageous woman. Professors also have the right to academic freedom. One can only imagine the consequences of muzzling professors because they speak about important social issues. One of the most cherished aspects of the American way is the right to freedom of speech. Wheaton College has violated that right by moving to terminate the professor. A petition signed by tens of thousands has been circulating to reinstate the professor.Here is what Illinois Committee A on Academic Freedom had to say about Wheaton s actions: There can be no doubt that Wheaton s attempt to fire a professor for expressing support for Muslims is an attack on academic freedom. But what few have realized is that this bigotry also an attack on the Christian values of loving thy neighbor that Wheaton pretends to embrace. The administration at Wheaton is not just betraying the values of freedom that every true college must stand for, they are also betraying the values of Wheaton College itself. Here is Professor Hawkins  graceful response on the move to terminate her: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRRq3SdcBo] Show your support for Professor Hawkins by signing and sharing this petition.Featured image: screegrab",News,"January 6, 2016"
WOW! RUSSIAN LAWYER Who Met With Donald Trump Jr. Seen In Photo With Person Tied To Obama Only 8 Days After Meeting,"Much to the dismay of mainstream media journalists, Donald Trump Jr. released all email communication regarding his meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya today on Twitter. Meanwhile, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has told NBC News that she met with Donald Trump Jr. to discuss sanctions, that she did not have any Kremlin connections, and that she did not hand over information about Hillary s campaign.She confirmed her meeting with Donald Trump Jr. was about Russian adoptions in the US.But is there more to Natalia Veselnitskaya than meets the eye? Who is she? Does she have ties to Obama and the Democratic Party? Was the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. a set up?According to The Gateway Pundit: The law firm where Veselnitskaya is listed as managing partner, Kamerton Consulting, is based in a Moscow suburb and does not even have a website.A staff member at Kamerton told The Associated Press Veselnitskaya was unavailable for comment on Monday.Her office in Moscow may be a shell. There is no working phone, email or website.Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the Kremlin is unaware of a meeting between Trump s senior staff and Veselnitskaya and  does not know who that is. Peskov said, No, we don t know who that is and obviously we can t monitor all meetings Russian lawyers hold both in Russia and abroad. Now this Natalia Veselnitskaya was sitting with Obama s Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, 8 days after cold-contacting Trump Jr. in Trump Tower.Here s a shot showing who appears to be Natalia Veselnitskaya, sitting behind  from the June 14, 2016 Congressional hearing on Russia and the Ukraine.Natalia Veselnitskaya photo:MORE  That looks like Emin Agalarov sitting next to Natalia Veselnitskaya. He was mentioned in Donald Trump Jr s statement this morning. Emin helped set up the meeting with Veselnitskaya.Veselnitskaya was also connected to Fusion GPS, the DNC opposition research firm that produced the fraudulent and discredited Trump Dossier.So why was Veselnitskaya hanging out with Obama officials just days after her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.?And why was Veselnitskaya given a privileged seat up front during the Congressional hearing?

 Democrats Preparing A Coup To Oust Debbie Wasserman-Schultz,"As the Democratic Primary wraps up and tensions continue to flare, Capitol Hill Democrats are quietly discussing a possible coup to oust DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.Wasserman-Schultz, who has been seen as wildly divisive in the primary, is facing a mountain of criticism and uphill battles as she braces for a tough primary fight in Florida.According to an exclusive, in depth report from The Hill, Democratic Senators have been meeting together to draw up a plan to force the Florida Congresswoman to resign. One Democratic Senator, who is pro-Clinton and who remained anonymous, told The Hill: There have been a lot of meetings over the past 48 hours about what color plate do we deliver Debbie Wasserman-Schultz s head on. I don t see how she can continue to the election. How can she open the convention? Sanders supporters would go nuts. It s worth noting that these Democratic lawmakers couldn t actually oust Wasserman-Schultz; only the National Committee could do that, and would rely on talks between Clinton and Sanders.Another Democratic Senator echoed these sentiments, saying if the party hopes to attract young people, Wasserman-Schultz must go: We need to get this figured out and come together. Hillary s got the nomination. She needs Bernie s energy. It s time for her to accommodate. It s time to pick hard-nosed people to cut through things and figure out a deal. They [young people] need to know this is their party. However, not all Democratic Senators are cooling to Wasserman-Schultz. Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring at the end of this term, said the Congresswoman has done a good job,  and said,  If you look at her platform committee appointments, she really gave a lot of room to Bernie supporters. Senators Bill Nelson, Tim Kaine, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeanne Shaheen, and others have gone on record with The Hill vehemently denying the attempted coup and pledging their support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Chair Xavier Baccara have also expressed their support for the DNC Chairwoman.The only member of he Senate to endorse Sanders, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, has remained neutral, but chastised Wasserman-Schultz for  adding gasoline to the fire  after the contentious and disastrous Nevada convention.An aide to Joe Biden told The Hill that the Vice President supports her.The issue surrounding Debbie Wasserman-Schultz continues to divide Democrats with roughly two months to go until the national convention in Philadelphia.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016"
"FLASHBACK: BERNIE SANDERS’ Socialist Democrat Party Asks, “Why Not Peace With Hitler?” [VIDEO]","If I found out my college-age daughter was attending a Bernie Sanders rally, she would #FeelTheBern when her tuition payments were shut off. And for all of the parents who say  it s just a phase  or  they ll eventually come around,  you re not teaching your kids anything. If your child is out campaigning for a declared Democrat Socialist, whose primary goal it is to take what you ve earned and give it to someone else, you should be ashamed of yourself for providing financial support to your self-absorbed child.We live in the greatest nation on earth. It s hard to even fathom that we have a declared Democrat-Socialist even registering in the polls.  Here s a great flashback video that was taken in NYC in 1941, and posted by Weasel Zippers.  It perfectly illustrates what the pacifist, Socialist Democrat party is all about. Can you imagine what our world would look like today if the majority of Americans took these people seriously?We ve spent the last 7 years watching our President go from nation to nation apologizing for the greatness of America. We don t need another pacifist leading our nation, we need strong leader who will restore our international reputation. We need a President who believes in the greatness of America and will do everything in their power to reverse the damage our current President has done.Make sure you share this video with friends and family.

BUSTED! ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTERS Paid To Stir Up Violence At Trump Events,"Craig s list ads offering to pay protesters $16 to stir up violence at Trump events makes us want to puke! What in the world has free speech come to when Hillary Clinton and George Soros via Moveon.org offer to pay people to stop free speech? Pretty shameful! Soros has his hand in the 2016 election and is funding much of the protests against Trump. The guy is just plain evil!The Daily Caller Reported:The Establishment on both the left and the right, who want to disenfranchise the millions of Republican voters who support Donald Trump, have blamed the staged riots near Trump rallies on Trump or on Bernie Sanders. That s like blaming the Russians for the Reichstag Fire. Bernie has little to do with these manufactured protests. This is a Clinton operation, a faux protest.At #CrushTrump NYC, dancing loons think democracy means chanting and dancing, rather than free speech and voting. pic.twitter.com/6DTibaiSiK  Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 20, 2016False flag operations have long been common in politics, but these riots are poisonous to the electorate, intentionally designed to turn violent and stifle free speech.

It is paid for mostly by George Soros and MoveOn.org and pushed by David Brock at Media Matters for America. It s also funded by reclusive billionaire Jonathan Lewis, who was identified by the Miami New Times as a  mystery man.  He inherited roughly a billion dollars from his father Peter Lewis (founder of Progressive Insurance Company).A march and demonstration against Trump at Trump Tower essentially fizzled Saturday when only 500  protesters  of the promised 5000 showed up. Infiltrating the crowd, I learned most were from MoveOn or the Occupy movement. Soap was definitely in short supply in this crowd. Several admitted answering a Craig s list ad paying $16.00 an hour for protesters.Read more: GP",politics,"Mar 23, 2016"

Firing back at Univision for its refusal to air his Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, the outspoken mogul and GOP presidential candidate has barred anyone who works for Univision from the greens of his Miami golf course.In a letter Friday to Randy Falco, Trump advised the Univision CEO that  under no circumstances is any officer or representative of Univision allowed to use Trump National Doral, Miami   its golf courses or any of its facilities. Trump also demanded that Falco, whose company s Miami office is next door to Trump National Doral,  immediately stop work and close the gate which is being constructed between our respective properties.  Trump gave Falco one week to take care of that matter, or  we will close it. The letter was dispatched a day after Univision declared it was canceling its coverage of the Miss USA pageant July 12 on its UniMas network as well as the Miss Universe pageant, which had been scheduled to air on the flagship Univision channel next January, and was severing its business relationship with the Miss Universe Organization, which produces both pageants. The reason: what Univision called  insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants  recently voiced by Trump, a part owner of Miss Universe.During his presidential campaign kickoff speech last week, Trump had portrayed immigrants from Mexico as  bringing drugs, they re bringing crime, they re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.  He also called for building a wall along the southern border of the U.S. The remarks drew condemnation from the Mexican government as  biased and absurd,  and sparked Univision s announcement.Trump, who has said his criticism was directed against U.S. policymakers, not the Mexican people or its government, stated Thursday that Univision would be defaulting on an ironclad contract if it doesn t air the pageants. He pledged to take legal action against the company.He also accused the New York-based Univision of having ties to Mexico that led the network to submit to pressure from Mexican leaders to punish him for pro-U.S. positions he expresses as a presidential candidate. They don t want me saying that Mexico is killing the United States in trade and killing the United States at the border,  Trump had said.In a P.S. to his letter, which was addressed to Univision s Manhattan headquarters, Trump continued on that track.  Please congratulate your Mexican Government officials for having made such outstanding trade deals with the United States,  he wrote Falco.  However, inform them that should I become President, those days are over. We are bringing jobs back to the U.S. Also, a meaningful border will be immediately created, not the laughingstock that currently exists. The letter was signed,  Sincerely, Donald J. Trump. When asked for comment on Trump s letter, Univision seemed to be treating it as par for the course.A memo to Univision management on Thursday directed that, as part of the company s decision to cut ties with Miss Universe, employees  should not stay at Trump properties while on company business or hold events/activities there.

‘A DELIRIUM IS SPREADING’ – The Left’s Great Russian Conspiracy Theory," The very people who for years talked about the problem of conspiracy theories have become the keenest spreaders of conspiracy theories. The people who spent the past few months banging on about the  post-truth  politics of Brexit and Trump have shown they don t have the first clue what truth is. The people who posed as champions of logic have revealed themselves as peddlers of paranoia  21st Century Wire says During last year s the election cycle, 21WIRE called-out the liberal establishment s whole  Russian Hack  conspiracy as a  hoax,  but even conservative media were too shy to go that far in condemning what is obviously one of the biggest put-ups in modern political history.As veteran journalist Robert Parry said this week on ACR s Patrick Henningsen LIVE show this past week, a madness  has set-in in Washington and throughout progressive liberal enclaves throughout America, as the opposition still clings to the desperate hope that some actual evidence to support their conspiracies theories about Trump and Russia will somehow manifest and provide a short-cut to his ouster.Hillary Clinton s internationalist tribe, American and European progressive left, is at the precipice  an entire block of society who may have lost their minds   and who could end up committed in a political bardo.Finally, some mainstream publications are beginning to come around to call it what it is, and that s much welcome.As they say, always better late than never Brendan O Neil Spectator The chattering classes have officially lost it. On both sides of the Atlantic.Of course they d been teetering on the cliff edge of sanity for a while, following the bruising of their beloved EU by 17m angry Brits and Hillary s loss to that orange muppet they thought no one except rednecks would vote for. But now they ve gone over. They re falling fast. They re speeding away from the world of logic into a cesspit of conspiracy and fear. It s tragic. Or hilarious. One or the other.Exhibit A: this week s New Yorker. It s mad. It captures wonderfully how the liberal-left has come to be polluted by the paranoid style of McCarthyist thinking since Trump s victory. It s a New Yorker for a future, dystopian America that s been captured by the Evil Empire. The mag s masthead is in Cyrillic and its famous dandy mascot   Eustace Tilley   has morphed into Putin.

A 13,000-word report,  Trump, Putin and the New Cold War,  is accompanied by a drawing of a deep-red, UFO-style Kremlin hovering over the White House and firing lasers into it. It s CGI Hollywood meets House Un-American Activities in an orgy of liberal dread over Ruskies ruining the nation.It used to be right-wingers who fretted over Russians and Reds and pinkos colonising Westerners  lives and minds. Now it s lefties. Trump is regularly called Putin s puppet. He s an unwitting agent  of Moscow, we re told. The New York Times even called him The Siberian Candidate, echoing the title of the 1962 thriller The Manchurian Candidate, in which an American is brainwashed by Korean Communists to become an assassin. That s how some seriously view Trump: a Putin-moulded foot soldier of Russian interests who ll assassinate the American way of life, if not American citizens. I mean, Vanity Fair actually asks:  Is Trump a Manchurian Candidate?  These people need a lie down. You have to get deep into the  New Yorker s prolix report to discover that US officials still haven t provided evidence for their claim that Putin ordered the hacking of Democrat emails in order to hurry Trump to power:  The declassified report [on Putin s meddling] provides more assertion than evidence. But that hasn t stopped the left McCarthyists, these Reds on the Web fearmongers, from buying into all kinds of claptrap about Putin putting Trump in the White House.In December, a YouGov survey of Democratic voters found that 50 percent of them think  Russia tampered with vote tallies to help Trump.  That is, White House-eyeing Putinites actually meddled with voting machines or ballot counts. There s no evidence whatever for this. In YouGov s words, it s an  election day conspiracy theory.

 WATCH: Chris Mathews DESTROYS Trump Surrogate Who Says Clinton Started Birther Movement,"During an interview on MSNBC s Hardball with Chris Mathews on Friday, Trump surrogate Jack Kingston claimed that Hillary Clinton was the person who started the birther movement. Mathews did not hold back when he pressed Kingston on the accusation that is, frankly, as absurd as the claim the birther movement originally put forth.Already sounding a bit peeved at the assertion, Mathews asks Kingston,  Where did you see this? Kingston claims that he saw an inter-party email from 2008 that was put out by the Clinton campaign: From the Clinton campaign itself? You ve seen this? Kingston says that he has seen a copy of the e-mail. No, you can t say Hillary Clinton is the mother of the birther movement and not have evidence,  Mathews says.  You knew you were coming on the show, why didn t you bring it with you? I may even have it my briefcase, Chris I don t know. Mathews tells Kingston that the show is live and they have enough time for him to find it if it is. This is a live show. We ve got an hour. Find it. Congressman, dead serious, if you can find something from the Clinton campaign   not some blogger out there   but somebody who actually worked for Hillary Clinton under her direction who said that the president wasn t born in this country that would be news. If you can produce it Now, of course, Kingston cannot produce any evidence because it is a lie. Should such an e-mail exist, it wouldn t just be news, it would be a bombshell that would severely cripple the Democratic Party. It probably would not convince many Democrats to start buying red hats and voting for Trump, though it would certainly make even her most die-hard supporters cringe.Kingston is merely trying to deflect from the fact that Trump still has not apologized for perpetuating the birther conspiracy theory. The allegations that Trump put forth about President Obama during the early years of Obama s administration were Trump s first foray into the political spotlight. His allegations were what built his base of radical right-wing conservatives. He cannot apologize for fear of alienating that base of supporters.Trump would love for most of the world to forget that he ever was a birther. We won t. It s important. No matter how many surrogates Trump s campaign throws out there to try and change the narrative surrounding the controversy, we won t forget.You can watch the interview below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ISJaqJt_VMFeatured image from video screenshot",News,"September 10, 2016"
Deputy Attorney General Doubles Down On Comey Memo: “I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.”,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein doubled down today when he told Congress he stands by a memo he wrote that the White House has cited as a justification for the firing last week of FBI Director James Comey.In closed-door meetings with lawmakers on Thursday and Friday, Rosenstein said he wrote the memo after President Donald Trump told him one day before the May 9 firing that he wanted to dismiss Comey. He said that though he was personally fond of Comey,  I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader. The Justice Department on Friday issued a transcript of Rosenstein s remarks:OPENING STATEMENT:Good afternoon. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my role in the removal of FBI Director James Comey, although I know you understand that I will not discuss the special counsel s ongoing investigation. Most importantly, I want to emphasize my unshakeable commitment to protecting the integrity of every federal criminal investigation. There never has been, and never will be, any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the United States Department of Justice.Before I discuss the events of the past two weeks, I want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former Director Comey. I have known Jim Comey since approximately 2002. In 2005, when Mr. Comey was Deputy Attorney General, he participated in selecting me to serve as a U.S. Attorney. As a federal prosecutor, he was a role model. His speeches about leadership and public service inspired me.On July 5, 2016, Director Comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of Secretary Clinton s emails. At the start of the press conference, the Director stated that he had  not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice . They do not know what I am about to say. Director Comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose  what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice.  He proceeded to disclose details about the evidence; assert that the American people  deserve  to know details; declare that no  reasonable  prosecutor would file charges; and criticize Secretary Clinton.I thought the July 5 press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the Department of Justice and Secretary Clinton. It explicitly usurped the role of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and the entire Department of Justice; it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions; and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.There are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized. Such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors, and protect the rights of citizens.Director Comey attended the Maryland U.S. Attorney s Office training seminar on October 27, 2016, and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his analysis, but I believe that he made his decisions in good faith.The next day, October 28, Mr. Comey sent his letter to the Congress announcing that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation. He subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter. I completely disagree. He again usurped the authority of the Department of Justice, by sending the letter over the objection of the Department of Justice; flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions; and guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.Before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, Director Comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his explanations, particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment. Nonetheless, I respected him personally.Former Department of Justice officials from both political parties have criticized Director Comey s decisions. It was not just an isolated mistake; the series of public statements about the email investigation, in my opinion, departed from the proper role of the FBI Director and damaged public confidence in the Bureau and the Department.In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI. Among the concerns that I recall were to restore the credibility of the FBI, respect the established authority of the Department of Justice, limit public statements and eliminate leaks.On May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader.I wrote a brief memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my longstanding concerns about Director Comey s public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation.I chose the issues to include in my memorandum.Before finalizing the memorandum on May 9, I asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it. That attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General during multiple administrations. He was familiar with the issues. I informed the senior attorney that the President was going to remove Director Comey, that I was writing a memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my own concerns, and that I wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate. He concurred with the points raised in my memorandum. I also asked several other career Department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits.My memorandum is not a legal brief; these are not issues of law.My memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct; the Inspector General will render his judgment about that issue in due course.My memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination.My memorandum is not a survey of FBI morale or performance.My memorandum is not a press release.It is a candid internal memorandum about the FBI Director s public statements concerning a high-profile criminal investigation.I sent my signed memorandum to the Attorney General after noon on Tuesday, May 9.I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.Finally, I want to address the media claims that the FBI asked for additional resources for the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. I am not aware of any such request. Moreover, I consulted my staff and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and none of them recalls such a request.END OF TRANSCRIPTThe White House has struggled since Comey s firing to explain the chain of events that led to it and who exactly made the decision. Trump said as recently as Thursday that he acted on a  very strong  recommendation from Rosenstein, but Rosenstein made it clear to Congress that he drafted his memo only after Trump told him of his plans to dismiss the FBI director.He said he did not intend for the document to be a finding of misconduct or a  statement of reasons  to justify the firing, but he added:  I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it. Via: NBC Chicago",politics,"May 19, 2017"

EXPOSED: REASON FOX NEWS Doesn’t Want Donald Trump On The Debate Stage… And Which Candidate They’re Pushing For,"Julia Hahn is a young, brilliant reporter with Breitbart News. She already has a reputation for fearlessly exposing corruption on both sides of the aisle. Julia does a brilliant job of exposing the truth about why FOX News will likely not be too disappointed that Trump has declined to appear on their upcoming debate. There are few news outlets that conservatives can turn to for the truth. This piece is disappointing because I, like many others have been relying on FOX News for years for unbiased reporting. When it comes to the truth about illegal immigration and amnesty, we need to keep a closer eye on FOX News, who appears to be no different than the rest of the networks when it comes to the invasion of our nation by illegals and Muslim refugees The announcement from Donald Trump s campaign that the Republican frontrunner will  definitely not  partake in Thursday night s Fox News debate has sent shock waves throughout the nation s political scene.At a press event Tuesday evening, Trump seemed to cite disparate treatment from the network as his reasoning for not participating.  What s wrong over there, something s wrong,  Trump said of the  games  Roger Ailes and the network are  playing. In asking the question of  what s wrong over there?  Trump has shined a spotlight on one of Washington s best kept secrets: namely, Fox s role via its founder Rupert Murdoch in pushing an open borders agenda. The Trump campaign is a direct threat to Murdoch s efforts to open America s borders. Well-concealed from virtually all reporting on Fox s treatment of Trump is the fact that Murdoch is the co-chair of what is arguably one of the most powerful immigration lobbying firms in country, the Partnership for a New American Economy (PNAE).In addition to blanketing the country, media, and politicians with literature, advertisements, and a barrage of lobbyists pushing for open border immigration policies, the Partnership for A New American Economy (PNAE) was a prime lobbyist for one of the biggest open borders pushes in American history: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) 2013 Gang of Eight immigration bill.While Donald Trump has pledged to deport those illegally residing in the country and temporarily pause Muslim migration, Rubio s immigration bill would have granted immediate amnesty and eventual citizenship to millions of illegal aliens, it would have doubled the annual admission of foreign workers, and it would have dispensed 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade despite current record immigration levels.While Megyn Kelly made headlines with her heated questioning of Donald Trump, not one of the Fox News anchors asked Rubio in the first Fox News debate about his signature piece of legislation, which Murdoch s immigration lobbying firm had endorsed. Instead, they lobbed Rubio a series of softballs, such as asking Rubio if he could put God and veterans in the same sentence.Interestingly, Bill Sammon   FOX News s vice president of News and Washington managing editor   is the father of Brooke Sammon, who is Rubio s press secretary.As Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told The New Yorker s Ryan Lizza back in 2013, Fox News was essential to the Rubio-Schumer effort to expand immigration levels beyond all known historical precedent. As Lizza wrote at the time:McCain told me,  Rupert Murdoch is a strong supporter of immigration reform, and Roger Ailes is, too.  Murdoch is the chairman and C.E.O. of News Corp., which owns Fox, and Ailes is Fox News s president. McCain said that he, [Lindsey] Graham, [Marco] Rubio, and others also have talked privately to top hosts at Fox, including Bill O Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Neil Cavuto   God bless Fox,  Graham said.  Last time [i.e. during the 2007 immigration push], it was  amnesty  every fifteen seconds.  He said that the change was important for his reelection, because  eighty per cent of people in my primary get their news from Fox.  He added that the network has  allowed critics to come forward, but it s been so much better. Murdoch s support of open borders immigration policies has been identified as a potential conflict of interest for years. As ABC reported in 2013:Murdoch, Australian born and a naturalized U.S. citizen, has become an outspoken advocate for immigration reform and mass legalization of the country s undocumented immigrants, partnering with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in this cause. Whether Murdoch s personal views will percolate through his network, or at least temper criticism on the airwaves of those who don t share it, remains to be seen.In 2013, during the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight push, Mickey Kaus similarly pointed out:In 2007, John McCain s  comprehensive  immigrant-legalization bill failed after opponents flooded the Senate with calls, shutting down the switchboard  It won t be that easy this time  The GOP donor class is asserting itself  One of the more influential members of this  donorist  class is Rupert Murdoch, which means that FOX News has for all intents and purposes switched sides, giving immigration  comprehensivists  a monopoly in the MSM five networks to none.Indeed, Murdoch has himself expressed his support for large-scale immigration. In a 2014 op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal s open borders opinion pages, titled,  Immigration Reform Can t Wait,  Murdoch wrote:When I learned that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had lost his Republican primary, my heart sank. Not simply because I think he is an intelligent and talented member of Congress, or because I worry about the future of the Republican Party. Like others who want comprehensive immigration reform, I worried that Mr. Cantor s loss would be misconstrued and make Congress reluctant to tackle this urgent need. That would be the wrong lesson and an undesirable national consequence of this single, local election result.In his Wall Street Journal op-ed, Murdoch echoed Rubio s position on granting citizenship to illegal immigrants. Murdoch wrote,  We need to give those individuals who are already here  a path to citizenship.  Murdoch even decried Americans who opposed amnesty as,  nativists who scream about amnesty    a statement which is perhaps even more significant given the fact that Murdoch is himself a beneficiary of the nation s generous immigration policy.Murdoch praised President Obama for showing  wise restraint  on immigration, even though, at the time of Murdoch s writing, Obama had already implemented his first unconstitutional executive amnesty, giving away American jobs to illegal aliens   including the jobs of black Americans whose have suffered some of the greatest harms from mass immigration.When asked about the president s unconstitutional 2012 executive amnesty, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA], Marco Rubio has said that, if he is elected president, he  wouldn t undo it immediately.  This was another statement of Rubio s which the Fox News anchors utterly failed to probe in their first debate to which they came loaded with questions for Trump, who   unlike Rubio   had not pushed an immigration plan backed by the network s founder.Murdoch also called for an unlimited number of foreign workers to fill coveted tech jobs through the H-1B visa program, which experts have described as an  indentured servitude  program:We need to do away with the cap on H-1B visas, which is arbitrary and results in U.S. companies struggling to find the high-skill workers they need to continue growing. We already know that most of the applications for these visas are for computer programmers and engineers, where there is a shortage of qualified American candidates.Contrary to Mr. Murdoch s assertions, there are more than 11 million Americans with degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) who lack employment in these fields, and U.S. schools are graduating two times more students with STEM degrees than are annually finding employment in these fields.FOR ENTIRE STORY: Julia Hahn, Breitbart News ",politics,"Jan 27, 2016"
 Congressional Black Caucus Formulates Battle Plan For Trump Resistance,"Despite claims to the contrary, Donald Trump has made it crystal clear that he is no friend to minorities. But members of the Congressional Black Caucus intend to fight him tooth and nail to protect people of color. As such, they have formulated a battle plan to resist policies that may be harmful to these communities The stakes are incredibly high and our community is counting on us as the last line of defense between Donald Trump and the worst of what America could offer,  Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said.Throughout his campaign, Trump proposed policies targeting specific minority groups, such as banning all Muslims from entering the U.S. and building a wall to keep out all the rapey Mexicans. He was also the champion of the  birther  movement, which was nothing more than a racially motivated attack on the country s first African-American president. The campaign that we saw over the last 12 months is very frightening. And there s been no effort on his part to even temper his comments since being elected,  said outgoing CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.).  It s going to be very contentious, I suspect, if Mr. Trump even follows through on half of his promises during the campaign. Incoming CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.) plans to lay out the CBC s plan in more detail when he officially takes office on Tuesday. But he says that the people Trump has appointed to his cabinet are highly concerning. We speak for vulnerable people, we speak for the disenfranchised   and we take that seriously,  Richmond said.  And those appointments seem to be tone-deaf to sensitivity and to, I think, just common sense. At the top of the worrisome list of cabinet appointments are Alabama senator and open racist Jeff Sessions, who is Trump s attorney general pick, and alt-right hero and former Breitbart bigwig, Steve Bannon, Trump s senior adviser. The appointments should concern not just minorities but all Americans,  said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).  When you look at Sessions, I mean he doesn t have the most stellar reputation for civil rights and voting rights. It s rough. Members of the CBC note that this is a first. Having a battle plan to resist the racist policies of an incoming president is hardly business as usual. This is not the normal incoming president,  added Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.).  We had no plan for George Bush. I think Charlie Rangel and John Conyers would tell you they didn t even have a plan for Richard Nixon. But this is not the norm.

BREAKING: FL MUSLIM TERRORIST Worked For Security Company Who Quietly Transports And RELEASES Van Loads Of ILLEGAL ALIENS Away From Border For U.S. Government,"As a side note, the illegal aliens who are being dropped off across America in vans are OTM s or Other Than Mexicans. Can the mainstream media PLEASE start doing their job and exposing this corrupt administration? In a surprising discovery, the Palm Beach Post first reported that according to state records, Orlando shooter Omar Mateen   who as we reported earlier was licensed as a security guard and also holds a firearms license   was employed by the US subsidiary of G4S plc, a British multinational security services company, whose US-headquarters are located in Jupiter, Fla, and which also happens to be the world s largest security company by revenue.Shortly thereafter, G4S confirmed that Omar Mateen has worked for the company since 2007. This is the statement released from G4S: We are shocked and saddened by the tragic event that occurred at the Orlando nightclub. We can confirm that Omar Mateen had been employed with G4S since September 10, 2007. We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends, families and people affected by this unspeakable tragedy.  In other words, Mateen who according to preliminary reports, had been on a terrorist watchlist, and who still managed to obtain weapons thanks to his various licenses and permits just last week, was employed by one of the world s largest security companies, where he may have had extensive clearances well above his pay grade, not to mention access to sophisticated military weapons and equipment.But where it gets more disturbing is that as Judicial Watch reported several days ago, in a post titled,  DHS Quietly Moving, Releasing Vanloads Of Illegal Aliens Away From Border , border patrol sources said that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was quietly transporting illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing them without proper processing or issuing court appearance documents. As a reminder, the government classifies them as Other Than Mexican (OTM) and this week around 35 were transferred 116 miles north from Tucson to a Phoenix bus station where they went their separate way. Judicial Watch was present when one of the white vans carrying a group of OTMs arrived at the Phoenix Greyhound station on Buckeye Road.And this is where the Mateen-G4S link emerges: as JW reported previously, a security company contracted by the U.S. government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix, sources said. The firm is the abovementioned G4S, the world s leading security solutions group with operations in more than 100 countries and 610,000 employees. G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the U.S. and its domestic headquarters is in Jupiter, Florida.Judicial Watch noted that it had filed a number of public records requests to get more information involving the arrangement between G4S and the government, specifically the transport of illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to other parts of the country. The photo below shows the uniformed G4S guard that transported the OTMs this week from Tucson to Phoenix.Outraged Border Patrol agents and supervisors on the front lines say illegal immigrants are being released in droves because there s no room to keep them in detention.  They re telling us to put them on a bus and let them go,  said one law enforcement official in Arizona.  Just move those bodies across the country.  Officially, DHS denies this is occurring and in fact earlier this year U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske blasted Border Patrol union officials for denouncing this dangerous catch-and-release policy. Kerlikowske s scolding came in response to the congressional testimony of Bandon Judd, chief of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union that represents line agents. Judd told lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee that illegal immigrants without serious criminal convictions can be released immediately and disappear into the shadows. Kerlikowske shot back, telling a separate congressional committee:  I would not stand by if the Border Patrol was   releasing people without going through all of the formalities.Meanwhile, the Hill reported that Mateen s employment, and gun licenses, were untouched even though the FBI confirmed it had interviewed the 29-year-old three times before the shooting took place early Sunday morning. An official said that the FBI first became aware of the suspect, Omar Mateen, 29, in 2013 when he made  inflammatory comments to coworkers alleging possible terrorist ties. In the course of that investigation, Mateen was interviewed twice, but the FBI was unable to verify the substance of his comments. Via: Zero HedgeShares in G4S have fallen heavily after the UK security services company said Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was an employee.G4S said Mateen was an armed security officer and that it was trying to establish whether weapons used in the attack on the Pulse gay nightclub were related to his work. The company supplies its armed employees with guns in the US and does not allow them to use their own.G4S shares dropped by as much as 7.5% and were the biggest fallers among leading UK shares. The company employs 620,000 people in more than 110 countries and the US is one of its biggest markets.Jasper Lawler, an analyst at CMC Markets, a City spread betting firm, said it did not look good for G4S to have employed Mateen while he was being investigated by the FBI. G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the US, a large proportion of which are involved in government contracts. If the name of G4S starts getting dragged through the mud, US contracts may become harder to come by.  Via: Guardian",politics,"Jun 13, 2016"

WOW! WHAT HAPPENED When Somebody Asked Beyonce’s Racist Sister To Sit Down At A Concert?,"Who knew, that one of the wealthiest entertainers in America and the New Black Panthers biggest cheerleader, has a sister who is also a perpetual victim of racism? When she s not beating the shit out of her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator, Solange Knowles is a professional victim of racism. Beyonc s crazier less talented sister recently attended a concert, as a fan not as a performer, and wouldn t you know it, racism reared it s ugly head. Apparently someone asked her to sit down and since she is black, it was a hostile act of racial aggression.If you have nothing better to do, and haven t already witnessed the circus that ensues when a celebrity husband cheats on his celebrity wife with another woman, forcing the sister to even the score in an elevator, you can watch it here:Back to the Solange and her racist manifesto, where she goes to great lengths to explain the racism she encounters in just about every aspect of her life, like the time she got pulled over or the other time she had to show her passport crossing an international border. She describes the perpetrators of racism as,  a product of their white supremacy and are exercising it on you without caution, care, or thought. The main point of this crazy thing was what happened to her at a recent concert. It s written from a weird 2nd person perspective, but this is what I was able to figure out:Solange took her 11-year-old son to a Kraftwerk concert. They arrived late, despite Solange s claim that she is a big fan. Right off the bat an elderly black usher had to tell her son to stop vaping. Solange claims her young son was not vaping, so therefore it was racism.It gets worse. Solange was standing up and dancing when someone behind her asked her to sit down. She refused to sit and eventually someone threw a slice of lime at her. Again: racism. She turned around to confront whoever threw the lime but nobody s white privilege would let them admit to it. For the third time, she experienced racism.Granted, this is a one-sided explanation of things. It s entirely possible that Solange was being rude and obnoxious and the people behind her gave her a gentile reminder to behave herself in public. Then again, maybe none of this stuff even happened.The crazy level rises significantly when Solange tries to put her harrowing experience in perspective by saying:You constantly see the media having a hard time contextualizing black women and men as victims every day, even when it means losing their own lives.Shit, can you believe she almost died in this racist lime attack?She then says that she isn t claiming this incident was racism, even though she said it many times, and chides the media for potentially reporting it that way, followed immediately by this:This is why many black people are uncomfortable being in predominately white spacesFrom there Solange rants about all of the racism in America and ends with the odd statement that she has  many white friends.  You know, to prove she doesn t hate white people or something.Via:  Downtrend",left-news,"Sep 14, 2016"

OBAMA’S CHIEF OF STAFF WARNS AMERICA…He’s Not Going Away Quietly: Promises “Audacious Executive Actions” Including Gun Control,"The big question is who, in Congress has the will to stop him? Keep your notepads handy America, and start keeping track of who you will and won t re-elect in 2016.White House chief of staff Denis McDonough pushed back against the notion his president is played out in the wake of his last State of the Union address, promising  audacious executive action  in Barack Obama s final year in office.During a breakfast with reporters in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, McDonough responded to the observation that the president s final speech before Congress lacked the usual pledge to  go it alone  if lawmakers failed to act.Coupled with the feeble executive actions on gun control announced earlier this month, had President Obama rethought the utility of acting unilaterally on issues important to the White House?  We ll do audacious executive action over the course of the rest of the year, I m confident of that,  said McDonough, explaining that President Obama s decision not to outline specific executive actions was more about a commitment to process than a lack of willpower. Process is your friend, but process also dictates what you can do,  McDonough said.  And we do want to make sure that the executive actions we undertake are not left hanging out there, subject to Congress undoing them. In addition to gun control, the White House has expressed interest in further unilateral actions on immigration reform, and in working around Congress to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay. But McDonough said the White House is considering executive action on any and all issues, and that the main question President Obama plans to ask himself is  Why not?   And so that s the spirit through which we ll approach this last year,  McDonough said.Via: National Review",Government News,"Feb 5, 2016"
Google is the Engine of Censorship,"21st Century Wire says Late last year, search engine giant Google announced its plans to protect users from the horrors of  fake news  by changing the way it presents search results. According to corporate officials, they hope to shelter  readers by limiting access to what the company deems as  low-quality  information   while promoting what it calls  established  mainstream sources. Critics believe that the company, which now has a virtual monopoly on internet traffic, is now playing god over the info-sphere. While its known that Eric Schmidt, the head of Google s parent company, Alphabet Inc, is regular attendee at the annual secretive Bilderberg meeting which charters the globalist agenda, not much is known about new Google CEO Sundar Pichai and what his personal ideology is, or whether he personally believes that Google s role is to control what the public think about any given issue by fixing the search results on the world s number one search engine. Judging by the culture of conformity at Google, it s not likely that Pichai would be allowed to express any dissenting views if he had them.As 21WIRE pointed out last week regarding the controversy over the recent Google Memo and the firm dismissing employees who are seen to divert from the company s prescribed group think, this same repressive political culture at Google is reflected in its broad new automated censorship program administered by algorithms on its Google search engine   a bold move which effectively disappears political views and articles it does not like, and wishes to bury.Watch this segment from RT America, with guest Andre Damon, editor of the World Socialist Web Site, to explain why he believes his site and other alternative sources are being unfairly targeted in Google s new reordering of visible information through its portal.

" Roy Moore Wants To Be Alabama’s Senator, But He Can’t Stop Being A Giant Racist","The name sounds familiar, right? Here s why: He used to be Judge Roy Moore, that one guy from The Dukes of Hazzard. Roscoe, you get them Duke Boys in here now! No, wait.Oh, that s right   He was Chief Justice Roy Moore, of the Alabama Supreme Court. Remember the dude back in 2003 who refused to remove the monument of the Ten Commandments from the grounds of the courthouse? That s him. He s one of just a handful of judges who have ever been removed from office in this country by a judicial panel. Funny enough, he got re-elected to the position a decade later, but got smacked down again, this time because he told Alabama judges to ignore the Supreme Court and continue turning away same-sex marriage license applicants.Now Ol  Roy wants to serve in the Yoo-nited States Senate, taking the place of Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who vacated his Senate seat after his appointment to the Department of Justice.The problem is, like the guy before him (who shares a namesake with that guy in the white hat), Roy Moore is an unrepentant racist. I m pretty sure when Roy kicks the proverbial bucket, his headstone is going to read  Jesus Christ Was A White Man. So it was with no small amount of suppressed horror that the world watched the Formerly-Honorable Roy Moore call Native Americans and Asians  reds and yellows  at a campaign event on Sunday: We know that we were torn apart in the Civil War.

 Even Trump’s Homeland Security Chief Thinks He’s Full Of Sh*t About The Border Wall,"While campaigning, Donald Trump vowed to build a  great wall  and Mexico will pay for it.  I will build a great wall   and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me   and I ll build them very inexpensively,  the former reality show star said at the time.  I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.  Well, that s not going to happen. Mexico is not paying for the wall and Trump s own homeland security secretary disagrees with the amateur president.Kelly said Wednesday that it is doubtful that a wall along the full border with Mexico would ever be built, despite Trump s claims. It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,  Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee, according to The New York Times.Instead, Kelly, who was appointed by Trump said the department will look to build physical barriers. That includes fencing and concrete walls in places that make sense.Like his presidency and administration, Trump s plan for the  great wall  is amateurish and chaotic.In February, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a border-state Republican, said that building a physical wall along the border in some places  makes no sense. There are other Republicans who were left scratching their heads, too, over Trump s nonsensical border wall.  I don t think we re just going to be able to solve border security with a physical barrier because people can come under, around it and through it,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said in January.Still yet, Kelly defended Trump s  extreme vetting  proposal in which he insists that children would not be routinely separated from their families unless the  situation at the time requires it,  such as when the mother is sick or addicted to drugs. Right, because if a mother is sick, her children should be taken from her, amirite?It s not just elected officials who are wondering what the hell Trump is thinking. A supporter of the alleged president s found her home suddenly on the Mexico side of the border. We call that karma. Adding to that, Trump wants a 30-foot wall that looks good on the northern side of the border. We re not sure what she was thinking when she cast her vote for Trump. He was very clear in what he said, and as far as his lies go, she was warned by Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Trump s Republican rivals that he s full of sh*t.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"

We find Manny Pacquiao s comments abhorrent,  Nike said Wednesday in a statement.  Nike strongly opposes discrimination of any kind and has a long history of supporting and standing up for the rights of the LGBT community. Pacquiao, 37, made the incendiary comments in a television interview that ran Monday in his native Philippines. He s currently a member of the House of Representatives and is running for the country s senate.Pacquiao didn t immediately back down hours after the interview aired. Pacquiao said on his Facebook page he was  just telling the truth of what the Bible says. But as the furor grew, Pacquiao posted an apology of sorts on Facebook on Tuesday. I m sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals,  Pacquiao wrote.  Please forgive me for those I ve hurt. I still stand on my belief that I m against same sex marriage because of what the Bible says, but I m not condemning LGBT. I love you all with the love of the Lord. God Bless you all and I m praying for you. Pacquiao also served as a pitchman for Wonderful Pistachios and Nestle, although representatives for both companies said they don t have him under contract currently. Wonderful Pistachios is not currently affiliated with Manny Pacquiao nor do his views align with ours,  Wonderful Pistachios spokesperson Jennifer George told USA TODAY Sports.  Wonderful Pistachios stands firmly for diversity and equality and we proudly support marriage equality and inclusion around the world. ",left-news,"Feb 17, 2016"

GEORGE W. BUSH BREAKS SILENCE: No More “Mr. Nice Guy”…Hammers Obama,"Long overdue In a closed-door meeting with Jewish Donors Saturday night, former President George W. Bush delivered his harshest public criticisms to date against his successor on foreign policy, saying that President Barack Obama is being na ve about Iran and the pending nuclear deal and losing the war against the Islamic State.One attendee at the Republican Jewish Coalition session, held at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas with owner Sheldon Adelson in attendance, transcribed large portions of Bush s remarks. The former president, who rarely ever criticizes Obama in public, at first remarked that the idea of re-entering the political arena was something he didn t want to do. He then proceeded to explain why Obama, in his view, was placing the U.S. in  retreat  around the world. He also said Obama was misreading Iran s intentions while relaxing sanctions on Tehran too easily.According to the attendee s transcription, Bush noted that Iran has a new president, Hassan Rouhani.  He s smooth,  Bush said.  And you ve got to ask yourself, is there a new policy or did they just change the spokesman? Bush said that Obama s plan to lift sanctions on Iran with a promise that they could snap back in place at any time was not plausible. He also said the deal would be bad for American national security in the long term:  You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That s how Americans should view the deal. Bush then went into a detailed criticism of Obama s policies in fighting the Islamic State and dealing with the chaos in Iraq. On Obama s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops in Iraq at the end of 2011, he quoted Senator Lindsey Graham calling it a  strategic blunder.  Bush signed an agreement with the Iraqi government to withdraw those troops, but the idea had been to negotiate a new status of forces agreement to keep U.S. forces there past 2011. The Obama administration tried and failed to negotiate such an agreement.Bush said he views the rise of the Islamic State as al-Qaeda s  second act  and that they may have changed the name but that murdering innocents is still the favored tactic. He defended his own administration s handling of terrorism, noting that the terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who confessed to killing Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, was captured on his watch:  Just remember the guy who slit Danny Pearl s throat is in Gitmo, and now they re doing it on TV. Obama promised to degrade and destroy Islamic State s forces but then didn t develop a strategy to complete the mission, Bush said. He said that if you have a military goal and you mean it,  you call in your military and say  What s your plan?    He indirectly touted his own decision to surge troops to Iraq in 2007, by saying,  When the plan wasn t working in Iraq, we changed. In order to be an effective president   when you say something you have to mean it,  he said.  You gotta kill em. Bush told several anecdotes about his old friend and rival Russian President Vladimir Putin. Bush recalled that Putin met his dog Barney at the White House and then later, when Bush went to Moscow, Putin showed him his dog and remarked that he was  bigger stronger and faster than Barney.  For Bush, that behavior showed him that Putin didn t think in  win-win  terms.Bush also remarked that Putin was rich, divorced his wife and loves power. Putin s domestic popularity comes from his control of Russian media, according to Bush.  Hell, I d be popular, too, if I owned NBC news,  he said.Regarding his brother Jeb s potential run for the presidency, Bush acknowledged that he was a political liability for Jeb, that the Bush name can be used against him, and that American s don t like dynasties. He also said that foreign policy is going to be especially important in the presidential campaign and that the test for Republicans running will be who has got the  courage  to resist isolationist tendencies.Regarding Hillary Clinton, Bush said it will be crucial how she plays her relationship with the president. She will eventually have to choose between running on the Obama administration s policies or running against them. If she defends them, she s admitting failure, he said, but if she doesn t she s blaming the president.For George W. Bush, the remarks in Vegas showed he has little respect for how the current president is running the world. He also revealed that he takes little responsibility for the policies that he put in place that contributed to the current state of affairs.Via: Bloomberg View",politics,"Apr 26, 2015"
 WATCH: Trump Campaign Spokeswoman Says President Obama Started The War In Afghanistan,"Trump s team is taking historical revisionism to a whole new level.During an appearance on CNN with Victor Blackwell, Donald Trump s mouthpiece Katrina Pierson claimed that President Obama is responsible for creating ISIS because he invaded Afghanistan. If you want to go way back, we can look at the troop surge,  Pierson said.  And after 2007, al Qaeda was essentially in ashes. It was Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton who then destroyed the entire rollout by wanting to pull out early, announcing their plans, ignoring intelligence and that s the reason why ISIS is a global issue and not a  A confused Blackwell interrupted.  Barack Obama in 2004, is that what you said?  he asked.And Pierson s rant just got even more confusing. No,  Pierson responded.  I said afterwards. After the surge when al Qaeda was in ashes. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton   remember we weren t even in Afghanistan by this time. Barack Obama went into Afghanistan creating another problem. It was Hillary Clinton and her incidents in Libya. They armed the rebels and funded them. Blackwell gave Pierson another chance to get her facts straight but she only continued trying to rewrite American history.BLACKWELL:  You re saying Barack Obama took the country into Afghanistan post-2009. Is that what you re saying? PIERSON:  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton   that was Obama s war, yes. Here s the video via YouTube:Of course, Pierson is absolutely wrong.The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 during George W. Bush s first year as president. President Obama took office in 2009 and inherited the War in Afghanistan.So if we go by Pierson s logic, that means George W. Bush and Republicans are responsible for the rise of ISIS because they were the ones who took America into Afghanistan.This isn t the first time Pierson has blamed President Obama for a war started by Bush.Earlier this month, Pierson falsely claimed that President Obama is responsible for the death of Captain Humayun Khan, who sacrificed his life in Iraq to save his fellow American soldiers in 2004. It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Khan s) life,  she said.But again, George W. Bush was president when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. Obama was a senator at the time and he voted AGAINST the invasion. The Iraq War created a power vacuum that strengthened Iran s power in the region and allowed ISIS to rise.And Blackwell thoroughly fact-checked Pierson after the commercial break by giving her a history lesson. The origin of ISIS began in Iraq in 2004 and morphed into the organization we know today in 2006.Here s the video via Twitter.@bigcmurr Here is the follow up where Victor Blackwell fact checks Katrina Pierson and her ISIS history.. pic.twitter.com/4FhelNe7ah  Richard W. (@IceManNYR) August 13, 2016And it should be noted that President Bush signed the status of forces agreement that led to the withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq, thus giving ISIS the opportunity to take over large swaths of the country.Nevertheless, the tradition of Republicans blaming President Obama for everything that happened under George W. Bush s watch continues.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"August 13, 2016"
 Van Jones Just Gave The Most Hilariously PERFECT Description Of His Trump-Supporting Friend Jeffrey Lord,"If you watched CNN during this highly contentious election cycle, you likely saw Democrat Van Jones go toe-to-toe with Jeffrey Lord, who is an ardent Trump supporter. The two agree on next to nothing, but there is one thing folks likely don t really know about the on-air rivals: They re actually really good friends. Jones had this to say about why he is friends with Lord, when it is quite obvious that they are polar opposites on everything: How can you not like Jeffrey? He s adorable. He s like a Fraggle. If a Fraggle had a tendency towards terrible revisionist history. Sure, I could see that. Lord doesn t seem like a mean-spirited person. He s just terribly misinformed, especially when it comes to issues of racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry that constantly plague America. That s obviously a problem; after all, it s this very ignorance that got the likes of Donald Trump elected president. However, that doesn t mean that he s necessarily a bad person. Lord had similar sentiments when asked how he felt about what Jones had to say about him: Which is exactly how I feel about him. I think Van s a terrific person and a great friend. We just disagree on everything, and God bless America. Van Jones and Jeffrey Lord are actually a good example of two people who could be role models for the rest of our incredibly divided nation. With the advances of technology, all you have to do is block people who you find to be intolerable, and you never get to hear the other side. Now, make no mistake   there are PLENTY of Trump supporters who belong in Hillary s basket of deplorables. They are racist, sexist, Islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic bigots whose views have absolutely no place in a diverse melting pot like the United States of America. However, the friendship between these two men should remind us all not to paint with a broad brush. Not all Hillary supporters brushed aside or refused to see her weaknesses as a candidate, and not all Trump supporters are flaming bigots. Perhaps Jeffrey Lord and Van Jones can help heal the hate and divisions, simply by being themselves.Featured image via video screen capture from YouTube",News,"November 18, 2016"
" Thanks, Obama: A Tribute To My Great President","Thank you, President Obama.In 2004, during the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama took the stage and declared that there was no red state America, no blue state America, but a United States of America. That night, my dad told us he would be president one day.Then four years later, he fulfilled my dad s prophecy.Eight years ago, I supported Hillary Clinton in a contentious, bitter primary. I was ready for the first woman president, and I thought she was going to win. How could she not?And a long journey for me and my country began.I looked around me and saw that the comfortable life I have lived was starting to crack   along with every other American citizen. The easier life we all lived post-Clinton was a thing of the past.The economy was collapsing, and people were suffering. Uncertainty plagued every household, every employee and every employer.It seemed that all hope in our great country and the foundation that held it was lost. Teachers, firefighters, office workers and nurses waited for their pink slips. Homeowners waited for their foreclosure notices. Sick seniors dreaded their medical bills.Then flashed on the screen: HOPE AND CHANGE.Handsome, charismatic, and dignified, the junior senator from Illinois, who no one had really heard of before 2008, entered our lives and gave us hope once more. His message shined bright with me and millions of Americans   that our best days were ahead, and if we worked together and trusted one another, we would prevail. It was change we could believe in, and boy did I believe it.And I believe it now more than ever as this great man prepares to leave office, even in the face of an oncoming Trump Administration.The facts remain: the deficit has been cut by two-thirds. The stock market hit its highest points in history (and still continues to grow). Eleven million jobs have been created, 30 million Americans now have healthcare, and the auto industry has been saved. Wages, for all races and incomes, are up for the first time in a decade. Same-sex marriage is the law of the land, and the Pentagon has opened up its door to women in all areas of expertise.In other words   this country has been changed for the better, and it was the hope and perseverance of President Obama that got us here. I can see around me how much better off we are. The truth is right in front of our eyes, we don t need the facts to tell us that (but they certainly don t hurt to have in front of you during a debate).Now that doesn t mean he was perfect. The TPP, the large scale use of drones, the failure to fully communicate Obamacare and the need for a strong government irked me at times. But unlike left-wing and right-wing ideologies, I never looked for a pure president.No one is perfect, and they can never govern perfectly.So with absolutely no help from Republicans, congressional and state, President Obama never wavered in his commitment to allow the American citizen to indulge in the promise that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.We have more liberty, and I believe we are a happier nation because of him.President Obama inspired me to pursue my own happiness. I m a sophomore in college, currently working on a degree in political science. I hope to go to law school, specialize in constitutional law, and utilize my resources to bring change   good change   to Washington D.C. I m a political writer, entering my fourth year of grinding out my passion for politics on paper. All of this, all the passion, anger, hope and sense of accomplishment I have when I write and share it with the world, I owe to President Obama.I ve burned many bridges, ended a couple friendships, and argued with a lot of people defending President Obama and his policies. I have not one regret. And I would do it all over again.I came of age in the era of Obama. My world view of politics and culture have been shaped, in large part, because of him. He is, as some publications put it, the most consequential president in modern America.His presidency, marked with dignity and grace   not scandal   was a gift to America and her people. He showed us what a calm, collected family man from the south side of Chicago could do with a little bit of hope, and yearning for change. A black man with the  funny name  (as he puts it), who grew up without his father and with his white mother and grandparents, transformed the face of this nation for generations to come.How profound is that?I will miss his calm, cool demeanor in times of crisis. I will miss his loving, inspiring message of hope. I ll miss his family   especially Michelle, a First Lady who was the pinnacle of elegance.Thanks, President Obama, my president, for helping this naive and politically inept 11 year old grow up into a passionate, fired-up 19 year old, who only wants to grow and do good for his fellow man.President Obama, you built that. Yes, we can, and yes you did!Featured image via The White House",News,"January 11, 2017"
WHY IT’S GOOD NEWS For Conservatives That Bitter Hillary Can’t Shut Up About Losing [VIDEO],"As a Wellesley graduate, I was shocked and dismayed by Hillary Clinton s commencement address. Actually, that is #FakeNews. I was neither shocked nor dismayed by Mrs. Clinton s speech (but I did graduate from Wellesley   with honors!) It was exactly the kind of self-pitying, leaden and all-about-me performance that I would have expected from the entitled former Democrat candidate and now sore loser.Watch a few of Hillary s greatest hits during her commencement speech at Wellesley College:Also, it revealed this: Hillary hasn t learned a thing. As her friend Mike Bloomberg recently told an audience of Harvard Business School grads   Hillary lost the election because she had absolutely no message. She still doesn t.In addition, she is utterly lacking in self-awareness. She spoke at length about what she sees as a  full-fledged assault on truth and reason,  telling the graduating seniors that  the future of America, indeed the future of the world, depends on brave, thoughtful people like you insisting on truth and integrity right now every day.  This, from a woman who ran for our nation s highest office while distrusted by nearly two-thirds of the country, with good reason.As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.In her remarks, Hillary criticized  people    aka Trump followers, presumably   on social media for  sowing division at a time when we desperately need unity,  and then proceeded to give a highly partisan and divisive speech.Did she ever consider that there might be families in the audience who voted for her opponent? That they might not enjoy her taking veiled potshots at President Trump, and that this was their daughters  day too?Echoing the liberal media, Hillary went after President Trump through innuendo and clich s, talking about the dangers of fomenting fear and of  alternative facts.  Good thing there was no Q&A; someone might have wanted further clarification of how she came under sniper fire in Bosnia, or how a video caused the Benghazi attack or how the Monica Lewinsky scandal stemmed from a  vast right-wing conspiracy  and not Bill Clinton s unruly libido.Hillary trod dangerous pathways as she remarked,  when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.  She is correct, of course, but a cursory review of her multiple dodges and lies about her mishandling of classified information and efforts to destroy evidence reveals a woman who fully earned her low trustworthiness ratings from Americans.The election is over, but Hillary cannot let it go. This is good news for Republicans. As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton missed an opportunity at Wellesley. She could have delivered a message of unity, and helped our anxious country begin to heal. Her followers need to see her putting country above politics; they need to see her as she briefly appeared at the inauguration, supporting the peaceful and legitimate transfer of power. Apparently, that is just too heavy a lift for Mrs. Clinton. She is happier nursing her wounds, and continuing to inflict them on the country.The former First Lady could also have talked about the dramatic changes taking place in our economy, and how women are thriving as entrepreneurs. She could have talked about the founders of Rent the Runway, or Sarah Blakely, who created Spanx, or Essie Weingarten, who bet her life s savings on a new idea and created a nail polish empire sold to L Oreal in 2010. These women are inspirational; they didn t shatter glass ceilings, they ignored them. It is true we need women in politics, and running NGOs, but we also need women making money and boosting the economy. That s where the funding for free college tuition and refugee services comes from   a lesson Hillary may never have learned.The New York Times tells us that the students cheered Mrs. Clinton  thunderously.  Of course they did. They have been weaned on courses like  Love and Intimacy  in the Women s and Gender Studies department or  Changing Gender Constructions in the Modern Middle East  in the History Department. There s nothing wrong with those studies, unless they crowd out learning how the progressive policies of Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have failed in France, for instance, leading to a stagnant economy with few opportunities for progress. Or how capitalism has delivered billions from poverty, including in Communist China, where the growth miracle of recent decades was facilitated by policies that encouraged entrepreneurship and private enterprise.Hillary Clinton missed some history lessons too, apparently. She alluded to Nixon s presidency which  would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.  That isn t true, of course; Nixon resigned from office. It was her husband Bill who was impeached. Amazing she would get that wrong, in delivering what was sure to be a much-reviewed address. Maybe a little too much of that Chardonnay, Mrs. Clinton?

 Bill Kristol: Independent Candidate Will Announce Candidacy Against Trump,"As Republicans unite around GOP candidate Donald Trump, all hope seems to be lost for the  Never Trump  camp.But Republican strategist, commentator and neoconservative Bill Kristol may have just revived the  Never Trump  camp with one tweet:Just a heads up over this holiday weekend: There will be an independent candidate an impressive one, with a strong team and a real chance.  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) May 29, 2016Although Kristol has in no way hinted at who that candidate may be, one can assume it could be from a shortlist of conservatives who have been openly hostile to Trump: Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Governor of New Mexico Susana Martinez, or perhaps Kristol himself.Should a conservative  Independent  run against Donald Trump, such a move would all but ensure a Clinton victory. A split GOP would pave the way for not only a Democratic takeover of the White House, but the GOP would suffer badly in their vulnerable Senate elections, and Democrats could very well take back the House.Simply put, Republicans putting in a third party candidate would be the revolution Sanders and Trump have been talking about all along, and neither would benefit much from it.It s amazing that Republicans haven t learned their lesson from the last two elections   that a last minute effort to add pizzazz to an election never bodes well for their end game. They learned that when McCain tried to pander to women with Sarah Palin in 2008, and they learned that in 2012 when they tried to entice business Republicans with Mitt Romney.Perhaps this third party candidate, aside from Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, could have a real representation by the electorate, sending a strong message to the GOP that their flirtation with right-wing extremism needs to come to an end once and for all.Maybe that was the GOP s end game after all   put the final nail into the coffin that is extremism and start anew, because with America s growing diversity, they won t last long cow towing to the crazies.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images",News,"May 30, 2016"
 WATCH: Republican Lawmaker Gets Relentlessly Booed And Heckled For Obamacare Repeal Vote,"The boos rained down after a Republican congresswoman thought she could get away with voting to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare.GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers made an appearance at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally to spew bullshit about unity and how  change and progress  have come to Washington DC because of Donald Trump.That didn t sit well with the crowd, who showered Rodgers with boos and jeers after someone in the audience literally shouted  Bullshit!  in response to her claims that she will work hard for the people in her district.Chants of  Save our healthcare!  then drowned out Rodgers, who fled the stage as someone called her a  liar. Here s the video via YouTube.Rodgers ignored the anger of her constituents and tried to drone on but soon left the stage. Considering that Rodgers is literally sentencing millions of people to death by voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, she s lucky the crowd let her leave and didn t tar and feather her in the public square.Afterwards, she then released a bullshit statement claiming that Republicans are working on a  smooth transition  to repeal and replace Obamacare so people don t lose their coverage. No one who has coverage because of Obamacare today, will lose that coverage the day it s repealed   we re committed to a smooth and stable transition for those currently receiving care,  Rodgers said.A spokesperson for Rodgers later added, The Congresswoman looks forward to keeping the lines of communication open when discussing how to ensure a smooth and stable transition out of Obamacare to put in place a 21st Century health care system. Most Americans oppose repealing Obamacare without a suitable replacement or don t want it repealed at all.But Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare last week without having any plan at all to replace it with, and they STILL don t have a plan, despite how many times they claim to be working on one.Featured image via screenshot",News,"January 17, 2017"

 Phoenix Newspaper Breaks The Internet In Brutal Tweetstorm On Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio,"A Phoenix publication took to its Twitter account to explain the kind of person former Sheriff Joe Arpaio is following Donald Trump s decision to pardon him. The former reality show star pardoned the racist former Sheriff of Maricopa County while a hurricane was barreling down on Texas. Trump is likely testing his pardoning powers to use that same privilege for the Russia investigation.Joe Arpaio called himself  America s toughest sheriff,  but appeared to be begging for a pardon after he was convicted of criminal contempt in July after violating a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Arpaio, 85, was ordered to stop profiling Latinos but he couldn t stop himself.Trump tweeted,  I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He kept Arizona safe!  but the Phoenix New Times which has covered Arpaio for two decades reminded everyone that the former sheriff is no patriot.We've been covering Joe Arpaio for more than 20 years.

With only $4.7 million available, it s gonna be difficult to throw a coronation for Hillary. Already struggling with finances, the Democratic Party has drafted a plan to have taxpayers help pay about $20 million for next summer s nominating convention, reversing a change Congress approved just a year ago.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is also a congresswoman from Florida, has drafted a bill to restore money that both parties used to receive from the federal government to help defray the costs of running their quadrennial conventions.The Congressional Budget Office revealed the move in a letter released Friday, which said Ms. Wasserman Schultz s proposal to tap a presidential campaign fund would likely mean each party could get about $20 million in taxpayer money to help with costs.The DNC is facing tough financial circumstances. The latest report shows it had just $4.7 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 31, less than the $6.9 million in debts the committee reported. By contrast, the Republican National Committee reported $20.4 million in cash, offset by $1.9 million in debts.Neither the DNC nor Ms. Wasserman Schultz s congressional office returned messages seeking comment on her plans.Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said the party doesn t need the help.Read more: WT",politics,"Dec 14, 2015"
 MSNBC Just Fact Checked Trump’s Voter Fraud Lies In Real Time And It Was GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"Although most of America did not want Donald Trump to be the country s next President, many of us were holding on to hope that we might see an improved version of what we witnessed during the former reality TV star s presidential campaign. Unfortunately, Trump and his team are proving to be worse than we thought, and they re only churning out more fear mongering and lies during his first week in office.New White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has continuously been backing up Trump s voter fraud claims since starting his new position. Trump has been trying to convince America that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the 2016 election, and Spicer has doubled down on those comments recently. Fortunately, the media has been on top of it, obviously frustrated at the lack of transparency from the new President. As Spicer lied his ass off on national television, MSNBC s Katy Tur fact-checked him in real time, and it was pretty amazing. Despite having zero actual evidence that voter fraud occurred, Spicer said: I think there s been studies that came from Pew in 2008 that showed fourteen percent of people who voted were not citizens. There are other studies that have been presented to him. It s a belief he maintains The President does believe that, I think he s stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him. Here s what Tur said as she fact-checked Spicer on air: We want to do a little bit of fact checking on that statement because the White House now is referring to the same research that the campaign had referred to, and the transition had referred to. One was a Washington Post commissioned study which the Washington Post itself debunked, and the other one was a Pew study from 2012, which is actually from 2008, which said that approximately 24 million   one in every eight people are on voter registrations in the United States that no longer valid   and they are significantly inaccurate. Listing people who had died in the past, obviously, on the voter rolls. It doesn t mention anything about undocumented immigrants, so their basis of evidence isn t quite correct at all.

"BEYONCE DOUBLES DOWN…Debuts #LEMONADE, Another Race Baiting, Cop-Hating, Pro-Obama Song…With Sweet Michael Brown’s Mama and Serena Williams","Most of the world will be obsessed with Beyonce s new release, Lemonade because of her unexpected confession that she is married to a cheating pig. We have instead chosen to focus instead on the continuing efforts of the dynamic racist duo to promote distrust and hate for our law enforcemen, while helping their dear friend Barack Obama to promote racial division in America. Beyonce s self-portrayal as a saint leading women to baptism is laughable considering the hateful and divisive messages she continues to promote in her songs. She has become nothing more than a tool for Obama and the Black Lives Matter terror group. Anyone who buys her music from her husband s racist label is making a direct contribution to hate.The mothers of Trayvon Martin and and Michael Brown are featured in Beyonce s new album, which was released on Jay-Z s Tidal streaming service on Saturday night after an HBO special promoting it.Lemonade is the title of both the singer s first album in three years, and the  visual album  which aired on HBO to promote it. And the singer continued to lace her work with a political message, as well as hitting out at her husband Jay-Z amid rumors of infidelity while ultimately appearing to forgive him.The film which aired on HBO served as a bold tribute to the perseverance of African American women and the Black Lives Matter movement.The pop queen drew a theme early in Lemonade as the film cuts to a snippet from late civil rights leader Malcolm X, who is heard saying:  The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. Later, Mike Brown s mother Lesley McSpadden is seen crying as she holds a photo of her late son, whose shooting death by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 sparked protests and a Department of Justice investigation.Trayvon Martin s mother Sybrina Fulton is also seen holding a photo of her son, who was shot dead at the age of 17 by George Zimmerman, in a case that sparked national outrage in 2012. After screening on HBO, the album will only be available on Tidal, Jay Z s pay-for music subscription. However, HBO will screen a rerun on Sunday April 24 at 8pm Eastern Time.Beyonc  has been known to get political with her music   she caused controversy at the Super Bowl after she and her dancers dressed similarly to the Black Panther Party, which was known for being confrontational with officers.Just before the Super Bowl, Beyonc  released Formation and accompanied the song with a video in line with the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement against perceived police brutality, with one scene showing officers raising their hands up as if under arrest.The video won wide praise from activists and Beyonc s fan base, although her political turn outraged some conservatives.Beyonc , one of the most successful contemporary artists who has mostly avoided controversy in the past, later said in an interview that she was taking issue with abuses, not with all police.The pop queen, whose Formation World Tour begins next month, again got political in the visual album.In addition to playing a quote from Malcolm X, the singer included the mothers of African-American victims of police brutality and gun violence.Mike Brown s mother Lesley McSpadden is seen crying as she holds a photo of her late son, whose shooting death by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 sparked protests and a Department of Justice investigation.Trayvon Martin s mother Sybrina Fulton is also seen holding a photo of her son, who was shot dead at the age of 17 by George Zimmerman, in a case that sparked national outrage in 2012. In another segment, Beyonc  sings about breaking her own chains and being free.And in a spoken-word interlude, a young African-American man talks about how President Obama inspired him.Lemonade also included clips of a young Beyonc  with her father, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc  sits next to him on the sofa, as they exchange  I love yous. The film begins with a mention of her father, as Beyonc  whispers:  Where do you go when you go quiet? You remind me of my father, a magician, able to exist in two places at once.  In the tradition of men, in my blood you come home at 3am and lie to me. What are you hiding?  she whispers.And she makes numerous pointed references to an unfaithful lover   before her husband Jay Z appears as she sings about forgiveness. In the fourth track of the album, titled Sorry, Beyonc  sings:  Middle fingers up, put them hands high. Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye. Tell him, boy, bye, middle fingers up. I ain t thinking bout you. She concludes:  He better call Becky with the good hair.  The scene drove viewers and listeners wild, with thousands of comments flooding Twitter about this elusive  Becky . Within minutes  #BeckyWithTheGoodHair  was trending on Twitter.As she sits at a piano alone, viewers see flashback scenes of her wedding to Jay Z in 2008, and them lying in bed together. My daddy warned me about men like you,  she sings.  Cause every promise, don t work out that way. Nothing seems to hurt like the smile on your face.  At one point she sings  Are you cheating on me?  then later says she is  jealous and crazy .Later, the couple appear together as she sings:  Baptize me. Now that reconciliation is possible, if we re gonna heal, let it be glorious. Another clip showed the pair getting matching  IV  tattoos on their ring fingers in a tribute to their daughter Blue Ivy.But anyone that wants to rewatch it will have to download Tidal, which holds exclusive rights to the whole album.Tidal, which costs $9.99-a-month, is Jay Z s attempt to rival free services like Spotify and YouTube, which he claims to not value artists  content. It was set up in early 2015 after Jay Z bought the company from its Swedish founders. Via: Daily Mail ",left-news,"Apr 24, 2016"
PELOSI JUST FLUNKED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: ‘You Can’t Cry Wolf in a Crowded Theater’ [Video],"Nancy Pelosi just flunked Constitutional Law! Pelosi repeated her request that the National Park Service deny a permit to an alleged  alt-right demonstration  called Patriot Prayer. Pelosi said  not allow these elements to use a national park to spew forth their venom.  She then said that  protecting people  was the Park Service s  first responsibility. This is a trend of the left lately they claim stopping free speech, protests and removing statues have become  homeland security  issues. Jeh Johnson just commented this week that we must remove statues because they ve become a  homeland security  issue. See where this is going? The left claims to be for free speech but in reality they aren t for anyone on the opposing side speaking out. This is getting into dangerous territory but not because of what the right is doing IronicJEH JOHNSON SUDDENLY THINKS CONFEDERATE STATUES ARE A THREAT TO HOMELAND SECURITY: This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!According to David French of National Review:Where to begin? First, It s flat-out unconstitutional for the park service to deny a permit to any group simply because public officials deem the group s speech venomous. Even if their speech is truly vile, they have the same right of access to the park as any other expressive organization.Second, while we want law enforcement to protect people, it is also required to protect liberty. Any police force that maintains security without also protecting liberty has failed in its core constitutional function.Third, the quote is wrong. She s obviously referring to Oliver Wendell Holmes s famous statement in Schenck v. United States that  The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.  Fire. Wolf. Whatever. It s not important compared to the next point below.Fourth, anyone who quotes Schenck is quoting bad law. In fact, it s one of the most  odious free speech decisions in the Court s history.  The court upheld the Espionage Act conviction of the secretary of the Socialist Party of America for writing and distributing a pamphlet opposing the draft during World War I.

HOW CAN ANYONE TRUST THEM? TWITTER Admits To Hiding ANTI-HILLARY and Negative DNC Tweets During Election,"The move by a Twitter employee last week to ban President Trump from the social media platform for 11 minutes received a great deal of attention and offered people a glimpse into how easily someone at Twitter can stop the flow of information from a source he does not like.What did not get a great deal of attention, however, was the fact that Twitter s Acting General Counsel, Sean Edgett, admitted in a prepared statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the platform regularly blocked tweets offering information that could paint the Clinton Campaign and DNC in negative lights.Writing for NewsWars, Jerome Corsi notes:At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Tuesday, Sean Edgett, Acting General Counsel for Twitter, admitted in his prepared testimony that Twitter employed in the 2016 election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical (of) Hillary Clinton, including the hashtag #PodestaEmails and the hashtag #DNCLeaks. Is anyone surprised?Twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even USA Today brought it up, noting that Twitter s behind-the-scenes team was quick to ban right-wingers like Milo Yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever-so-entertaining actress Leslie Jones.Yet, conservatives say, nothing happened to rapper Talib Kweli and his followers when they attacked black Breitbart reporter Jerome Hudson with racial slurs. When Breitbart contributor Kassy Dillon complained about a Twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages, Twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot Dillon in the head. Now, the big story that many in the pop media evidently don t want you to see is that Twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to HRC and the DNC during the 2016 election. The Twits claim that they were simply stopping  spambots  from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people (one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place, but that s a different matter), but hidden in their statements are some  tells  that indicate otherwise.For example, Dr. Corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the Judiciary Committee, Edgett stated:For example, our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated Tweets promoting the #PodestaEmails hashtag, which originated with Wikileaks  publication of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta s Gmail account. The core of the hashtag was propagated by Wikileaks, whose account sent out a series of 118 original Tweets containing variants on the hashtag #PodestaEmails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the Wikileaks website.So, automatically, what Mr. Edgett has admitted tells us that Twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user, Wikileaks, offering authentic information that Wikileaks had published revealing real, confirmed e-mails sourced from John Podesta and the DNC. Those e-mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the DNC that worked against Bernie Sanders  campaign, and in favor of Mrs. Clinton s campaign, and later revealed extremely important information about what Mrs. Clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of Syria and the underlying, unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.Edgett also testified that Twitter hid 25% of the  #PodestaEmails  tweets, andAs described in greater detail below, our systems detected and hid just under half (48%) of the Tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag, #DNCLeak, which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Those would be the e-mails that revealed towering corruption at the DNC and in many offices of pop media   things like new reporters working with the Clinton campaign to offer her easy questions, things like Donna Brazile, then an employee of CNN, feeding Hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman, Bernie Sanders.These are issues that were real, and the more people knew about them, the more they disliked Mrs. Clinton   and the more she and the DNC hackmeisters pushed the spurious  Russia Hack  narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance.For entire story- MRCTV ",left-news,"Nov 6, 2017"
"BOOM! SHAREHOLDER Confronts Liberal Starbucks CEO Over Damage To Stock Value After Saying He’ll Hire 10,000 Refugees…Questioned Why Schultz Ignored Obama’s Travel Ban [VIDEO]","Americans who are sick and tired of leftist CEO s using their public positions to attack President Trump and his efforts waged a huge boycott against Starbucks and the Starbucks brand: Kudos to this shareholder for standing up and confronting Schultz over his selfish decision to publicly shame President Trump in his efforts to keep terrorists from entering our country With Starbuck s stock underperforming, its about time someone questioned Starbucks s liberal agenda. Just don t expect the media to care.A conservative think tank, The National Center for Public Policy Research, confronted outgoing controversial Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. As an owner of Starbucks stock, the group sent its General Counsel Justin Danhof to Starbucks s annual shareholders meeting on March 22. There, he questioned Schultz for his public liberal opinions that may have hurt the company s stock price.In reference to Schultz s Jan. 29 decision that Starbucks would hire 10,000 refugees, Danhof asked Schultz  How much will Starbucks investors have to spend so that the company can properly vet refugees that the federal government admits it can t afford to vet? He also asked Schultz why he condemned President Donald Trump s immigration order but  lacked the courage to speak out against the Obama-Clinton travel ban? Watch:",politics,"Mar 27, 2017"
(VIDEO) KEY CLINTON STATE DEPT EMPLOYEE BLOCKED RELEASE OF POLITICALLY SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS,"(VIDEO ABOVE)STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON HARF WON T COMMENT ON THE CHERYL MILLS BLOCK OF SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTONHillary s Chief of Staff could be part of the key to the truth of so much corruption. Cheryl Mills ran interference the night Benghazi broke. Hillary s claim that an anti-Islam video, created Benghazi, was promoted by Mills. Benghazi information was compromised by Ms. Mills but it would be asking too much to expect her to come clean on it. Truth just isn t in the cards for any of these lowlifes.WASHINGTON When Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, her staff scrutinized politically sensitive documents requested under public-records law and sometimes blocked their release, according to people with direct knowledge of the activities.In one instance, her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, told State Department records specialists she wanted to see all documents requested on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and later demanded that some be held back.In another case, Ms. Mills s staff negotiated with the records specialists over the release of documents about former President Bill Clinton s speaking engagements also holding some back.The records requests came under the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, the public s main tool to get information from the government. Decisions on what to release belong with each agency s FOIA staff, say experts on the law, to guard against the withholding of documents for political or other inappropriate reasons.Questions about the transparency of Mrs. Clinton s State Department tenure have been bubbling ever since it was revealed that she exclusively used a private email account to conduct her work as secretary. The existence of that private system, which is being investigated by a House special committee probing the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, meant the department didn t have access to her emails when public requests to see them came in.Read more: WSJ",politics,"May 21, 2015"

An average of $84,153 for government pay is unbelievable! No wonder the suburbs surrounding Dc are some of the wealthiest in the Country. Ridiculous!Employees for the federal government earn far more than their counterparts in the private sector, according to a new study by the Cato Institute.Federal workers  pay and benefits were 78 percent higher than private employees, who earned an average of $52,688 less than public sector workers last year.The study found that federal government workers earned an average of $84,153 in 2014, compared to the private sector s average of $56,350. Cato based its findings on figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).But when adding in benefits pay for federal workers, the difference becomes more dramatic. Federal employees made $119,934 in total compensation last year, while private sector workers earned $67,246, a difference of over $52,000, or 78 percent.via: WFB",Government News,"Oct 8, 2015"

Donald Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By A 10-Year-Old Girl (VIDEO)
","A 10-year-old girl smacked down Donald Trump, and it was amazing.On Saturday, the Huffington Post interviewed Lexi, an adorable Hillary Clinton volunteer who had absolutely no problem shredding the Republican billionaire when asked how she feels about him.Lexi slammed Trump for having zero experience in government and compared him to her brother who thinks he knows everything. Number one, he doesn t have any experience, at all,  Lexi said.  And he sits there and thinks,  Oh I m Mr. Donald Trump, I know everything,  which is sort of like my brother. She also broke the bad news to Trump s supporters that if they think they ll get money by voting for Trump, they are sorely mistaken. He s just rich, a lot of people just vote for him because they think they ll get some money, too. But that s not it. You think you re going to get the money, but that s not the case. Lexi then took aim at Trump s xenophobia and racism and made it clear what parents who vote for Trump can expect of their children s future should he get in the White House. Oh, and she also had positive things to say about Bernie Sanders, who she sees as someone who is  building an environment for the kids. It s ridiculous because I mean, look at these people, your best friend you may not know is Muslim or Jewish. And Bernie Sanders, he s Jewish. You don t see anybody talking about that. He s just building an environment for the kids, their parents are voting for Donald Trump, but little do they know that their kids will grow up not having a good education and not having good jobs. Lexi then warned that if people fail to show up and vote on Election Day in November, it could mean a Trump victory. And she thinks his hair is  gross. If you don t vote, then Mr. Donald Trump will be president. I don t think that s his real hair, being president. His hair, look at it! Look at it! It s gross. I can t believe that s his real hair.

" Hillary Delayed Telling Staff Her VP Pick, Instead Left Roses For Orlando Victims (IMAGES)","Donald Trump has been touting himself as a pro-LGBT candidate because he s going to kill Muslims or something, but one thing he has never done is pay more than lip service to the LGBT community.

The Obama administration is turning to the United Nations to help screen migrants fleeing violence in Central America, senior administration officials said Tuesday, and to help set up processing centers in several Latin American countries in the hopes of stemming a flood of families crossing the southern border illegally.Designed to head off migrants from three violence-torn countries in the region before they start traveling to the United States, the new refugee resettlement program will be announced by Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday in Washington. Under the plan, the United Nations refugee agency will work with the United States to set up processing centers in several nearby countries, where migrants would be temporarily out of danger.As it does in other places, the United Nations will determine if the migrants could be eligible for refugee status. The administration officials said thousands   perhaps as many as 9,000   migrants each year from the three countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, could eventually settle in the United States. But some refugees would also be sent to other countries in the hemisphere, officials said.For entire story: NYT",Government News,"Jan 14, 2016"
 BREAKING: Trump Is Now Directly Threatening Electors Who Don’t Vote For Him,"If you want to know what kind of President Donald Trump will be, if he will execute the powers of his office in a manner that is fitting for an American President. look no further than his team s recent threats against electors who might be considering voting against our first Russian-installed President-elect.The Electoral college votes on December 19   so while Donald Trump may have kinda-sorta  won  the election by losing the popular vote by a historic margin, there is still a chance that he will not be our next President. Unfortunately for Trump, they seem to be taking the Russian hacking thing seriously, demanding a full briefing before they vote. We intend to discharge our duties as Electors by ensuring that we select a candidate for president who, as our Founding Fathers envisioned, would be  endowed with the requisite qualifications,  the open letter from electors to U.S. Director Of National Intelligence.  [T]he Constitution envisions the Electoral College as a deliberative body that plays a critical role in our system of government   ensuring that the American people elect a president who is constitutionally qualified and fit to serve. According to reports in the Washington Post, New York Times, and other outlets, the United States intelligence community has now concluded definitively that the Russian interference was performed to help Donald Trump get elected, yet even today Mr. Trump is refusing to accept that finding,  the letter continues.  Separate from Mr. Trump s own denials of Russian involvement in the election, the confirmed communication between Trump s aides and those associated with the Russian election interference activity raise serious concerns that must be addressed before we cast our votes. This may present a problem for a guy whom the CIA confirmed had a lot of help from a foreign power via hacking and propaganda, but Trump s solution is simple (terrifyingly simple): threaten them into compliance. We have gotten reports from multiple people,  an elector told Salon under condition of anonymity,  that the Donald Trump campaign is putting pressure on Republican electors to vote for him based on . . . future political outcomes based on whether they vote for Donald Trump or not.  These reports, the elector says, come from Republican electors who say that violence was not threatened   instead, the Trump camp threatened to ruin careers and livelihoods. It s all political, basically,  the elector said.  If Trump becomes the president, he s going to be able to put pressure on the state parties and they won t be involved anymore. Let s think about this for a moment: the expected incoming President of the United States was revealed to have been effectively installed by a foreign power after asking them to hack his political opponents. The intelligence community has confirmed that Russia heard his plea for help and stepped up to get him into office. Now, instead of even feigning surprise, Trump is attacking and threatening anyone and everyone who says anything negative about it   the media, electors, even those same intelligence agencies whose investigations proved inconvenient for him.Keith Olbermann recently pointed out that if Trump assumes office, the chances of us ever having a free election again diminish severely. With Trump now threatening those whose job it is to ensure that a tyrant like him doesn t get into office, he seems to be right.Featured image via Getty Images/Steve Pope",News,"December 13, 2016"

The bill easily passed out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee 19-1. Obama would like to see that bill move sooner rather than later.  Congress, led by your congressional delegation, needs to act in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Flint has the necessary resources,  Obama said Wednesday in a speech in Flint.President puns it like ME, calls small-government philosophy  corrosive : The president used the speech to broadly attack the conservative philosophy of less-government-is-good-government, saying an anti-government attitude was at the root of the problems in Flint.  I do think that part of what contributed to this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitude, that exists in our politics and exists in too many levels of our government,  he said.  It s a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good, no matter what. Boos for Snyder, but not from Obama: Gov.

 Mississippi Landlord Just EVICTED An Interracial Couple Because His Church Told Him To (VIDEO),"With the nation focused on anti-LGBT  religious liberty  battles, a Mississippi landlord has done something that brings focus back to one of our nation s prior fights over  religious liberty    the right to discriminate against interracial couples. In 2011, a poll taken among Republicans in the Red state of Mississippi revealed that a shocking 46 percent of them want to ban interracial marriages outright.In 1946, then-Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo wrote that [p]urity of race is a gift of God   And God, in his infinite wisdom, has so ordained it that when man destroys his racial purity, it can never be redeemed  and that God  was the original segregationist.  He may be dead, and African-Americans may have rights now  (including the freedom to marry anyone they choose) that they did not have when Bilbo was in charge, but his spirit lives on in RV park landlord Gene Baker, who admitted over the weekend that he evicted an interracial couple simply because they were an interracial couple. Me and my husband, not ever in 10 years have we experienced any problem,  said Erica Flores Dunahoo, who is Hispanic and Native American.  Nobody s given us dirty looks. This is our first time.  Her husband, a former National Guardsman of more than a decade, is black   something that bothers the racist landlord s friends, neighbors, and church.In February, Dunahoo and her husband, Standley Hoskins, and their two children were set to move into an RV sace to save money and  get our life on track,  the lighter half of the interracial couple explained. On February 28, she gave Baker a check for $275 to pay for a month s rent. This should have been the end of it   she paid her rent and inexchange she should have been allowed to stay. In fact, there were no problems that first day. He was real nice,  she said.  He invited me to church and gave me a hug. I bragged on him to my family. Unfortunately, the next morning, Baker called her, fuming:Dunahoo told him that she didn t realize it would be a problem. It is, after all, 2016. Oh, it s a big problem with the members of my church, my community and my mother-in-law, Baker told her.  They don t allow that black and white shacking. We re not shacking. We re married,  she replied, but Baker would have none of it, explaining that  it s the same thing. You don t talk like you wouldn t be with no black man,  the church-going  Christian  continued.  If you would had come across like you were with a black man, we wouldn t have this problem right now. Dunahoo explained that her husband is not a  thug,  and told Baker of his distinguished and lengthy service to our country, but that didn t matter to the landlord. All he saw was black. He returned the $275 and forced them to leave. They took refuge at another RV park, where rent is higher   $325 a month.Baker maintains that he is not a racist, telling the Clarion-Ledger that he only refused to provide a space to the couple because of the issues members of his church and community had with a black man and a light-skinned woman shacking.  He even says they would be welcome to attend his church. They just could not be members, because the church does not believe in interracial marriage.To avoid future issues, he plans to completely close his RV park down just in case he ever encounters another interracial couple who wishes to rent a space: I m closing it down, and that solves the problem. Recently, the Mississippi state Senate passed a  religious liberty  bill allowing businesses to deny service to the LGBT community   just like they used to do (and some individuals currently still do) with interracial couples.Hate is hate   and unfortunately the state of Mississippi is full of it, apparently.Watch a report on this blatant and unabashed act of discrimination below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 3, 2016"
BOOM! FOX NEWS LEFTIST CHRIS WALLACE Attempts Trump Smear Over Inauguration Crowd Size…FOX News’ Brit Hume Backs Up Trump On Fake News Story [VIDEO],"The AP, CNN, People Magazine and other mainstream media, fake news outlets used pictures of the crowds at Obama s inauguration to compare to the crowd s at Trump s inauguration. The only problem is, the picture they used for Trump s inauguration crowd was taken before Trump s actual speech, where the crowds were much larger.Of course, there was never a comparison between Obama and George W. Bush s inauguration crowds, because instead of the full-blown media assassination attempt we see against President Trump, the post-inauguration media coverage was more like an all out effort to canonize Barack Obama by our sycophant media.The media completely ignored the fact that threats of violence were being made by Soros funded groups against Trump supporters since the day after the election. They ignored the open threats made against anyone who dared to attend Trump s inauguration.Anti-Trump rioters made good on their threats. They used human chains to lock visitors out of certain areas including check points where Trump supporters had to pass through in order to get to the inauguration and to the parade.Watch this husband and wife, as they are split up by human barricades. The husband manages to break through the barricade but the wife is trapped and unable to join him.

Rioters wearing black ski masks and carrying sledge hammers they used to bust out windows of banks and vehicles were roaming the streets as well.None of these threats existed prior to or during Obama s inauguration. It s pretty safe to say that angry Democrats and anarchists roaming the streets looking for trouble didn t make for the most family friendly environment. Many Trump supporters admitted they wouldn t attend the inauguration because they feared violence against them and their children. But the media just glossed over the fear factor created by the Left, and chalked it up to Trump s sudden (according to fake polls)  unpopularity. Here are the propaganda photos used by the media to discredit Trump.Comparing the crowds at Donald Trump s and Barack Obama s inaugurations https://t.co/YysDewDB9N pic.twitter.com/myrXutzMpH  NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) January 21, 2017For the record, here is an actual picture that was taken during Trump s inaugural speech. The mall appears to be jam packed with Trump supporters:Chris Wallace jumped on the mainstream media train this morning and attempted to discredit Trump and his Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Chris Wallace asked to have the picture comparing Trump and Obama s crowds up on the screen for the viewers to see before confronting  Reince Priebus. Priebus responded,  You re also not saying that that picture was taken before he even began speaking.  Chris Wallace freaks, and asks to have the picture put back up again (which of course doesn t change what Priebus just said).Watch:Fox News  Senior Political Analyst, who also attended the inauguration, tells a much different story than the one Wallace was trying to paint. Perhaps Wallace should have consulted with Hume, since they both work for the same network. Perhaps he should have asked about how the violent protesters affected the number of people who were actually able to make it to the inauguration. To be sure, Brit Hume was no cheerleader for Donald Trump leading up to the election, but at least he had the integrity to tell the truth about the deceitful media s attempt to prove Trump supporters have somehow magically deserted him.I was in the building at the bottom of picture on right yesterday.

Is Obama Using The Refugee Resettlement Of Muslims To Give ISIS World Domination?,"Since Obama was sworn in as President hundreds of thousands of  refugees  have come to America most of them Muslim. We re also seeing thousands of people from all over the world cross our Southern border illegally. With the virtual invasion via illegals and refugees, is Obama trying to give America to ISIS? It is a question worth asking if you look at the facts: DHS has just announced that ISIS is infiltrating the Refugee Resettlement Program. No shocker there. And yet, not only does Obama refuse to shut it down, he s bringing more and more in. Treasonous much? He s also going after our guns and constitutional rights in an attempt to strip them from us just when we need them the most. ISIS PLANS GLOBAL DOMINATION: A document has just surfaced which outlines how ISIS organizes its territory and controls it. I am not surprised. I would have expected nothing less from the Caliphate. They are a conquering force after all, so it makes sense that they would be the ultimate, brutal community organizers.Before we get into that, the latest on ISIS is that Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour is dead in Afghanistan. He was mortally wounded in a shootout last Tuesday and succumbed to his wounds sometime within the next 48 hours. If true, this is a death blow to the Taliban in Afghanistan by ISIS and is very bad news. As horrific as the Taliban is, ISIS makes them look like amateurs.Experts say they can t figure out where ISIS is getting their funding. Are you kidding me? They are big business: drugs, oil and they are backed by various countries behind the scenes and other players in geopolitical manipulations. ISIS will spread through Afghanistan like a malignant cancer. Slaughter and terror will be widespread. ISIS is very organized in their conquest for the Caliphate and they will rule the country with an iron fist and a Quran.I don t believe the Taliban when they say Mansour is still alive. If he were alive, we would have seen him by now. Already, slick propaganda is surfacing from ISIS of their executions of their enemies. It is brutal and gory. I have heard reports of them making the Taliban kneel on explosives and then blowing them up. They also put mortars as necklaces around their necks and then detonate them. The training camps they are setting up all over the place are terrifying and many are flocking to ISIS to join in the fight for the Caliphate. They are the strong horse in the race for the Middle East. ISIS is going from town to town, province to province and slaughtering people and conquering in their wake. They rape women and children, execute infidels and crucify offenders. They take slaves and wealth as they go. It is very reminiscent of Genghis Kahn. People flee in abject terror when they hear that ISIS is approaching.Neither Russia or the United States could take the Taliban out. They live like goats in the mountains of Afghanistan. But ISIS is making short order of them and fast. The trick is to be more brutal and aggressive than your enemy and ISIS has that down to an art. ISIS settled in among the population in Afghanistan and then activated. That is exactly what they are doing in Europe. Things are about to get very, very dicey out there.Now, with this unearthed document, we see how they have global plans. ISIS is already throughout the Middle East and with the Hijrah migration, they are now planted in Europe. Just as they did in Afghanistan, they initially plant themselves within a population before rising up in cells and sweeping the country. They are beginning to do this in America too, thanks to Barack Obama s open borders and Refugee Resettlement Program.Read more: Noisy Room",politics,"Dec 8, 2015"
 Trump’s Rhetoric Just Resulted In A Trillion Dollar Economic Loss Worldwide,"If Donald Trump wants to take credit for something he actually did to the economy, now would be the time.Earlier this week, Trump threatened war against North Korea, resulting in a war of words with Kim Jong-Un and escalated threats that culminated in a Friday morning tweet from Trump.Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2017The rhetorical march towards what could end up being a real nuclear war wrecked havoc on global markets, including Wall Street, as stocks plunged. In all, the economic loss added up to $1 trillion, the effects of which will likely hit households in America and around the world hard.According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,With the tense mood pushing European shares down for a third day and Wall Street set to fall again, global stocks were on course for their worst week since Donald Trump won November s U.S. presidential election. We do just not know what happens next with the North Korea situation,  said BNY Mellon FX strategist Neil Mellor. For quite some time the market hasn t really reacted to things on the Korean Peninsula because we know from the past it is largely North Korean saber-rattling, and it may yet be. But with the rhetoric having gone to a different level, the market just can t afford to take that risk. Many world stock markets have hit record or multi-year highs in recent weeks, leaving them vulnerable to a sell-off, and the tensions over North Korea have proved the trigger.Indeed, Asia Pacific shares just suffered their biggest one-day loss since December. South Korea s KOSPI dropped by nearly a full two percent.In addition,  Australian shares were down 1.3 percent, set for a weekly loss of 0.6 percent and Chinese and Hong Kong bluechips lost 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. What has changed this time is that the scary threats and war of words between the U.S. and North Korea have intensified to the point that markets can t ignore it,  said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney, reports the Post-Dispatch.The Dow Jones has also been falling since Tuesday, the same day Trump threatened North Korea with  fire and fury.  As of Friday, the Dow has shed 300 points.Trump often brags about the stock market even though the record growth began under President Obama. Donald Trump has not enacted a single economic policy since taking office. The stock market had continued setting records thanks to President Obama s handling of the economy and steady leadership. Trump was merely taking credit for Obama s achievement.But now the stock market is falling in America and around the world because of Trump s war rhetoric, which means this trillion dollar loss is all his fault. There is no blaming President Obama for this economic slide. Trump owns this. And more rhetoric or an attack on North Korea will just make things worse.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 11, 2017"

 WATCH: CNN NAILS Trump For Lie That He Would Never Demand Loyalty,"Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility.

WOW! Social Media FREAKS OUT Over What’s Behind MARIAH CAREY During #LasVegas Shooting Interview With Piers Morgan [VIDEO],"Good Morning Britain viewers have been left baffled by pop diva Mariah Carey s appearance on Monday s installment following the breaking news of a shooting in Las Vegas.The 47-year-old hitmaker was due to chat to host Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid about her upcoming Christmas shows in London and Paris before news broke about the shocking incident at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival   which so far has claimed the lives of 50 people and left more than 400 injured.Appearing in a live feed from her Beverly Hills home, Mariah was seen stretched out across a chaise longue in a red gown as the British TV presenters asked her about the attack near the Mandalay Bay Resort and Hotel.The Grammy award-winning singer is no stranger to the world-renowned Vegas strip, having held residency at Caesars Palace s the Colosseum in recent years.Despite admitting she didn t know enough about the attack, Mariah shared her condolences to all who were affected.Following the interview, GMB s Piers took to social media to explain that Mariah s reps knew that they would ask her about the horrific attack.Writing to his 6.12million followers, he retweeted a comment that criticized the interview and added:  We told Mariah s people before the interview. Her reaction seemed very relevant given she s a performer who often resides in Vegas.  Daily MailAlthough fans have come to expect that whenever Mariah is being interviewed, that she will make her viewers uncomfortable, this latest interview with Piers Morgan has created a bit of a social media meltdown. Social media users couldn t get over how Mariah was draped across the sofa like she was posing for a glamorous magazine shoot during the morning talk show.  It was the CHRISTMAS tree in the background, however, that had everyone really questioning her sanity.   Piers Morgan cleared up the confusion about the Christmas tree when he told viewers that,  Mariah was booked to do an interview about her UK Christmas tour.  So without addressing the elephant or Christmas tree if you will, in the room, Morgan was able to explain (kind of) why Mariah Carey was propped up on her couch with a lighted Christmas tree behind her during the first official week of fall ",left-news,"Oct 2, 2017"

In other words, what was NOT said in order to get the judge to approve the FISA warrant to spy:We can start with why law enforcement officials who submitted the application failed to note that the Clinton campaign and DNC funded the dossier. The application does note that the dossier was put together by a  U.S. person  with political motivations, but Republicans have argued that the application should have been more specific.Via Daily Caller: Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Sunday that the Department of Justice is investigating whether the FBI submitted accurate information about the infamous Steele dossier in order to obtain a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Are you, sir, investigating the fact that the FBI used the dossier to get a wiretap against Trump associates and they did not tell the FISA court that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier?

The mother asked about Trump s treatment of Muslim parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son, a decorated Army veteran, was killed in Iraq in 2004. Will there ever be a point in time when you re able to look Trump in the eye and tell him enough is enough?  the woman asked Pence, prompting boos from the crowd.Pence hushed the crowd as the woman had her microphone taken away, and told them,  That s what freedom looks like. That s what freedom sounds like. Pence went on to say,  Captain Khan is an American hero and we honor him and honor his family.  But neither he nor Trump repudiated the nominee s attacks on the family, who spoke out against Trump s proposed anti-Muslim ban at the Democratic Convention.Trump has insisted that he was  viciously  attacked by the Khans and claimed that Ghazala Khan didn t speak up at the convention due to her Islamic faith.Khan said on MSNBC and in an op-ed in the Washington Post that she was overcome with grief still at the death of her son and could not speak up.Trump has been blasted for his insensitivity by the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and other Gold Star family members who have demanded an apology.

NSA ARCHITECT: NSA SNOOPING EXPIRES BUT FEDS WILL CONTINUE SURVEILLANCE OF AMERICANS’ PHONE RECORDS,"This NSA whistleblower has some very interesting things to say about what will happen now that the right to snoop has expired:The AP had this to say about what s happening now with the NSA:Eight days after blocking it, Senate Republicans have agreed to begin debate on a House bill that would overhaul the National Security Agency s handling of American calling records while preserving other domestic surveillance provisions.But that remarkable turnabout didn t happen soon enough to prevent the laws governing the programs from expiring at midnight Sunday as Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a presidential contender, stood in the way of extending the program, angering his GOP colleagues and frustrating intelligence and law enforcement officials.Now, the question is whether the Senate will pass a bill the House can live with. If so, the surveillance programs will resume, with some significant changes in how the phone records are handled. If not, they will remain dormant.The Senate vote on the measure known as the USA Freedom Act can come no earlier than 1 a.m., Tuesday. Senate Republican aides said they expected some amendments, but no major revisions to the bill. Having gone past the brink, the Senate must now embrace the necessity of acting responsibly,  said Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, in a statement after Sunday s Senate vote.The high-stakes drama played out as Congress debated the most significant changes prompted by the disclosures of Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who revealed the phone records collection and other main surveillance programs. With no deal reached in time, the NSA stopped collecting American phone records at 3:59 p.m. EST Sunday, officials said.Other authorities that expired allowed the FBI to collect business records in terrorism and espionage investigations, and to more easily eavesdrop on a suspect who is discarding cell phones to avoid surveillance.",Government News,"Jun 1, 2015"
 Paul Ryan: There Will Be No Mass Deportations (VIDEO),"Now that Donald Trump has scared and fleeced uneducated, gullible people into giving him the White House, there are many concerns regarding many of his campaign promises   namely the insane so-called  deportation force  that will round people up and ship them from the country. Thanks to the many, many protests regarding Trump s win, it is now up to the leadership of the GOP to clean up Trump s mess, because he is incapable of doing so himself. Therefore, House Speaker Paul Ryan went on CNN s State of the Union to speak to Jake Tapper on Sunday, in which he addressed the promise of mass deportations. Ryan said: We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump is not planning on that. That s not what we re focused on. We re focused on securing the border. We think that s first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue. We ve got to know who s coming and going in the country. We ve got to secure the border. Of course, this is not what Trump himself said on the campaign trail. Here is what Trump insisted, via The Hill: You re going to have a deportation force, and you re going to do it humanely, Trump said a year ago. Look, we have to do what we have to do, and Ike did it and other people have done it,  Trump said, referring to President Dwight Eisenhower s policy of deporting 1.5 million people by bus and dropping them off at remote parts of the border.So, whose promise should we trust? Ryan s or Trump s? Considering the lying, sniveling, skeevy nature of today s Republican Party, we must assume the worst   That they are planning on mass deportations, but want people to be caught unaware when they start.These people are truly frightening.

Yes!  Joy proceeded to throw her hands in the air and toss the card containing what ended up being a fake news story, into the air, as a sign of her jubilation over the news that they finally  got  Donald Trump. Joy was not only telling her audience something that wasn t true, she was showing what it looks like when a partisan hack puts their own selfish desires above a potentially serious issue that, if it were found to be true, could potentially be a serious national security issue.Watch:joy behar getting handed the flynn news is the definition of, well, joy pic.twitter.com/Ush7sH5K3r  David Mack (@davidmackau) December 1, 2017Meghan McCain, who was clearly disturbed by her co-host Joy Behar s unprofessional behavior on Friday, gave Behar,  and the rest of the liberal The View panel a piece of her mind on the show today.Watch:The funniest and most delusional part of the video happens when fellow unhinged, liberal, activists and co-hosts of The View attempt to convince their viewers how Hillary could never get away with half of the things Donald Trump has done.

McCain explained,  If we re celebrating a breach of national security   it s going to tear our country apart. McCain then lambasted her co-hosts for spreading  fake news  with her on the panel.

 Colossal White House Screw Up Leads To Trump Endorsing Child Labor In New Ad (VIDEO),"If there is one thing going for the American people against Trump s assault on decency, liberties, and intelligence it s that he and his team are so incompetent that they can t even do the simplest things without humiliating themselves. An obvious example of that sheer stupidity comes at us from this pro-Trump ad, which he recently proudly posted to his Facebook page.Thanks to the crack team over at the White House, a simple spelling mistake turned Trump s coal fetish into a call to relax child labor laws. In boasting about his efforts to kill clean energy and bring back coal, he promised to  put our minors back to work. The word he was looking for was  miners.  Apparently, nobody at Trump s White House noticed the typo. It s been six hours and nobody has bothered to fix it, either.This would be a funny gaffe if it weren t so depressingly common. Trump has issued statements misspelling the names and titles of foreign leaders. Trump has misspelled words as simple and varied as  Denmark  (Denmakr),  honored  (honered),  among  (amoung), and  unprecedented  (unpresidented).A White House statement bragging about Betsy DeVos spelled  education  wrong. She s the Secretary of Education.The Library of Congress gift shop had to pull a poster honoring Trump s inauguration when people noticed it, too, had an ridiculously simple typo.No joke: Purchasable copy of Trump's Inauguration Print, direct from the Library of Congress site. A 5th grader would've spotted this typo. pic.twitter.com/zomWsMojYV  Jules Winnfield (@paulm4749) February 12, 2017Meanwhile, Trump s minor/miner gaffe has another unfortunate side effect for his administration   reminding us that his good friend Newt Gingrich actually wants to repeal child labor laws. As writer Parker Molloy points out, Newt, a full-time moron who moonlights as a part-time shithead on evenings and weekends, once called child labor laws  truly stupid  and suggested poor kids be encouraged to become janitors at their schools, picking up the trash of their classmates to earn lunch money.Speaking at the John F. Kennedy school, Gingrich said that children in the poorest neighborhoods are  trapped in child laws  that prevent them from earning money. Most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school,  Gingrich said according to a CNN video.Trump hasn t gone that far. He s only hinted that he would prefer children work. During Obama s administration when he was eager to pretend the unemployment rate was sky high he would sometimes count children as part of his inflated unemployment figures.Instead of worrying about coal miners and school-aged minors, Trump, who was born rich and stayed that way, might want to invest in some additional schooling for himself. Basic grammar and spelling would be a good place to start.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"June 23, 2017"

"DOJ BLOCKED INVESTIGATION AFTER FBI AGENTS Discovered 650,000 Emails: “Pissed Off”","As federal agents prepare to scour roughly 650,000 emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton s email use, the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee:The Justice Department official was  very pissed off,  according to one person close to Mr. McCabe, and pressed him to explain why the FBI was still chasing a matter the department considered dead.Metadata found on the laptop used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide, suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. It will take weeks, at a minimum, to determine whether those messages are work-related from the time Ms. Abedin served with Mrs. Clinton at the State Department; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe.The new investigative effort, disclosed by FBI Director James Comey on Friday, shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign.Even as the previous probe of Mrs. Clinton s email use wound down in July, internal disagreements within the bureau and the Justice Department surrounding the Clintons  family philanthropy heated up, according to people familiar with the matter.The latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.Those emails stretched back years, these people said, and were on a laptop that hadn t previously come up in the Clinton email probe. Ms. Abedin said in late August that the couple were separating.The FBI had searched the computer while looking for child pornography, people familiar with the matter said, but the warrant they used didn t give them authority to search for matters related to Mrs. Clinton s email arrangement at the State Department. Mr. Weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager.In their initial review of the laptop, the metadata showed many messages, apparently in the thousands, that were either sent to or from the private email server at Mrs. Clinton s home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the FBI. Senior FBI officials decided to let the Weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer, and report back to them.FAST FORWARD TO EARLY LAST WEEK: STUNNING!At a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the department s senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said.Mr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop s contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant.Mr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned Mr. Comey that telling Congress would violate policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey s repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his press conference on the subject in July.The back-and-forth reflects how the bureau is probing several matters related, directly or indirectly, to Mrs. Clinton and her inner circle.New details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in the bureau s investigation of the Clinton Foundation, sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort, and, according to some people familiar with the matter, told agents to limit their pursuit of the case.That led to frustrations among some investigators, who viewed FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case.It isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. McCabe s wife, Jill McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a Clinton Foundation board member.Mr. McAuliffe had supported Dr. McCabe in the hopes she and a handful of other Democrats might help win a majority in the state Senate. Dr. McCabe lost her race last November, and Democrats failed to win their majority.A spokesman for the governor has said that  any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous. Dr. McCabe told the Journal,  Once I decided to run, my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be  supportive.In February of this year, Mr. McCabe ascended from the No. 3 position at the FBI to the deputy director post. When he assumed that role, officials say, he started overseeing the probe into Mrs. Clinton s use of a private email server for government work when she was secretary of state.FBI officials have said Mr. McCabe had no role in the Clinton email probe until he became deputy director, and by then his wife s campaign was over.But other Clinton-related investigations were under way within the FBI, and they have been the subject of internal debate for months, according to people familiar with the matter.Early this year, four FBI field offices New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark. were collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter.Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Clinton Foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation, these people said.The Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a Clinton Foundation board member, these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity.In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn t go well.Some said that is because the FBI didn t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn t a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. That was one of the weirdest meetings I ve ever been to,  one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter.Justice Department officials told the FBI at the meeting they wouldn t authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grand-jury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said.About a week after Mr. Comey s July announcement that he was recommending against any prosecution in the Clinton email case, the FBI sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe, with Mr. McCabe deciding the FBI s New York office would take the lead, with assistance from Little Rock.Director James Comey testified before the House Judiciary Committee in September on a variety of subjects including the investigation into former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s email server. The Washington field office, FBI officials decided, would focus on a separate matter involving Mr. McAuliffe. Mr. McCabe had decided earlier in the spring that he would continue to recuse himself from that probe, given the governor s contributions to his wife s former political campaign.Within the FBI, the decision was viewed with skepticism by some, who felt the probe would be stronger if the foundation and McAuliffe matters were combined. Others, particularly senior officials at the Justice Department, felt that both probes were weak, based largely on publicly available information, and had found little that would merit expanded investigative authority.According to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe, despite the department s refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn t use those methods.The Justice Department official was  very pissed off,  according to one person close to Mr. McCabe, and pressed him to explain why the FBI was still chasing a matter the department considered dead. Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?  Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied,  Of course not,  these people said.Mr. McCabe s defenders in the agency said that following the call, he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the Clinton Foundation investigation: Agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had.Others further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case:  Stand down.  When agents questioned why they weren t allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director Mr. McCabe.Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction.For agents who already felt uneasy about FBI leadership s handling of the Clinton Foundation case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said. For those who felt the probe hadn t yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct, the leadership s approach was the right response.In September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Clinton email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information.Some FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they couldn t  go prosecutor-shopping. Not long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureau s leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey s disclosure to Congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign.Read more: WSJ",politics,"Oct 30, 2016"

 Texas School Officials Request For New Name Goes Horribly Wrong (VIDEO),"Students of Robert E. Lee Elementary School in Austin, Texas, along with their parents, have been battling over the school s name for well over a year.As KXAN reported here, an advisory panel heard testimony from people on both sides of the argument in January.Daniel Oppenheimer, whose children attend the school, told KXAN the name should be changed, saying: It s actually an active deterrent for black families and families of color to attend our school. I think that s reason enough why it s worth thinking about changing. Another parent, Jessica Grogan, expressed similar concerns, telling reporters: I d say my main reason is it is alienating to certain families and I feel like it doesn t represent our community values. Watch video from the January board meeting, courtesy of KXAN below.Following the meeting, the Campus Advisory Board recommended that the school board begin taking steps to change the name of the school.Problem solved, right?Wrong, because it s Texas.The school board asked parents and community members to submit suggestions for the new name.The leading suggestions were as follows:Donald J. Trump Elementary: 45 nominations Robert E. Lee Elementary: 34 nominations Russell Lee Elementary: 32 nominations Harper Lee Elementary: 30 nominations Elisabet Ney Elementary: 15 nominationsThere were plenty of others as well, such as Bleeding Heart Liberal Elementary, Communist Elementary and The Illuminati.Among the least controversial suggestions submitted by Texans were Generic School, Elementary School #1, Bee Movie, Schoolie McSchoolface and The Rubber Duckies.Read all 15 pages of suggested names here.While the original plan was to select from the list of top contenders, it s highly unlikely the school board will approve a name like Donald Trump Elementary.It s sad that so many members of this Austin, Texas community chose not to take the issue seriously. As so many students and parents pointed out, a public school has a duty to ensure that no student is discriminated against and all students feel valued and welcome.The school board hasn t said how it plans to proceed with selecting a new name, in light of the submissions received.The best option appears to be limiting community involvement as much as possible.Featured image via Linda Lawrence via Facebook",News,"April 24, 2016"
 Trump Staff Hangs Absurdly Offensive Abraham Lincoln Banner In Mar-A-Lago Dining Room,"A few years ago, teenage pop star Justin Bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought Holocaust victim Anne Frank would have been a  belieber.  Today, the 70-year-old President of the United States and his enablers pulled a similarly bone-headed stunt. Bieber was 19 at the time. What s Trump s excuse?Visitors to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend, his staff hung banners  honoring  Abraham Lincoln by photoshopping a  Make America Great Again  trucker hat onto the former president s head.This is genuinely hanging in Mar-a-Lago for a dinner honoring Lincoln  pic.twitter.com/sRQLtjwBi4  B (@bXbyrne) March 25, 2017The banner went up in conjunction with a Republican Party of Palm Beach County dinner to celebrate  Lincoln Day.  Honoring Lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments, but connecting him to Donald Trump.They were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well.The cover of the 2017 Lincoln Day Dinner program for Republican Party of Palm Beach County tonight at Mar-a-Lago. @WPTV pic.twitter.com/SJPlB8V6qb  Andrew Lofholm (@AndrewLofholm) March 24, 2017The only person who might find this stunt in good taste is Donald Trump   who recently learned that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. The Florida Republicans hosting the dinner (which, itself, is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it) seemed to take Trump s idea and run with it.That s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking. While it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for 152 years would make of modern life, the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race-baiting grifter like Donald Trump is hard to picture. Trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him. Adding to that, the fact that Lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps America s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently.I mean, seriously  look at this garbage: Look, having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart you know, if you re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true! but when you re a conservative Republican they try oh, do they do a number. It s not exactly  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. If Lincoln were alive today, he would probably have a really articulate, beautiful way of saying  Donald Trump, go screw yourself.  I ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"
MARK LEVIN Outlines Evidence Of Spying By Obama On Trump: “The evidence is overwhelming!” [Video], ,politics,"Mar 5, 2017"
WHY OBAMA IGNORED MURDER BY ILLEGAL ALIEN IN SANCTUARY CITY: You Have Never Seen Megyn Kelly This Mad Before!,"Fox News host Megyn Kelly shut down a liberal guest in a blistering Thursday night exchange about President Barack Obama s silence on the senseless killing of Kate Steinle at a San Francisco tourist area.Kelly observed that the president was only too willing to speak out on the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Freddie Gray killings, but was noticeably silent on Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who d been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. When asked repeatedly this week to speak to this case, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to weigh in, other than to refer folks to the Department of Homeland Security,  Kelly said.  A stark contrast to what we saw after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson [Missouri], a man we now know was attacking a police officer at the time of his death. Liberal talk show host Richard Fowler made the ridiculous claim that the woman would be alive today if Congress had passed immigration reform legislation. Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Answer my question please,  Kelly said.  Give an answer! You can t!   There s no excuse for it! He picks and chooses the victims he wants to highlight. And apparently, this victim wasn t deemed worthy. When political consultant Marc Thiessen asked Fowler to explain his statement that Obama doesn t support sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants, Fowler veered off into left field and again brought up lack of immigration reform, placing the blame on Republican lawmakers for not acting on immigration reform. That s a dodge! Support what you just said, Richard!  Kelly shot back.  Stop it   You keep making these assertions and then you dance off to the sidelines. You said the president doesn t support sanctuary city policies. What do you base that on? I base it on the fact that if we had comprehensive immigration reform there would be no need for sanctuary cities,  Fowler repeated.  And I m pretty sure the White House would tell you the same thing tonight. Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Jul 11, 2015"
INTERVIEW: Did the ‘Alt Right’ Die in Charlottesville?,"The events in Charlottesville have shaken the American political scene.21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen speaks to Sputnik Radio about the tragic incident which took place this past weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.Was the car incident really a  terrorist attack  as it s been portrayed in numerous leftist media outlets? That assessment seems very premature based on available forensics, and prior to a real police investigation and criminal trial. Are violent radical leftist  Antifa  flash mob protesters also culpable for the street chaos   and the casualties that ensued? Are the city and state police also responsible for allowing violent clashes to take place? On the question of Trump and the Alt Right, Henningsen said the while it s senseless to blame the President for the events of the weekend, it s possible that,  the Alt Right may have died in Charlottesville,  and may be unable to overcome the stigma of now being associated with NeoNazis, David Duke, and a dead protestor. This also relates to the current hysterical Left vs. Right hyper-partisan media environment in America which is crippling the national conversation.

Muslims in the United States joined those around the world during the holy month of Ramadan to focus on acts of faith and charity,  they said.

WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT To Recognize Jerusalem As Israel’s Capital,"After it was announced that President Trump was seriously considering moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, he was roundly criticized by the anti-Trump media. Today, Democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers. Pope Francis appealed to President Trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone. In his appeal, Pope Francis said,  Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions, and has a special vocation to peace.   And yawn in Gaza, where the more things change, the more they stay the same, Palestinians burned the U.S. and Israeli flags.The media will try to make everyone believe that Palestinians loved us when Obama was President, even though there is no truth to that fantasy. (See image below)Daily Mail   President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.Appearing in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv.Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today I am delivering. When I came into office I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking,  he said, leaning heavily on a mid-1990s federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation. We have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital   at all,  Trump added.  But today we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It is something that has to be done. Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon seems to think so. Continetti wrote the best piece on Trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.

"CULT CRIMES, MASS SHOOTINGS & MEDIA MIND CONTROL: Natural Born Killers (1994)","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe 1994 cult film Natural Born Killers, is an examination of media manipulation, archetypal psychology and the violence embedded within American pop culture.Although it s been more than two decades since Natural Born Killers (NBK) first shocked viewers with its adrenaline fueled brutality, biting satire and darkly ironic media montages, the enigmatic picture s overall depiction of the American media complex is just as effective today.  CHAOS ROAD    Mickey and Mallory Knox are depraved icons in the twisted world of NBK. (Photo illustration: Shawn Helton)On the film s jarring surface, we see Micky (portrayed by Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (Juliet Lewis) metaphorically reborn (from their violent past) as outlaw-lovers embarking on a psychopathic cross country murder spree   but as well come to find out, there s much more to this psychologically challenging piece of cinema.Over the years, NBK has seen comparisons to Hollywood crime classics such as the Badlands (1973), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), the serial killer  mockumentary , Man Bites Dog (1992), as well as the dystopian mind-bender, A Clockwork Orange (1971). NBK has also been thematically linked to Network (1976), another motion picture with a scathing appraisal of mass media, as well as the 1960 s road-film Easy Rider (1969), and the strikingly similar dark thriller Kalifornia (1993), which also starred Juliet Lewis playing a near identical role.In many ways, much of the media driven subtext of NBK has never seemed more relevant than now, as the film recognized mass media s growing obsession with violence and trashy entertainment all at once. The film also acknowledged the public s fixation with reality TV in all of its incarnations, perhaps envisaging the multi platform information craze in the age of social media.To this day, the Oliver Stone directed controversial feature Natural Born Killers (Based on a story by Quentin Tarantino) remains a harsh critique of American media and pop culture, as it casts a spotlight on the lurid agitprop used to steer public perception through various forms of infotainment.Over the course of this analysis, we ll explore some of the underlying aspects of Natural Born Killers, as well as contextualize its relation to real-life violence seen in the modern era   CULT OF PERSONALITY    Natural Born Killers reflects the heartless transformation of mass media.On The Road: Tragedy & SatireFrom the outset, sight, sound and mood take precedence over a traditional narrative structure throughout NBK. The film begins with a roadside montage of predatory animals (coyote, eagle rattlesnake) struggling to survive while Leonard Cohen s classic song  Waiting for the Miracle  slowly fades in creeping along to the foreboding imagery. The sequence subliminally conjures the all too familiar eugenics based  survival of the fittest  axiom   something which reflects the ruinous and fractured socio-political environment that has become so pervasive in modern America.All the while, the action shifts dramatically from grainy black-and-white footage of America s Southwest, to a red filtered glow, then back to full color, as elliptical-style editing (as well as cross-cutting and parallel) sets the tone for the illusory motion picture magnified by its tension inducing dutch-style camera angles.18 different film formats were used to create NBK in addition to many unusual lighting techniques   everything from black-and-white to dusty old 8mm, to 16mm, to 35mm stock, to CCTV video and animation.  DINE & DASH    NBK sees Mickey Knox on a quest to become Nietzsche s  Overman. When the establishing sequence of NBK finally settles inside the 5 to 2 Cafe, we see a television rapidly changing channel to channel   going from the all-american series Leave It to Beaver, to 77 Sunset Strip, a late 1950 s secret agent crime drama, to the resignation speech of President Richard Nixon, which is juxtaposed against an old horror film relic featuring Boris Karloff.The short panning shot is emblematic of America s dark evolution during the 20th century and serves as a stark bell weather for the rest the high paced surreal picture. In fact, strategically placed images, products and objects are seen throughout the entirety of NBK, evoking a strong emotional response in the viewer   bringing to mind the psychology behind propaganda.   DAEMON    Subliminal dissolves bring a mystical depth to NBK.In the movie s first scene, the camera slips across the cafe, sliding past a character later revealed to be Owen Traft (Arliss Howard), who is a guardian angel or daemon, linked to the Knox pair. Traft vanishes before our eyes (Traft is later seen in the film s prison break sequence) while reading a newspaper about the highway  666  murders, prefiguring the dark media frenzy soon to envelop the Knox outlaws.Celebrating after a fresh deer kill, a pack of foul-mouthed cowboys file into the 5 to 2 Cafe. We then see Mickey order a key lime pie, as his partner in crime Mallory, looking part prostitute, part Pocahontas, seductively dances to the jukebox. Mickey surveys the room and a bright toxic green is contrasted against some of the action within the scene. While some green tones traditionally have a calming restorative quality, the kind used in NBK denotes a sickness inside the mind.  SPIRIT ANIMAL    NBK s cafe cowboys run over a scorpion on the road, impacting their  fate  when facing Mallory and her quasi-totem.Shortly thereafter, Mallory challenges one of the boozed-up misogynistic buckaroos to hand to hand combat just as L7 s Shit List kicks in on the jukebox. The cafe scene erupts into chaos as the soon-to-be famous fugitives dispatch all but one person (the pinball cowboy) in the roadside cafe. The pinball cowboy is kept alive to tell the tale of Mickey and Mallory, in a twisted version of the counting game Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.Following the murderous cafe ruckus, the Knoxes ride out into the desert as wild dissolves intertwine with projected news clippings, images of past crimes and the Hydra myth in the form of a monster flick clip. Additionally, there s a musical schizophrenia to NBK, with a collection of modern and classic songs intermixed with fragmented and atmospheric snippets, signifying a faded, yet stitched together memory in the Trent Reznor/Jane Hamsher selected soundtrack.Later on during a roadside pit stop, Mallory invokes the Book of Revelations and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as she describes seeing a vision of Mickey riding a red (war) horse, while suggesting the star-crossed lovers might be fallen angels. At that same moment, a floating image of a multi-armed Mallory is seen in the sky, bringing to mind the devouring Hindu goddess Kali.  CUPID S REVENGE    NBK s dingy satire of TV sitcoms of old in  I Love Mallory  serves as a dysfunctional backdrop to Mickey and Mallory s hard-edged romance.Oedipal, Electra & the Hidden OrderContinuing by the roadside, the scene drifts into a dream sequence/flashback in the form of a 1950 s style sitcom parody entitled  I Love Mallory.  Here we see Mallory s dysfunctional family completely controlled by her abusive and incestuous father Ed Wilson (Rodney Dangerfield). The scene is an inversion of the soft TV sitcoms dominating the airwaves in real-life, as the lecherous Wilson unleashes a disturbing diatribe amid a background laugh-track.During the same scene, a deliveryman named Mickey enters the frame, falling in love with Mallory at first sight. Mickey leaves with Mallory and in the process steals Ed s car. Later, Mickey is arrested and imprisoned, managing to escape from a prison work farm during a tornado. NBK s tornado prison break, may be seen as a reference to the classic film The Wizard of Oz  a storm system which forever alters Mickey s future world.Mickey and Mallory return to the Wilson residence, seeking revenge on Mallory s father and mother, in what could be seen as a loose interpretation of the dark lyrical finish to the enigmatic song The End by The Doors. The Wilson s are murdered in a shocking home invasion scene and the house is set ablaze, while Mallory s brother Kevin (Sean Stone) is set free during the inferno.With each new set of kills, Mickey and Mallory grow closer and after their demented Oedipal/Electra complex resolution at the Wilson residence, the two get hitched in a blood ritual ceremony filmed on the scenic Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in Taos, New Mexico. Here Mickey proclaims the couple s  marriage  is sanctified because he is the god of his world, conjuring Friedrich Nietzsche s Overman concept, as well as a Apollonian/Dionysian influence within the killer s process.In an analysis entitled,  The Dionysian and the Apollonian in Nietzsche: The Birth of Tragedy,  by Alexander Gatherer of Cardiff University, we are provided a more detailed look at both the Apollonian and Dionysian philosophical concepts: The opposing concepts of the Dionysian (hereon DI) and Apollonian (hereon AP) are central themes within Nietzsche s first major work, The Birth of Tragedy (hereon BT). His contemplation of such opposing forces of nature are primarily used to analyse Greek culture in general, and Greek art in particular, stating that its role in Greek attic tragedy places these plays at Greece s cultural pinnacle. Continuing, Gatherer s essay analyzes critical aspects of AP and DI: Nietzsche s concepts of the AP and DI, along with the entirety of BT, were not well received initially: the author himself called the book  badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused  (Sweet, 1999, p.49). However, the ideas have left a notable legacy and are still discussed in matters of ethics, politics and art. Indeed, Michael Motta (1991) likens the opposing forces to mental illness, stating how stages of mania in bipolar artists can be likened to that of the DI ( The urge to create is great, but the ability to step back, to control the process is reduced ), with depressive phases linked to the AP ( Critique and reflection take precedence over impulsivity, inhibition holds sway over exhibitionism ). With this in mind, we can interpret Mickey and Mallory s unresolved tension between AP and DI, as a philosophical reason for their dissent into madness.Although in Stone s view, Mickey and Mallory are tragically flawed because of a failed system, which frames the prison system, the police system and mass media, as the true American criminals. However, this ideological stance of the film is itself a false paradigm stuck in a social justice vortex, while masked in Carl Jung s rebel archetype   pointing to Stone s sometimes radical political perspective.Returning to NBK, we see Mickey and Mallory make a blood pact and exchange snake rings presented by Mickey, who is connected to the reptilian realm via his Caduceus chest tattoo. At significant points during NBK, snake imagery is observed, recalling the occult and mythological associations of the serpent. Additionally, there seems to be a Shiva/serpent attachment linked to Mickey as a counterpart to Mallory s Kali connection, with an underlying current of the symbol of immortality, Ouroboros. Other distorted biblical themes are also echoed during NBK, such as the Book of Genesis and the Garden of Eden  exemplified by Mickey s assisted escape from prison by a rattlesnake.Many associations are often seen throughout NBK, which reflect a deeper archetypal presence contained within the film.In Anton Ehrenzweig s The Hidden Order of Art, we can explore a deeper analysis of the unconscious mind   many elements that relate to the main characters in NBK: Some evidence of creative work and poemagogic phantasy points to incomplete superego maturation as an important source of mental illness. The ego has not absorbed the death instinct into the mute workings of the creative process so that self-destruction goes rampant to destroy entire itself. In other words, Mickey and Mallory lack any mature ethical component, which leads to their shared self-destructive psychosis, which in turn, is acted out in their murderous rage. Ehrenzweig, coined the phrase poemagogic, which is interpreted as an aspect emblematic of inducing the ego s creativity in a layered dream state. The nightmare/dream state of Mickey and Mallory visually comes to life in the strewn together time-worn scenes of NBK, like fragmented vitriolic memories.  BLOOD BOND    A ritualistic roadside marriage filmed on the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge.Media Made Political AgitatorsWhen NBK continues, all of the berserker-like chaos is captured by Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.), a ratings consumed tabloid host on the fictitious television series American Maniacs. A show which obsessively covers the violent action of Mickey and Mallory at any cost. Gale is an amalgam of Australian TV s investigative host Steve Dunleavy and the long time reporter and talk show host Geraldo Rivera.American Maniacs uses the image of cult leader Charles Manson, University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman, and the sadistic killer Richard Ramirez during its credits, setting the tone for a sordid crime show reminiscent of The Current Affair and Hard Copy. NBK s representation of popular true crime programming, gives the film another disturbing art imitates life layer. In one scene, Gale describes the targeted killing of several law enforcement officers at the hands of the Knoxes   which ironically, reflects many real-life crimes we see plastered across today s headlines in America.All in all, American Maniacs very well could have been a template for the seedy video-stringer film Night Crawler, while packaged in the marketing gloss of American Gladiators. In a world of news makers, Gale says  repetition works,  and when questioned over reusing reenacted death scenes by producers, he callously exclaims do you think those nitwits out there in zombieland remember anything.  This is where we see Gale s mind warping programming taking shape for maximum psychological impact.This is what Stone s film is truly about, showcasing the often cold-hearted and calculating nature of mass media s carefully engineered narrative.With media analysis in mind, we might also consider this passage from Cult of Distraction in The Mass Ornament by film theorist, sociologist and writer, Siegfried Kracauer: Here, in pure externality, the audience encounters itself; its own reality is revealed in the fragmented sequence of splendid sense impressions. Were this reality to remain hidden from the viewers, they could neither attack nor change it; its disclosure in distraction is therefore of moral significance. Whether its banal programming intermixed with mass media s terror lens, the viewer has a choice to accept the media manipulated distractions at wholesale or attempt to unpack them through critical thinking, questioning the very nature of reportage.   AMERICAN MANIAC    Gale s American Maniacs glorifies tragedy for ratings.As NBK moves forward, we see the media trail and trial of Mickey and Mallory after the duo has been taken into custody. In a mockumentary style scene centered around super-fans and tacit supporters of the Knoxes, there s a decidedly social justice flair to a series of fictitious man on the street interviews.The whole segment relates to various political agitator groups that we see today   like Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and the controversial identity focused activism of Black Lives Matter (BLM), as well as the FBI and the CIA s various counter-intelligence programs from the 1960 s and 1970 s. Both OWS and BLM alliances, are neo-liberal think-tank/NGO designed gatherings, meant to divide and control participants over class, identity and other socio-political concerns.NBK s court house scene featuring fervid  group-think  supporters, could be seen as another signal of social strife in America at the turn of the century   marked pointedly by the polarizing corruption of the 1992 L.A. riots, the gross federal negligence of both the Ruby Ridge incident and the Waco siege, as well as the heavily publicized Menendez murder case (the strange and salacious trials of Lorena Bobbit and Tonya Harding) and the show trial of O.J. Simpson, an all-time ratings bonanza   not counting the 95 million who watched Simpson s car chase on live TV.Interestingly though, the choreographed bombing of the World Trade Center (1993) carried out by FBI handlers and federal informants, was a curiously under reported event at the time. Which could be a reason for its absence from the media montages seen throughout NBK.The volatility of the 1990 s, proved to be an ideal backdrop for NBK, a picture made during a wave of high-profile sensationalized crime. MOTEL MAYHEM    The murderous  bride and groom  conjuring the death of Mickey s innocence at the Lodge. Later on in NBK, with symbols fully on display, we see close camera shots of the pair s tattoos   Mickey s light and dark Yin and Yang symbol and crudely drawn Christ-like tattoo are contrasted against Mallory s scorpion ink, as they ride along to abduct a hostage. As they make their way to the neon-lit Log Cabin Lodge, there very well could be a subtle reference to Freemasonary, when we witness the ritualistic behaviour shown at the  Lodge.  Stylistically, the motel resembles something out of the macabre cinematic world of David Lynch.In the background while Mickey and Mallory are on the motel bed, projected images on a window pane range from clips of raging dictatorships, to a young Mickey haunted by his father s suicide and a pale horse   recalling the book of revelations once again. All of this takes place while a violent torture scene from the Hollywood film Scarface (written by Oliver Stone) plays out on the TV in front of their hostage.When love turns dark, Mickey and Mallory argue as time-lapse imagery of a Pray Mantis is seen   symbolizing the need for contemplation during their chaos. The two separate briefly, as shamanic chanting cascades over their turbulent night crimes with visions of terror projected onto the sides of buildings.Whether its quick cut edits of opposing and often disturbing montages mixing vitriolic live action, clever special effects, absurdly horror filled projections or startling animated graphics reminiscent of Pink Floyd s The Wall  NBK is a conceptual master work.As the hallucinogenic and often kinetic film progresses, a massive manhunt for the deranged Knoxes is launched by Detective Jack  Super Cop  Scagnetti, a masochistic vigilante law-man (Tom Sizemore) who has his own repressed demons to contend with, which manifest in his psychotic behavior towards prostitutes.We later learn that Scagnetti s mother was gunned down by the infamous shooter Charles Whitman at the University of Texas in 1966.  ROADSIDE SHAMAN    The Knoxes come face to face with themselves during Red Cloud s vision.Shifting mood once again, we hear the haunting piano-driven History Repeats Itself  by A.O.S, (named after the 60 s counterculture chemist and sound engineer, Augustus Owsley Stanley III) which atmospherically plays in the background as Mickey and Mallory high on hallucinogens, are lost, out of gas and at odds with one another. This is the first time Mallory questions Mickey and nature of events that led to her becoming a spree killer.While looking for gas, the Knoxes approach Red Cloud and his grandson, first passing by Jacob (four-horned) sheep, revealing another biblical reference with the presence of the rare breed of sheep guardians. This is another significant scene in NBK, as the sovereign Oglala Lakota activist Russell Means, adds unique depth to the sequence playing the Navajo, Warren Red Cloud (perhaps a reference to US Marine Mitchell Red Cloud).Once inside Red Cloud s hut, the inner turmoil of the Knoxes is exposed. We then learn that Red Cloud served in the Vietnam War, reminding one of the staged Gulf of Tonkin false flag that led to the war. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the ability to militarily engage in a full-scale conflict with North Vietnam, was made possible due to the fabrication of a crime.During the latter half of the Vietnam War, the development of controversial counter-terrorism techniques was at the utmost importance for then Director of the CIA, William Colby. One such program materialized named The Phoenix Program (Operation Phoenix), which employed various terror tactics to destabilize the North Vietnamese leadership, claiming to have eradicated the Vietcong through the use of psy-ops, extortion, the release of criminals and random targeting of civilians to achieve its aims. Some geopolitical critics believe that this template for destabilization has been used in Afganistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria in recent years.Given that Stone himself was a Vietnam veteran in the US Army, we can view that the deliberate inclusion of Red Cloud s service record was a significant aspect to the story, perhaps reflecting the false premise that the Vietnam War was based upon.  SKIN-WALKER    Mickey s inner demons come to the surface prior to killing Red Cloud.The pivotal scene with Red Cloud dramatically altered the emotionally unhinged killers, who were taken on a shamanic journey and forced to face their own reality during a cleansing ritual involving chanting, fire and snakes. Here Mickey s torment and abuse comes to the surface with vivid drug induced flashbacks and after being haunted by his past, he awakens and shoots Red Cloud. The tragic death of Red Cloud, is the first time both Mickey and Mallory feel the weight of their actions.With an axe to grind against mass murders Mickey and Mallory, Scagnetti, manages to apprehend the pair in a dramatic shootout at the Drug Zone pharmacy after they were bitten by rattlesnakes following their quasi-spiritual pilgrimage conducted by Red Cloud. While observing the Drug Zone s logo we see the Caduceus image (winged staff wrapped with two snakes) often inappropriately used in medicine, as it is said to be the conductor of the dead.  DRUG ZONE    subconscious slogans envelop Mickey in the Drug Zone shootout with police. This neon green filtered scene also represents the poisonous consumer culture, as Mickey and Mallory, drugged and snake bitten, stalk to store for anti-venom like the walking dead. Mike Smith s energetic cartoon animation is also featured, as the pharmacist ID s the pair while watching Gale s American Maniacs. Mickey revels in his newfound celebrity catching himself on TV, before he and Mallory are taken in by Scagnetti.  WATCHTOWER   Charles Whitman opened fire on the 27th story of the University of Texas clock tower on August 1st, 1966 in one of the most well-known mass shootings in American history. (Image Source: hartford courant)Scagnetti later hatches a scheme to kill Mickey and Mallory with the fast-talking neurotic Warden Dwight McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones), who plans his own twisted brand of justice inside the riotous Batonga Penitentiary. When Scagnetti s plot fails during NBK s prison riot scene, Mallory executes him in her cell.Scagnetti s fictitious link to a well-known true crime, merges the illusory world of NBK with the UT shooting, subconsciously grafting fantasy onto a traumatic event. In effect, the concept mimics the way news stories sometimes strangely and unexpectedly overlap within a blended hyper-reality of fact and fiction.In recent years, there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the Smith-Mundt Act was effectively rendered obsolete by US lawmakers on July 2nd 2013, as confirmed by RT below: Until earlier this month, a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the US Department of State to share domestically the internally-authored news stories sent to American-operated outlets broadcasting around the globe. All of that changed effective July 2, when the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations. The Smith-Mundt Act has ensured for decades that government-made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the US. An amendment tagged onto the National Defense Authorization Act removed that prohibition this year. There has been an unprecedented increase in propaganda over the years, despite claims that the NDAA provision offered more transparency to the American public.On another note, there are other uncanny historical elements associated with NBK Fresh off his fame from the hit sitcom Cheers, Woody Harrelson was an intriguing choice to play the character Mickey Knox, as it emerged that his father Charles Harrelson, was a contract killer linked to organized crime. Charles was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named Sam Degelia Jr in 1968. Later in 1981, he received two life sentences for the murder of US District Judge John H Wood.   THREE TRAMPS    Charles Harrelson (ID d by forensic experts on the left) is believed to be one of three arrested in Dealey Plaza after JFK s assassination in 1963. (Image Source: jfkmurdersolved)It has been stated that after a six-hour  suicidal  standoff with police in 1980, Charles, apparently  high on cocaine  admitted to killing Judge Wood, while also claiming to be involved in President John F. Kennedy s assassination.When considering the Harrelson-Kennedy connection, the 1989 book Crossfire comes to mind.Crossfire, written by the well-known researcher Jim Marrs, was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful Oliver Stone film JFK. Below is a passage from Crossfire, as it relates to the apparent Harrelson-Kennedy link: Aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire, Harrelson   the father of actor Woody Harrelson   had a long history of involvement with Dallas underworld characters linked directly to Jack Ruby. Continuing, the Crossfire also stated: The late Fort Worth graphics expert Jack White, who testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, already had noticed the resemblance of Harrelson to the youngest tramp. In a 1981 interview with Chuck Cook, Harrelson claimed to have the  biggest story  the reporter would ever have, when questioned about Kennedy s death. Additionally, Jo Ann Harrelson noted the  similarities  between the tramp photos and her husband. All this coupled with the fact Diane Lou Oswald (the mother of Woody), who had also been married to Charles Harrelson in Midland, Texas, made for a strange background concerning the JFK saga.Throughout 1981, more questions materialized regarding the assassination of Judge Wood in a UPI article, as Defense lawyers maintained [Charles] Harrelson was framed by police and the informant.  Charles an ex-felon, said a friend, Hampton Robinson III, who failed to show up to testify, had driven the car. He suggested someone, possibly federal agents, had planted the guns so he could be arrested. He denied telling [Department of Public Safety agent] Pagel he carried a gun. Below, in a KDFW-TV interview in 1982, Charles Harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing Kennedy   but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the US government s involvement in the death of Kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in America.The interview is a startling revelation, adding to the enigmatic JFK mystery and in the process   provides another strange backdrop to NBK Do you believe Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy alone   We ll get back to that   alone, without any aid from a rogue agency of the US government or at least a portion of that agency? I believe your very naive if you do.    Charles HarrelsonOn Independence Day in 1995, Charles along with two other inmates, Gary Settle and Michael Rivers, tried to escape from Atlanta Federal Penitentiary   later surrendering after warning shots were fired by guards.  ENTROPY & ECSTASY  - NBK s mass murder mayhem hits prime time TV.Fragmented Psyche, the Death Drive & Mind ControlWhen exploring the concept of Sigmund Freud s Death Drive and its relation to NBK, we should consider a thoughtful essay by Jon Mills entitled  Reflections on the Death Drive.  Here we can gain a better understanding of the tension at play within the psyche of Mickey and Mallory: Freud did not argue that death [thantos] was the only aim of life, only that it maintained a dialectical tension in juxtaposition to a life principle under the ancient command of Eros, yet the two forces of mind remained ontologically inseparable. In this relational age, the death drive appears to be a drowning man. Through this analysis, we can see the tug of war within the main characters of NBK   caught within a life and death cycle.Also observed throughout the nonlinear narrative of NBK, are the media mobs and throngs of onlookers mesmerized by the murderous duo s violent deeds during the course of the film, arguably revealing a Schadenfreude (joy derived from the misfortune of others).In essence, the abused become the abusers within the fragmented framework of NBK. This twist to the story pushes the observer into accepting and perhaps identifying with the malevolent turn of the Knoxes because of their own flawed and tragic upbringing. This reality is recognized in the rise against perceived corruption (particularly law enforcement) in the form of social justice group think.However, this is where the film purposely presents a false paradigm to those subconsciously seeking their own radical retribution   something which further fractures the viewer s perception by utilizing stereotypical patterns or in this case violent molds to excuse the rampage carried out by Mickey and Mallory Knox.This type of false paradigm forms a preconditioned response in favor of vigilantism; preventing the viewer s ability to see things in an unbiased way, which induces a type of cognitive dissonance in passive audiences, blocking one from considering a rational outlook in the aftermath of trauma.These concepts are central to understanding the nature of NBK, as it stirs questions about morality, societal behavior and the role played by both media and the public in an ongoing celebration of violence. In this sense, we can view NBK s excessive use of trauma-based imagery as statement about the modern age, a culture perpetually inundated by destructive media programming.In many ways, mind control abuse is heavily present within the topsy-turvy world of NBK. However, its presence in the film should be seen not necessarily as an indoctrination of the viewer but perhaps as a warning to those unaware of the psychic assault on their senses from all kinds of media.The film is laced with references to Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), conjuring the CIA s mind-warping military backed program, MK-Ultra, an illegal project that used hypnosis, sensory deprivation and other forms of torture to coerce an individual psychologically. This is represented in the film s main characters, as they vacillate between periods of ultra-violent behaviour and delusional wishful daydreaming, something which reflects a complex background of abuse.Here s an in-depth ABC news documentary examining Project MK-Ultra and the role played by Scottish-American psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron The heart of MK-Ultra is also seen in the controversial paper entitled From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory , written in part by the avowed satanist Michael Aquino, a high ranking security official, who was stated to have been inspired by Lieutenant Colonel John Alexander s article on  pyschotronics,  the employment of extrasensory perception, the transmission and reception of information via the mind.NBK s use of disturbing content might be best understood through its critique of mass media and the larger role that media has played in forcing trauma-based imagery on the public in a manner similar to that of covert military projects. In other words, NBK s volatile imagery is meant to be a savage attack on media itself and should be observed as a critique on media abuse as a whole   not something that overtly supports cruelty.Other aspects of abuse are also present in NBK, whether it s Mallory s unseen abuse by her father Ed, the hostage held captive by the psychotic pair at the  Lodge  motel or Scagnetti s deranged and vile coping mechanism for his own tragic upbringing.Towards the end of the film, under a Stockholm Syndrome spell, crack reporter Gale, attempts to transform himself for the sake of Mickey and Mallory. This later leads to his demise, when he discovers he s not truly a natural born killer. We see the camera capture the action  to tell the tale  of Mickey and Mallory one more time. In the film s final surreal sequence, we see Mickey and Mallory driving in an RV as parents. The idea here is that the Knoxes represent a future society, a future nuclear family, one without traditional moral values, transformed by the death of American culture. This is something which is echoed by Leonard Cohen s song The Future at the end of the film.  PRISON BREAK    Mickey waxes poetic until a prison riot is sparked after talking to Gale. During the prison scene, Stone enlisted some 200 hardened criminals for the realistic riot scene.Cult Crimes & The Daily ShooterWhen concerning America s cult crimes, investigative journalist Maury Terry, and his book The Ultimate Evil, comes to mind. Winding down a dark and treacherous path, Terry s research uncovered the dark details about the so-called Helter Skelter killings, also known as the Tate-LaBianca murders, the  Son of Sam  shootings and other bizarre ritually crafted murders cascading across America from the 1960 s throughout the 1980 s.In an article published by Los Angeles Magazine, writer Michael Bendrix, discussed Terry s controversial book and the  web of terror  surrounding the apparent satanic ritual abuse (SRA) cult cases connected from coast to coast: Although Manson and David Berkowitz never knew each other, they both belonged at different times and on different coasts to the same umbrella satanic-cult organization, called the Process. The Process Church s dark history (splintered off from Scientology), also recalls the Temple of Set church, a reboot of Anton Levay s Church of Satan, as well as Jim Jones and the People s Temple. Interestingly, Jones  friend Dan Mitrione, was an operative trained in  advanced counterinsurgency techniques,  working with both the FBI and CIA, adding to the prevailing mystery of the Brian Jonestown massacre.According to the researcher John Judge, Jones, once a poor preacher, started People s Temple after meeting Mitrione. Judge uncovered much of the media manipulation in the aftermath of the Brian Jonestown massacre. Much of which, was used to besiege the American public through a distortion of facts   something that we see reflected in many high profile cases today.In the arresting book Programmed to Kill by writer and researcher David McGowan, we see an examination of the American media and government agency propelled serial killer saga in a chapter entitled The Myth of the Serial Killer. Here is a passage that directly relates to the narrative of NBK and in some cases, crimes occurring in America today: Most Americans are probably familiar with what is considered the classic serial killer  profile.  This was a notion first put forth by the venerable FBI, which coined the term  serial killer,  and pioneered the concept of  profiling,  in an alleged attempt to understand the phenomenon of mass murder. It appears to be the case though the concept of the  serial killer profile  was put forth largely to misinform the public. In the case of Henry Lee Lucas, few if any of the elements of the serial killer profile apply. For instance, serial killers are said to act alone, driven to do so only by their own private demons. So far removed from ordinary behavior are their actions that they would not, indeed could not, share their private passions with others. In Henry s case, this is a patently false notion. It has been officially acknowledged that Lucas worked with not just one, but at times as many as three accomplices Later, McGowan links the CIA s politically motivated counter-insurgency campaign within Vietnam (Operation Phoenix) to a domestic version (Operation CHAOS) of terror, featuring serial killings throughout the 1960 s, in order to create a climate of fear to push for a police state crackdown.The CIA s Operation CHAOS  collected substantial amounts of information on domestic dissidents from 1967 to 1973,  as admitted by the CIA.Over 40 years ago, a horrific crime spree took place sometime between 1972 -1974 that was dubbed the Zebra Murders. It was a shocking crime spree that shook the San Francisco area to the core.The murders were supposedly refered to as  Zebra , because the radio communications channel that police talked over was channel Z. Reportedly, four Black Muslim men calling themselves the  Death Angels were spawned from a known cointelpro hangout, Nation of Islam.The Death Angels were said to have shot future Mayor of San Francisco Art Angos. Some researchers on the subject have suggested that the Death Angels were trained counter-intelligence assassins tasked with fomenting a race war in America.In the 1990 s the idea of the  lone  serial killer phenomena faded into the background, exploding with the revamped media-driven image of the mass murder around every tabloid corner. When the decade came to a close, tabloid news produced the ratings that networks like ABC, CBS and NBC were starving for. The news world changed after the O. J. Simpson trial, opening the door for larger outlets to run the type of sensational TV programming previously reserved for popular shows like A Current Affair, Hard Copy and Inside Edition   everything from salacious  soft feature  celebrity pieces, to murder stories and courtroom dramas such as Divorce Court and Judge Judy seeped into regular television fair.Similarly in the world today, the public has become reprogrammed by the fear-based odyssey of the  War On Terror  era and in more recent happenings such as the barrage of Daily Shooter mass casualty incidents rippling across America and Europe in the form of Gladio-style operations, we see another phase in the assault on reality. These cases have risen to the forefront in media as there is only a passing footnote concerned about serial killings, largely due to the public s desensitization.This new kind of  crimescape  injects the collective hive mind with a host of socio-political concerns over race, religion, reform and security, while obscuring the forensic synopsis of a crime itself.The notion that serial killers have in fact not acted alone under the  lone wolf  banner, coincides with findings about many of today s mass-shooters, who in a number of cases covered here at 21WIRE, have involved multiple suspects, actors and drills. Most recently in America, the events surrounding the Orlando Pulse night club were called into question, as eye-witness accounts suggested multiple suspects in the alleged lone wolf attack and that the authorities themselves may be to blame for some of the apparent deaths.Additionally, back in 2013, the alleged Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen, was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months (interviewed three times by the FBI between 2013-14) having worked for one of the largest security firms (G4S Secure Solutions, headquartered in Jupiter, Florida) in the US and around the world since 2007. The firm was formerly part of a CIA-linked government contractor and security firm, Wackenhut Corporation. Mateen s extensive background with G4S, reveals another yet another curious connection between security and terror.When discussing the mass shooter phenomena as it relates to terror and security, writer and researcher Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis, stated the following: The purpose of organized black op events is the psychological warfare effect of mass shootings.  All warfare is psychological warfare, as the intent of the attacking party or army desires to bring about the acquiescence of the enemy. Warfare itself is merely a tool to bring about the psychological submission of the other side, while the intention of wiping out the enemy forces are secondary.  Why deplete one s own forces and resources if the enemy can be molded to think accordingly? In this sense, terrorism is the purposeful display of chaos and fear that arises from the radical disturbance of the normal, daily patterns and social routines of the enemy with the intent of achieving an alteration in the psyche of the target populace. Indeed, as critical pieces of Daily Shooter events come together  evidence often suggests a highly organized and coordinated event involving many players. Those players then craft the three dimensions of how we are to view the event   carrying out the event are as follows: members of the police and security services, and most crucially, members of the global media. The last and most important group provides the fourth dimension of this reality, and that is you the public.How you view any questionable event   is the pinnacle for the architects of any impressive psy-op.A fifth dimension is based on the fourth, which is how the architects and social engineers observe your reactions to the event. From this, data is collected, social media is monitored, then metered, opinions are analyzed, and public reactions are measured. The conclusions will be used to form the baseline and design of future  shock and awe  operations reacting directly to the public s response.  CASTING CRISIS    Media fed madness hits the front page.Reality RebornIn an exploratory essay entitled  Critical Theories of Mass Media: Then and Now,  written by Paul A. Taylor and Jan Ll. Harris, we can see clearer role of NBK and how it relates to the modern era: The  shock  of the modern urban environment is figured in terms of a welter of new micro-perceptions, disorientating cuts and contingent images a realm of experience that also characterizes the cinematic experience. Cinema thus trains the sensorium and helps the subject adapt to this new technological social reality. While NBK covers some dark and sometimes philosophical territory, it often hints at something much darker than our imaginations can comprehend. In this sense, the viewer feels like a guilty voyeur in a culture of violence, reliving trauma gratuitously through the callous and obsessive lens of mass media.In the past critics and media have accused NBK itself of giving rise to  copycat  crimes as well as the Columbine High School massacre, and the Dunblane massacre. But interestingly, these two high profile shootings from the 1990 s have a number of questionable elements forensically, such as conflicting eyewitness testimony and how they were apparently carried out.NBK can be thought of as an ultra or hyper-reality, an unreality more real than reality. While critics of the film cite NBK s dangerous content and presentation, it employs a heavy dose of artificial reality in order to inject certain universal truths about the nature of man and media. In an article for Ceasefire magazine, Andrew Robinson deconstructs Jean Baudrillard s hyper-reality. A concept prominently observed while watching NBK: Hyperreality is a special kind of social reality in which a reality is created or simulated from models, or defined by reference to models   a reality generated from ideas. The term has implications of  too much reality    everything being on the surface, without mystery;  more real than reality    too perfect and schematic to be true, like special effects; and  para-reality , an extra layer laid over, or instead of, reality. It is experienced as more real than the real, because of its effect of breaking down the boundary between real and imaginary. It is a  real  without  origin or reality , a reality to which we cannot connect. In an informative piece by Randy Laist, Ph. D., entitled,  Murder and Montage: Oliver Stone s Hyperreal Period,  we see a complex blended reality at play during NBK: Mickey and Mallory are the icons of the new reality: the image ripped out of its context, the innocent killer, the fictional character roaming free across the video prairies of the new manmade nature.  Natural Born Killers elicits our own complicity with the cultural tendency it satirizes, blending critique with enactment in a way that collapses the border between character and audience as well as between moralistic valuations of guilt and innocence. In this perpetual age of terror, highly sophisticated methods are used to alter, distort and reform the public mind. NBK was able to pull back the curtain on mass media s scripted reign READ MORE ALTERNATIVE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood Files",Middle-east,"August 13, 2016"
 Betsy DeVos: Black Colleges That Came From Jim Crow Are Models Of ‘School Choice’,"Donald Trump s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, doesn t just have trouble with grammar. Apparently, she struggles with American history as well.Following Trump s meeting with the leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), DeVos sent out a tweet that can only be described as completely clueless. According to the new education secretary, HBCUs are pioneers of  school choice. Wowwowwow. These paragraphs are from a real, official US Department of Education statement from Betsy DeVos released today. pic.twitter.com/I2FDZfzdmt  Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) February 28, 2017DeVos couldn t have gotten things more backward if she had tried. Historically black schools aren t models of  school choice.  In fact, it is the exact opposite. These schools arose because there was no choice. Slaves were forbidden from learning how to read and write. Following their emancipation, most white schools refused to let black students in.The first HBCUs were started to educate black teachers so that black children would have a shot at receiving any type of education at all. Later, in addition to the private institutions that had been founded, southern states set up public colleges to serve blacks rather than integrate existing schools.If DeVos really believes this is something to aspire to, it certainly does explain a lot. As secretary of education, she plans to  fix  our  broken  education system by diverting federal funds from public schools to private schools, which are largely unregulated. Critics argue that this will serve only to accelerate the resegregation of American schools.Following the integration of public schools in America, white parents who didn t want their children to share classrooms with black students opted to send their children to private schools. In the decade following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, approximately half a million white students left public schools for private ones.Maybe DeVos isn t just an idiot with no understanding of history after all. Between her tweet and her vision for the future of American schools, we are forced to ask if taking our children and their education back to the days of Jim Crow has really been her intention all along.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"March 2, 2017"
AWESOME! Conservative Artist Crashes Anti-Trump Art Show…Shocks Liberal Crowd,"Our favorite conservative street artist Sabo crashed an anti-Trump art exhibition in Los Angeles Saturday night, displaying a work of art of his own to the astonished crowd:VIDEO: SABO HOISTS THE MAGA   JOLLY ROGER AT SHEPARD FAIREY'S ART EVENT ""DAMAGED."" https://t.co/g4QbtnMqWh  unsavoryagents (@unsavoryagents) November 13, 2017If you re not familiar with Sabo, he is a fearless artist whose edgy artwork gets the point across in a BIG way! The sign below reads: THE DEPLORABLES MAGA 2020Remember the artist, Shepard Fairey, whose optimistic  Hope  poster of Barack Obama went viral in 2008? There s no denying that the Fairey poster raised Obama s cool factor a few notches with the artsy LA crowd and the urban hipsters. We guess you can say that this artist is a little responsible for the  HOPELESS  8 YEAR TERM OF OBAMA SABO CRASHES OBAMA ARTIST S NEW EXHIBITION:Well, he was debuting his new exhibition,  Damaged,  Saturday night in L.A. According to HuffPost, the show is his largest to date and features printmaking, sculpture, painting, mixed media, collage, and more.For a guy who preaches against capitalism, this Obama artist sure is making lots of dough Sabo even called him out on it in a series of tweets below. Fairey is milking his Obama-fame for every last drop he can get from the liberal elitists in Hollywood.Fairey reportedly created his  We the People  series specifically to protest President Trump: The state of our society is damaged,  Fairey stated at a press preview of the exhibition on Friday.  I know it sounds pretty dire, but acknowledging that we need to do better is the first step. Sabo, for one, believes Fairey needs to do better . MINE WAS THE ONLY REAL PUNK ART THERE,  the street artist proclaimed on Twitter Sunday. He added that his MAGA flag was taken down after about 30 minutes.  SABO SAD,  he said.  MAGA   MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! Sabo also tweeted:  THERE WERE SO MANY D***** BAGS AT THE SHEPARD FAIREY SHOW LAST NIGHT. IF YOU HAD DROPPED A BOMB ON THE SHOW 3/4 OF THE YOUNG D***** BAGS IN LA WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. Fairey, a critic of the  underpinnings of the capitalist machine,  admitted to capitalizing off of his art.  I critique capitalism   yes, I am selling prints, but yes I am also giving some away,  he said at a press event Friday.Via: PJMedia ",left-news,"Nov 13, 2017"
 Americans Tar And Feather King Donald For Demanding Gold Carriage For Trip To England,"America does not have a king. America is not a monarchy. But Donald Trump apparently thinks otherwise and the American people are NOT happy about it.When President Obama visited England for the first time, he declined the gold-plated carriage the Royal family offered for his use during the state visit, opting instead to ride in a motorcade. The motorcade was not only easier to provide security for, it was less expensive and demonstrated that Obama was truly a man of the people.Donald Trump, however, is demanding that the horse-drawn gold-plated carriage be rolled out for him and that a parade be organized down the Mall to Buckingham Palace in October.Of course, we all know that Trump is NOT a man of the people no matter how much he makes that claim. After all, we re talking about a man who continues to live in a gold-plated penthouse in Trump Tower.Trump literally thinks he s a f*cking king and he is demanding to be treated like one even though the Constitution makes it clear that such titles of nobility are not recognized in this country.The cost of security is going to be massive and it s the American taxpayers who are going to be picking up the tab.As news of Trump s ridiculous demand spread, Americans took to Twitter to virtually tar and feather him in the public square of social media.While enjoying the spoils of stealing an election, The Trump Royal Crime Family requests a gold-plated carriage ride with the Royal Family. https://t.co/uRSrPoULCD  UNITE & FIGHT (@stopthenutjob) April 15, 2017@kurteichenwald They should give Trump his ride on gold carriage   off a cliff.

" Trump Whines About Late Night Hosts Making Jokes About Him, Accuses Them Of Conspiring With Democrats","Donald Trump put on his tin-foil hat and raged at Late Night television hosts on Saturday morning.Late Night television shows have seen a resurgence this year, especially The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which has gotten more popular since Trump took office.Of course, after all the bullshit Trump has said and done over the last nine months, comedians have enough material to keep them busy for years to come.But Trump is now whining about being the main joke on Late Night, and he even threw a temper tantrum accusing them of conspiring with the Democrats.Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very  unfunny  & repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017Seriously, Trump literally complained that Democrats aren t being mocked equally.The problem is that Trump has been nothing but a giant punchline.He has embarrassed himself and America and everything he says and does is a joke. America has become an international laughingstock.There s also this thing called the First Amendment. You know, that constitutional right giving comedians the ability to joke about anything they damn well please.In other words, Trump cannot force comedians to stop making fun of him.You never heard President Obama whine about being joked about on Late Night comedy shows. But President Obama is an adult who is able to take a joke, while Trump is thin-skinned and petty.As for  equal time,  Republicans usually dominate the Sunday news cycle and Fox News is clearly not  fair and balanced.

 WH Starts Condensing Intel Briefings Into Tweet Form In Desperate Move To Get Trump To Read Them,"Donald Trump s obsession with Twitter and inability to concentrate on any concept more complex than a sentence or two is now being put to use by his desperate staff.Trump is about to embark on a high-stakes, crucial sitdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Europe. Unfortunately for America, he cannot concentrate on learning anything before he goes. Trump is infamous for refusing to read intelligence briefings (or read anything, really), but his lack of focus has only gotten worse as his poll numbers slide and his petty fights with morning show hosts and his golf trips consume most of his days.His frantic staff is down to one last move to get him to read a few facts before sitting down with Putin. What follows is one of, perhaps, the most pathetic things you ll ever read.Here s what sources told the LA Times about how Trump s team is getting the president to read up on the adversary who interfered in the 2016 presidential election just months ago:The profile, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations, is part of a thick binder prepared for Trump. The president often doesn t read the usual briefing books and relies on in-person briefings, the officials said, so aides also have written a list of tweet-length sentences that summarize the main points Trump could bring up with Putin.Having thoroughly killed the reputation of the White House in a variety of ways, Trump now isn t even expected to read anything longer than a tweet. And his Republican allies in Congress don t seem to find anything wrong with that.There is a growing sense, both in Washington and around the country, that the executive branch no longer functionally exists. Trump watches an estimated 5 hours of television a day. He tweets at his enemies, sometimes using memes created by racists and which made their way to his desk in mysterious, disturbing ways. He visits his properties and golfs. The rare time staff can get him to actually work on something gets derailed by Trump s incessant ego and casual obliviousness. His staff is now encouraged to bring up Trump and his election win as often as possible. They are told to not contradict him when he says something factually untrue. Sometimes he ll leave Fox News running in the background while his staff tries to conduct business.Even that was too much work, apparently. Now he needs 140 characters or less or his mind will wander to right-wing memes and personal attacks on his enemies. And he appears to be getting worse.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"July 5, 2017"
 Trump Embarrasses Himself By Calling Accurate New York Times Story ‘Fake News’,"Donald Trump posted his most embarrassing attack on the New York Times yet on Friday.Proving once again that he really should think before he tweets, Trump reacted to a New York Times article that accurately reported that he hadn t spoken to Chinese President Xi Jingping since November 14th.Ever since Trump took a phone call from Taiwan, and basically treated Taiwan like a legitimate nation, China has not been happy. It has been American policy for decades that the president does not communicate with Taiwan because China considers Taiwan part of the real China.The  One China Policy  has been a crucial agreement between China and the United States, but Trump blew that all to hell with a single phone call and has been escalating confrontation with China ever since.The New York Times published a story on Thursday before Trump spoke with China s president to end the silence between them.Again, let s be absolutely clear. The new York Times published this story BEFORE Trump talked to Jingping. Once the Times learned of Trump s phone call, the story was updated to reflect the new information. However, it does not change the fact that up to that point, Trump had, indeed, not spoken with Jingping since November.But Donald Trump is not much of a reader, so instead of reading the updated version, he caught the older version of the story and promptly lost his shit on Twitter over it.The failing @nytimes does major FAKE NEWS China story saying  Mr.Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov.14.  We spoke at length yesterday!  Donald J.

Ben Rachinger (@BenSRachinger) February 10, 2017Seriously, Trump could done a simple search to find the updated version of the story but he is so petty and thin-skinned that he immediately lashed out instead of getting all the facts.And the fact is that prior to their conversation yesterday, Trump had not spoken to Jinping since November 14th, meaning the New York Times article was accurate and they continued to be accurate when they updated the story.Trump owes the New York Times a public apology.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 10, 2017"
RETIRED COP PENS Gut-Wrenching VIRAL Letter To 49er’s QB Colin Kaepernick…THIS IS A MUST READ!,"It s easy to see why this letter went viral. Bravo Officer Chris Amos bravo!An Open Letter to Colin Kaepernick,Dear Colin guess you have been pretty busy these last few days. For the record I don t think any more or less of you for not standing for the National Anthem. Honestly, I never thought that much about you, or any professional athlete for that matter, to begin with. I ve read your statement a few times and want you to know I am one of the reasons you are protesting. You see I am a retired police officer that had the misfortune of having to shoot and kill a 19-year-old African American male. And just like you said, I was the recipient of about $3,000 a month while on leave which was a good thing because I had to support a wife and three children under 7-years-old for about 2 months with that money. Things were pretty tight because I couldn t work part time. Every police officer I ve ever known has worked part-time to help make ends meet.You know Colin the more I think about it the more we seem to have in common. I really pushed myself in rehab to get back on the street, kind of like you do to get back on the field. You probably have had a broken bone or two and some muscle strains and deep bruising that needed a lot of work. I just had to bounce back from a gunshot wound to the chest and thigh. Good thing we both get paid when we are too banged up to  play , huh? We both also know what it s like to get blindsided. You by a 280- pound defensive end, ouch! Me, by a couple of rounds fired from a gun about 2 feet away, into my chest and thigh. We also both make our living wearing uniforms, right? You have probably ruined a jersey or two on the field of play. I still have my blood stained shirt that my partner and paramedics literally ripped off my back that cold night in January. Fortunately, like you I was given a new one. Speaking of paramedics aren t you glad the second we get hurt trainers and doctors are standing by waiting to rush onto the field to scoop us up. I m thankful they get to you in seconds. It only took them about 10 minutes to get to me. By the grace of God, the artery in my thigh didn t rupture or else 10 minutes would have been about 9 minutes too late. We also have both experienced the hate and disgust others have just because of those uniforms we wear. I sure am glad for your sake that the folks who wear my uniform are on hand to escort you and those folks that wear your uniform into stadiums in places like Seattle!I guess that s where the similarities end Colin. You entertain for a living, I and almost 800,000 others across this country serve and protect. Are there some bad apples within my profession? Absolutely and they need to be identified and fired or arrested! But you know what, the vast majority do the right thing, the right way, for the right reason. Did I mention that seconds before I was shot, an elderly African American gentleman walking down the sidewalk, turned to my partner and I as we rode past and said,  Get them.  Get who you ask? The thugs terrorizing an otherwise good and decent neighborhood, home to dozens of good, decent African American families trying to raise those families in communities not protected by gates and security guards. No these folks and families depend on America s Law Enforcement Officers.Colin I have buried 7 friends, killed in the line of duty and three others who have committed suicide. I have attended more funerals than I care to remember of neighboring departments who have lost officers in the line of duty, during my career. Law Enforcement Officers with different backgrounds, upbringings, and experiences united by their willingness to answer the call to protect and serve their fellow citizens.Colin I am sorry for the endorsement deals you may lose and the dip in jersey sales, but please know you will NEVER lose what these men and women and their families have lost. And so whether you stand or sit during the National Anthem means very little to me. As for me and the men and women on whose team I was privileged to serve, we will put on our ballistic vests, badge, and gun, kiss our loved one s goodbye, for some tragically for the last time, and out into a shift of uncertainty we will go. We will continue to protect and continue to serve and we will be standing at attention Colin, not just for the playing of our National Anthem, but far more importantly for the playing of Taps.

"NEW “Fair Share” App, “EQUIPAY” Allows Users To Split Restaurant Bill Between Guests, Based On Gender, Sex and Race","A Socialists dream!  Now you can check your privilege at the door. With the Equipay app, you ll never have to walk away from a restaurant with friends wondering if you paid your fair share It s a huge dilemma for progressives: on the one hand, it s terribly patriarchal for a man to pay for a woman s dinner. On the other hand, the gender pay gap of feminist mythology holds that women only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. So isn t the failure to pay just another contribution to structural sexism?Equipay, a new app for Android and the iPhone has a solution. Developed by San Francisco-based  comedian  Luna Malbroux, the app divides bills between dinner guests according to their race and gender. For example, black women, who allegedly make just 64 cents on the dollar compared to white men, would only pay 64 per cent of their share of the bill.According to the app s website,  Equipay helps you avoid the entrenched discrimination that exists in our society. It doesn t split the bill equally it splits it equitably. You pay what you should to balance out the wage gap. The app is free to use   unless you re a member of a  high-privilege group.  Then there s a surcharge. As the site explains:  When dining out with a high privilege group, Equipay automatically adds an EquipayItBack Surcharge. This fee subsidizes meals for others and funds Equipay s charitable arm. Thanks! Last but not least, the app allows users to let their followers know whenever they ve used the app to smash the patriarchy at the dinner table. In a live presentation of the app, Melbroux described how a user,  Graham  shares his Equipay-powered purchase on social media  to show that he is a social justice ally. Of course, having informed the world of his use of Equipay, it remains to be seen if  Graham  will ever be invited out for a meal again.The app won first prize at San Francisco s  Comedy Hack Day,  which brings  comedians, developers, and designers together.  However, Melbroux insists that the app isn t a joke. In an interview with Care2, she expressed hopes that the app would start a serious conversation:  I hope that this, more than anything, starts a discussion and helps people to start thinking a little bit differently about how we can use more technology and more innovation to address inequality and wage inequality. For the rest of us, the app s social media sharing function will give us a useful list of people to never invite out for dinner.  Via:Breitbart",left-news,"Feb 24, 2016"

 Obama Pens Letter Explaining Exactly Why He’s Doing His Job When The GOP Isn’t,"After the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, many have been left wondering who will fill his staunchly conservative shoes. Republicans have made it their mission to prevent any person President Obama appoints from getting anywhere near the Supreme Court, even going so far as to say they won t remotely consider anyone until a new president is in office. However, President Obama knows that it s his constitutional responsibility to appoint someone into the role, and it s a responsibility he takes very seriously.In a post to the prominent SCOTUSblog, President Obama lays down why he s still going forward and appointing someone, why he ll be appointing them, the qualities he s looking for in a Justice, and expects Republicans to follow through with their constitutional duty as well.He writes: The Constitution vests in the President the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court.  It s a duty that I take seriously, and one that I will fulfill in the weeks ahead.It s also one of the most important decisions that a President will make.  Rulings handed down by the Supreme Court directly affect our economy, our security, our rights, and our daily lives.Needless to say, this isn t something I take lightly.  It s a decision to which I devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful deliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of both political parties, and people across the political spectrum.  And with thanks to SCOTUSblog for allowing me to guest post today, I thought I d share some spoiler-free insights into what I think about before appointing the person who will be our next Supreme Court Justice.First and foremost, the person I appoint will be eminently qualified.  He or she will have an independent mind, rigorous intellect, impeccable credentials, and a record of excellence and integrity.  I m looking for a mastery of the law, with an ability to hone in on the key issues before the Court, and provide clear answers to complex legal questions.Second, the person I appoint will be someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary s role; who understands that a judge s job is to interpret the law, not make the law.  I seek judges who approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice, a respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand.But I m also mindful that there will be cases that reach the Supreme Court in which the law is not clear.  There will be cases in which a judge s analysis necessarily will be shaped by his or her own perspective, ethics, and judgment.  That s why the third quality I seek in a judge is a keen understanding that justice is not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook.  It s the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom; experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times.  That, I believe, is an essential element for arriving at just decisions and fair outcomes.A sterling record.  A deep respect for the judiciary s role.  An understanding of the way the world really works.  That s what I m considering as I fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court.  And as Senators prepare to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to consider the person I appoint, I hope they ll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the Court can continue to serve the American people at full strength. President Obama will be doing his job, hopefully Republicans will choose to do theirs as well.Featured image: Flickr",News,"February 24, 2016"

 REPORT: Team Trump Ordered Border Patrol To Defy Members Of Congress In Original Muslim Ban,"The roll out of the first version of Donald Trump s bigoted Muslim ban was nothing short of chaotic. People were arriving in America, only to be turned around and sent back, or detained. Even green card holders were stopped at ports of entry into the nation. There were even photos of children and elderly and disabled people being handcuffed. It was one of the most horrifically un-American moments in this nation s history. Now, new reporting from the Daily Beast shows that that Trump administration s plans regarding the implementation of this ban were even more sinister.It seems that this was the first trial balloon for Trump s intention to bypass a co-equal branch of government, as his people at the ports of entry were told to ignore judges and members of Congress trying to cut past the chaos created by Trump. Instead of letting these people do their jobs, Border Patrol agents were told to ignore them. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) says of these revelations: I m extremely troubled that CBP [Customs and Border Protection] employees would be instructed by superiors to ignore Congressional representatives trying to do their job, especially under such circumstances. We suspected as much at the time, but it s jarring to see it in black and white. I ll be seeking more information from CBP on this matter. These disturbing developments come via a leaked email from Todd Owen, of the Customs and Border Patrol Commission said to his people at the ports of entry: As stated on the call earlier today, you and your staff are NOT to engage with the media or Congressional representatives at this time. Please make sure your subordinate Port Directors are following this direction. Please report any such requests to acting AC[REDACTED] from Congressional Affairs. Thank you.

 GOP Sent Armed Agents To Harass Clinton Aide And Used Your Tax Dollars To Do It,"Republicans in Congress used tax dollars to send armed agents to harass a former aide to Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the never-ending fishing expedition into Clinton s emails.Bryan Pagliano was a tech aide who helped to set up the server for Clinton s emails, and has made top Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee angry because he is asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuses to testify.It is unclear why they need his testimony. The FBI and Department of Justice have already determined that Clinton s use of the email server does not warrant prosecution.But Republicans on the committee decided to flex their muscle anyways:But when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoenaed Pagliano last week, his lawyers said he would again assert his Fifth Amendment rights. They added that he was willing to meet with the committee in private to make that assertion, but was unwilling to do so under the glare of television cameras in a public event.That prompted Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) to dispatch the armed marshals with a fresh subpoena last Friday, Chaffetz revealed in Thursday s hearing. To clear up any ambiguity created by Mr. Pagliano s six lawyers about whether they would confirm service of the prior subpoenas   which they refused to do   we had the U.S. marshals personally serve him,  Chaffetz said.The political stunt was slammed by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) who said,  This served no purpose but to harass and intimidate Mr. Pagliano. The chairman ordered this action in secret, without even notifying Democratic committee members of his plan.  No consultation, no debate, no vote. Republicans have sought to use their control of congress as a government funded super PAC to attack Clinton. In addition to her emails, Republicans have created multiple committees investigating the attack on U.S. personnel in Benghazi. All of these committees have cleared Clinton and President Obama of wrongdoing, but the GOP leadership insists on wasting more and more money on these cases.And it is all financed by taxpayers.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 24, 2016"

LEAKED DOCUMENTS: GEORGE SOROS GAVE 600K To Pro-Refugee Groups To Influence “Attitudes”," Leaked documents from left-wing financier George Soros s Open Society Foundations continue to reveal the extent to which the group has influenced the political response to Europe s refugee crisis. Internal documents show OSF used $600,000 in reserve funding in March 2016 to bring pro-refugee positions into the  political mainstream. Jordi Vaquer, OSF s regional director for Europe, approved a $600,000 proposal entitled,  Countering the anti-migrant rhetoric and toxic narratives surrounding migration in Europe. According to OSF documents, half of the $600,000 would go towards lobbying efforts. All $600,000 came from OSF s  Europe Reserve Fund. A summary of the proposal notes that  the proposed reserve fund allocation will allow for additional resources to be allocated towards countering xenophobic attitudes in Europe, move parts of the political mainstream towards more pro-refugee positions, and build constituencies around a more progressive approach to migration and asylum.

 Samantha Bee BLASTS GOP Over ‘C*ckblocking’ Of Obama’s SCOTUS Nominee (VIDEO),"Full Frontal host Samantha Bee is NOT one to mince words. She took the GOP to the woodshed in the latest episode of her show because of their refusal to even consider President Obama s nominee to replace deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. The worst part of it is that it is a blatant ploy to keep the highest court in the land tipped in favor of conservatives, because, by all definitions, the nominee, Merrick Garland, isn t even a liberal. He s a centrist. Granted, he d rule with common sense and he isn t a flaming bigot, so, by GOP standards, that makes him further left than Bernie Sanders.Bee railed them, saying: Why are you c*ckblocking this gentle law Hobbit? She then went on to take half-melted Reagan dummy from Madame Tussaud s wax museum  Ted Cruz, as well as other GOPers to task for referring to President Obama as a  lame duck.  Bee said: Jesus Christ, he s not a lame duck. He s three trimesters away from lame duckery. A president s term is four years; you can t say three of them are legitimate and the fourth is garbage. They re not Indiana Jones movies. Finally, the hilarious host pointed out the huge gamble here: they can either go with Garland, or they can wait for Hillary Clinton to nominate   a transgender Black Panther abortion doctor  or for Donald Trump to go with   a pile of Maxim magazines. Either way, they lose BIG.Bee is beyond right here, of course. This is just the GOP playing politics, trying to take President Obama s right and duty to do his job in his last year in office away.

 Fuming Trump Calls His Colorado Loss ‘The Biggest Story In Politics’ After Cruz Wins All 34 Delegates (TWEETS),"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump does not lose gracefully. In the past, he s threatened riots and violence if he were to lose the GOP nomination, but now that Ted Cruz is starting to close in on him, the business mogul is upping the ante.After a humiliating loss in Colorado, where Cruz took every last one of the state s 34 delegates, Trump is whining about the  crooked  and  corrupt  way America chooses party nominees. Ever the sore loser, Trump cried foul because Cruz was able to get all of the delegates  support, even though residents couldn t vote. Calling this perceived injustice  the biggest story in politics , Trump complained that the  people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians.  And of course, he made all of these accusations over his favorite news platform   Twitter: This unusual nomination process in Colorado state was explained by The Denver Post last year: Colorado will not vote for a Republican candidate for president at its 2016 caucus after party leaders approved a little-noticed shift that may diminish the state s clout in the most open nomination contest in the modern era.The GOP executive committee has voted to cancel the traditional presidential preference poll after the national party changed its rules to require a state s delegates to support the candidate who wins the caucus vote.The move makes Colorado the only state so far to forfeit a role in the early nomination process, according to political experts, but other caucus states are still considering how to adapt to the new rule. But Trump really can t get over it. Trump complained even more while speaking to thousands at a rally in New York yesterday, insisting that the GOP nominee should be whoever wins the most votes, not delegates. Trump said: What they re trying to do is subvert the movement with crooked shenanigans. We should have won it a long time ago. But, you know, we keep losing where we re winning. This morning, Trump continued to b*tch and moan on Fox & Friends. He said: I ve gotten millions   of more votes than [Sen. Ted] Cruz, and I ve gotten hundreds of delegates more, and we keep fighting, fighting, fighting, and then you have a Colorado where they just get all of these delegates, and it s not [even] a system. There was no voting. I didn t go out there to make a speech or anything. There s no voting. He also called some of the ways candidates try to win delegates  crooked : They offer them trips   they offer them all sorts of things, and you re allowed to do that. I mean, you re allowed to offer trips, and you can buy all these votes. What kind of a system is this? Now, I m an outsider, and I came into the system and I m winning the votes by millions of votes. But the system is rigged. It s crooked. Clearly, Trump has forgotten all about that time he bribed former candidate Ben Carson with a job so the retired neurosurgeon would endorse him. Talk about  crooked. Whether Trump likes it or not, he s going to have to play by the rules and if he doesn t the nomination is going to keep slipping away from him. He s going to have to appeal to delegates instead of people like his easily influenced racist, misogynistic supporters. Trump delegate chief Paul Manafort reports that Trump is going to implement a strategy similar to what Cruz has been doing. Manafort said: A more traditional approach is needed and Donald Trump recognizes that. In order for Trump to get enough delegates to get the Republican nomination by June 7, he will still need to win 60% of the remaining delegates. Right now, Trump is winning 45%. According to the Associated Press, Trump has 743 delegates compared to Cruz s 545.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"April 11, 2016"
DETECTIVE ON SETH RICH Murder Mystery Drops Shocking News [Video],"Rod Wheeler was on Hannity last night with startling information on the Seth Rich murder mystery. He spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, ""i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated."" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.  RTWhile Wikileaks  Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger, he brought up the death of Seth Rich. Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation:Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27 year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.Reporter: That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn t it?Julian Assange: No. There s no finding. So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below:Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death. He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC. His parents say he was,  Making sure everyone who wanted to vote, had the opportunity :Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently, Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest, with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance, where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump, and said that  anyone  within the Democrats  organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers, Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders.

BOOM! Trump Exposes Phony Michelle Obama…When She Went LOW With Oprah…Trump Went HIGH…Very High [VIDEO],"Michelle Obama told Oprah Winfrey in her final interview as our divisive First Lady, Now we re feeling  what not having hope feels like.  Sadly, for Michelle Obama  hope  for her is strictly based skin color.  When her husband Barack Obama was being received like a rock-star across America (by mostly white supporters), she admitted that she suddenly found herself feeling pride in America for the first time in her adult life. Now that Donald J. Trump is about to become our next President, she openly admits to Oprah that she s lost all hope. Michelle has spent much of her 8 years as First Lady speaking about and obsessing over skin color. Many of the accusations she s made about white people in America are inaccurate and divisive, yet she curiously depicts herself as a victim during her interview with Oprah where she whines that Americans accuse her of being,  An angry black woman.  Michelle never bothers to acknowledge that her hateful, racist rhetoric has helped to earn that title, and not the color of her skin.Trump responded beautifully to her implied criticism of him by saying,  I assume she was talking about the past and not the future. I actually think she made that statement not meaning it the way it came out.  Ironically, Trump actually stepped up and saved her from making herself look like,  An angry black woman.

BREAKING HIDDEN VIDEO Exposes Racist Dems Comparing Black Republicans To Jews Who Helped Nazis [Video],"A longtime Clinton ally and donor has a theory about black Republicans: They re like the Jewish guards in concentration camps who tried to save their own skins by helping the Nazis kill Jews. In a hidden-camera video released Wednesday by Project Veritas Action, author and academic Benjamin R. Barber compared black Republicans to the  Sonderkommandos  during a Sept. 19 fundraiser for North Carolina Senate candidate Deborah Ross. He described the Sonderkommandos as  Jewish guards who in effect helped murder Jews in the camps so they could live a little longer.   So there were even Jews who were helping the Nazis murder Jews. So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously f***ed in the head,  said Mr. Barber in undercover footage. Mr. Barber, a Rutgers University professor emeritus and City University of New York senior research scholar, isn t some fringe figure: He served as an informal consultant on civic affairs to President Bill Clinton, wrote a book about the Clinton administration, and donated to Hillary Clinton s presidential bids in 2008 and 2016.Read more: WT",politics,"Nov 2, 2016"

In spite of substantial public controversy, very little reliable data exists concerning the frequency with which non-citizen immigrants participate in United States elections. Although such participation is a violation of election laws in most parts of the United States, enforcement depends principally on disclosure of citizenship status at the time of voter registration,  Richman and Earnest note. We find that some non-citizens participate in U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections. Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress,  they continue.The authors later say that the number of non-citizen voters  could range from just over 38,000 at the very minimum to nearly 2.8 million at the maximum. Richman and Earnest s study has been contested by other social scientists and was the subject of a rebuttal article challenging their findings. That study, led by Harvard political scientist Stephen Ansolabehere, claimed instead that  the likely percent of non-citizen voters in recent US elections is 0. The Trump White House has faced criticism over President Donald Trump s belief that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has declined to offer any evidence to back up his claim. The president does believe that, I think he s stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him.  press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday. Spicer did not cite any specific studies to back up Trump s belief.The White House has not yet returned an email from The Daily Caller regarding whether or not Richman and Earnest s study was part of Trump s belief that  millions  of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election and   if not   what other studies make up the basis of Trump s belief.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Jan 30, 2017"
 Trump Begins Day Of Diplomacy By Escalating Hot War With The Press (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is supposed to have several important phone calls with world leaders today, amounting to what is being billed as a  day of diplomacy.  Given Trump s inexperience and impulsive statements, world leaders are especially skeptical of what his being leader of the free world (*SHUDDER*) will really mean for the world. So, one would think that he would spend his morning preparing for his calls, right? WRONG.Instead, Trump is up and tweeting, when he is, as of this writing, set to be on a call with the Prime Minister of Japan at any moment. His target? Why, the press, of course. The Washington Post and the New York Times have been on Trump s hit list for quite some time, and that thorny relationship has gotten worse, since Trump s White House is leaking like a sieve regarding his temperament and inability to do his job as president. It was the Washington Post who said Trump s team is portraying him as a  clueless child,  which of course enraged the thin-skinned sorry excuse for a  president.  To that end, Trump fired off a series of tweets doing his best to discredit those outlets:The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election. FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017Thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017 dwindling subscribers and readers.They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course, and never will. DISHONEST  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017So, in other words, Trump is proving the aides who are leaking the details of his alarming behavior to the press right. He is clueless, dangerously impulsive, petty, and acting like a child. In fact, they are likely leaking this information to the public in a desperate attempt to make Trump behave like a world leader rather than like the man baby that he is, since he gets all of his information from the cable news shows.Whatever the reason, keep the leaks coming, folks. The American public   and, indeed, the press   need to keep the pressure on Trump and let the nation and world know just what a dangerous fool is currently occupying the Oval Office.#RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"January 28, 2017"

RARE INTERVIEW WITH WHITE HOUSE SECRETARY: Bill Clinton Had Affairs With “thousands of women”…”Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made”,"This is a mind-blowing interview that confirms much of what many of us suspected about the Clintons. For some, it may be even worse than what they believed to be true. Kudos to Linda Tripp for agreeing to do this interview. People who cross the Clinton s do usually fare too well In a rare interview, Linda Tripp, a pivotal figure in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, revealed on Sunday it was common knowledge while she worked in the West Wing that Bill Clinton had affairs with  thousands of women. Speaking on  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  Tripp for the first time divulged that she personally knew another White House staffer aside from Lewinsky who was also having an affair with Clinton. That unnamed staffer was mentioned by Tripp in various depositions but she has not spoken about it publicly.She charged that Hillary Clinton not only knew about her husband s exploits,  She made it her personal mission to disseminate information and destroy the women with whom he dallied. Tripp says she cringes at the sight of Clinton presenting herself as  a champion of women s rights worldwide in a global fashion, and yet all of the women she has destroyed over the years to ensure her political viability continues is sickening to me. Tripp documented evidence of Lewinsky s phone calls about her relationship with Bill Clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. She explained to Klein that she did so because she believed her own life and Lewinsky s were in danger, saying that Lewinsky was threatening Clinton with outing the relationship.Tripp also used the interview to criticize what she says is the news media s unwillingness to investigate the Clintons. She singled out and thanked Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report, declaring that without him  things would have been very, very different. Drudge s website was the first media outlet to break the Lewinsky scandal after Newsweek sat on the story.Tripp had unique access to the Clintons because her office was directly adjacent to Hillary s second floor West Wing office for the entire time she served in the Clinton White House from 1993 to the summer of 1994 with the exception of the first three months of the Clinton administration, when she sat just outside the Oval Office.Tripp s nonpartisan position was a carryover from the George H. W. Bush administration in which she served. Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made She told Klein that her role in the Lewinsky case followed  years of alarm at what I had seen in the Clinton White House, particularly Hillary and the different scandals, whether it was Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Vince Foster. All of the scandals that had come before and were so completely obliterated in the mind s eye of the American people because of the way all of them were essentially discounted. So I watched a lying President and a lying First Lady present falsehoods to the American people. So my dismay predated the January 1998 period when the Monica Lewinsky scandal surfaced. To me it was very important that the American people see what I was seeing. My years with the Clintons were so disturbing on so many levels. Tripp maintains that she went public with the Lewinsky evidence to ensure the intern s safety as well as her own.She told Klein:I say today and I will continue to say that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took. That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends.I think that had it not become public when it did, particularly in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, which was coming to a head with President Clinton s deposition, that we may well have met with an accident. It s a situation where unless you lived it as I did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation.Tripp said the young Lewinsky, 21-years-old when she entered the White House as an intern, was unaware of the danger that she faced.She described Lewinsky as a  young girl, smart, clever   but in this one area she was blinded and she fancied herself in love. He fancied himself entitled. It was nothing more than a servicing agreement. She romanticized that there was an affair. And when it didn t pan out the way she had hoped it would   he had promised her he would bring her back to the White House as soon as the 1996 election campaign had finished. When he didn t, she essentially lost her mind and started acting in erratic and frightening ways. Threatening the president.There came a point in July of 1997 when she not only threatened to expose the affair, as she referred to it. But also she at that time informed him that I knew all about it. So at that time it became dangerous for Monica and for me. This was something that absolutely could never see the light of day. And she never realized the implications of threatening a president or her behavior. And I did.Tripp told Klein that  the biggest fallacy that most people believed is that this was a unique occurrence. Monica was somehow special. And regrettably that s the farthest thing from the truth. She said,  Everyone knew within the West Wing, particularly those who spent years with him, of the thousands of women. Now most of your listeners might find that difficult if not impossible to believe. And I can tell you in the beginning I felt the same way. But let me be clear here. This is a pattern of behavior that has gone on for years. And the abuse of women for years. Asked whether Clinton was having affairs with others in the West Wing, Tripp replied,  I know that to be true. One in particular who I will not name told me this herself. But as to the hundreds or thousands, remember I worked closely with the closest aides to the president. And it was a loosey-goosy environment so there was not a lot of holding back. So it was common knowledge, let s put it this way, within the West Wing that he had this problem. It was further common knowledge that Hillary was aware of it. Tripp described the tense West Wing atmosphere between what she characterized as two almost diametrically opposed Clinton camps.The dynamic between the two groups   the Bill Clinton people and the Hillary Clinton people. It was as though they were almost opposing forces. But I can tell you that the one with the power and the one that instilled the fear in the other was the Hillary camp.And the [Bill] Clinton people would cower if she were coming into the area, just as an example, of the Oval without notice. There would be scurrying around to make sure there was no one in the wrong place at the wrong time, shall we say. It was a fascination to see the amount of energy that was expended covering up his behavior. It was horrifying.Tripp said Hillary personally targeted Bill s female conquests and accusers, with the future presidential candidate exhibiting behavior that is  egregious and it s so disingenuous. In my case, for instance, right after the Lewinsky story broke, she was heard directing her staff to get anything and everything on Linda Tripp. So the defamation of character and the absolute assurance that my credibility would be destroyed began right away. And it happens with any woman who is involved in any way, either with him in a physical relationship or an assault or anything that can endanger their political viability.Tripp recalled Hillary s January 27, 1998 appearance on NBC s The Today Show in which she was seen as standing by her husband while blaming the Lewinsky scandal on a  vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. She didn t do it in an honest way,  said Tripp of Clinton s NBC interview.  Instead she lied, which didn t surprise me. And I will give her credit. She is enormously effective. And became a victim. A wife who was betrayed. This is someone who had no real personal problem with any of this behavior. The problem was in it becoming public. They had to continue to become electable  She was the more aggressive one in ensuring that the political viability was not endangered in any way. Tripp told Klein that Hillary  does not possess integrity on any level. I just wish that your listeners could know the person that I knew. Because if they did there is not a chance she would be elected president. Tripp s ringside seat afforded her rare insight into the scandals of the 1990s and perhaps alleged wrongdoings to come, with the West Wing employee personally witnessing behavior that may have foreshadowed Clinton s email scandal, in which she is accused of sending classified materials through her personal server.Tripp said she noticed major differences in the manner in which classified material was handled by both the Clinton and Bush administrations in which she served.President George H.W. Bush s administration had  a completely different way of operating on every level, including on classified and secret material,  she said.She continued:All the regulations were followed, right down to a cover sheet being essential if the document had had any sort of classifications. The securing of classified documentation in safes. The burn bags that were used if any sensitive material was to be disposed of. All of this was familiar to me and followed every security protocol that I had experienced in the past.When the Clintons came in this was one of the things that I found appalling right from day one. And it went hand and hand with the disdain for the military. The military was present in the White House in the form of presidential aides. The aide that carried the nuclear football, just as an example. And in the Bush White House they were respected, as they should be. In the Clinton White House, they were disdained. To see it treated this way and to see these people treated this way was disturbing.Tripp referred to Clinton s private mail woes as  classic Hillary Clinton in a nutshell. She gets to decide what she does. Look, the rules don t apply to the Clintons. If you understand that basic premise you understand the Clintons. For Tripp, Clinton s use of a private server was  all about control. She has a need to control every single aspect of her life. And you know anyone in government knows that any key stroke on a keyboard within a government agency belongs to the government  it is not up to the employee on any level to control what happens to it for posterity.

MUSLIM TEENS Stage Fake Terrorist Attack In MN Movie Theater…Guess Who They Blame?,"Oh and as an added bonus, according to one of the Muslim teens, they snuck into the theater as well In addition to faking hate crimes against themselves, Muslims are now resorting to staging fake terrorist attacks to prove how Islamophobic America is. First there was Clock Boy in Texas, then The Muslim Hipsters in Arkansas, and now it s the Muslim Movie Goers in Minnesota. A group of Muslim teens did their best to make movie theater patrons think they were about to launch an attack with some purposely-suspicious actions recently.It turns out the Mall of America isn t just a place for angry black protesters; it s also a great spot for creating a false Islamophobic response. The City Pages reports that on January 1st a group of African Muslim teenagers, possibly from Somalia, went to a movie at the country s largest mall. They were all carrying backpacks and speaking with heavy accents and foreign tongues. They wanted to be noticed.Once the movie began, the 5 or so black Muslims got up and separated, taking seats away from each other. As you can imagine, the rest of the people in the theater thought this was a pretty unusual thing for them to do. In fact, most of the other moviegoers thought these Muslim teens were about to launch a jihad right then and there.Reportedly, as many as 15 movie patrons left the theater and called the police, fearing that radical Islamic inspired bloodshed was eminent. The police and mall security arrived and detained the Muslims. They explained to the officers that they got up and moved away from each other because they didn t want to be tempted to talk to each other during the film, which sounds like a complete load of shit.One of the Muslims, Akram Oromo, took video of the cordial police officers questioning him and his co-conspirators and posted it to his FaceBook page. He also pointed out how racist this intrusion was:Racism well never stop ima let u know that because this white people though this young Muslim teens going to blow up the movie theater because we all have a backpack. More than 15 whites start running from the theater like we about do some stupid shit they called police and moa security but they didn t find anything from usAccording to the video, in addition to freaking people out, Oromo and his friends also snuck into the movie without paying.// <![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]>Racism well never stop ? ima let u know that because this white people though this young Muslim teens going to blow up the movie theater because we all have a backpack.

Radical Islamic groups have actually called for a hit on the Mall of America. It is not racist or Islamophobic for people to react to obvious Muslims acting in a very suspicious manner. That is called vigilance. Even Muslim apologist Barack Obama has said that Americans should keep their eyes open and report anything that doesn t seem right as a way to combat terrorism.It s my opinion that these Muslim teens did this on purpose with the goal of triggering a police response so they could cry about the unfair treatment they receive in the US. Terrorism is evolving, but so too is hate crime hoaxing. It s really quite simple: go to a public place, do something technically legal yet terribly suspicious, then sit back and reap the liberal media sympathy.Via: DownTrend",left-news,"Jan 8, 2016"
NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN? NAVY SEAL TEAM That Killed Osama Bin Laden To Take Part In Military Drills Against N. Korea,"A WARNING shot has been fired at North Korea by the Trump administration. There s a new sheriff in town and North Korea s crazy little dictator may need to rethink his antagonistic behavior. He may be poking the wrong tiger Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Friday it may be necessary to take pre-emptive military action against North Korea if the threat from their weapons program reaches a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson outlined a tougher strategy to confront North Korea s nuclear threat after visiting the world s most heavily armed border near the tense buffer zone between the rival Koreas. He also closed the door on talks with Pyongyang unless it denuclearizes and gives up its weapons of mass destruction.  Chicago TribuneThe US Navy SEAL team that killed Osama bin Laden is reportedly set to join military training drills against North Korea for the first time.Along with other elite US units including the Army Rangers, Delta Force and the Green Berets, SEAL Team Six will take part in annual training exercises alongside South Korean forces, according to Yonhap News. A bigger number of and more diverse US special operation forces will take part in this year s Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercises to practise missions to infiltrate into the North, remove the North s war command and demolition of its key military facilities,  a South Korean official told the news agency.SEAL Team Six would practice removing Kim Jong-un and destroying North Korea s weapons of mass destruction, South Korea s Defence Ministry told the Joong Ang Daily newspaper.North Korea has already warned of  merciless attacks  if the USS Carl Vinson, a US aircraft carrier currently in South Korean waters, infringes on its  sovereignty and dignity even a bit .North Korea has already warned of  merciless attacks  if the USS Carl Vinson, a US aircraft carrier currently in South Korean waters, infringes on its  sovereignty and dignity even a bit .The secretive state last week fired four ballistic missiles into the sea off Japan in response to the annual military drills, which it sees as preparation for war.Both the US and South Korea maintain that the exercises are purely defensive. North and South Korea are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.For entire story: Independent UK",politics,"Mar 17, 2017"
 Trump Can Be Arrested By The NYPD And This Military Veteran Explains Why,"It would be a great sight to behold if a New York City police officer were ordered to place Donald Trump in handcuffs. People would cheer.And it could happen if New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has enough evidence to charge Trump with crimes related to his fraudulent  charity. The Trump Foundation is currently under investigation for self-dealing, which means the foundation paid out donations to its own officers, which is illegal and totally unethical and immoral.Money that should have been used to help cure cancer has instead benefited Trump personally as he has used foundation money to buy stuff for himself, pay legal fees and settlements, and pay executives involved in running the scam.Trump, of course, whined on Twitter about the investigation, claiming that 100 percent of funds go to charities.I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won t report!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016But Trump is lying because even the Trump Foundation admitted to self-dealing in their 2015 tax returns to the IRS.Trump even thought he could escape the legal system by simply shuttering the foundation, but Schneiderman s office informed him that he can t  legally dissolve until that investigation is complete. And if that investigation finds that Trump broke the law, he would be subject to charges and arrest. And as military veteran and blogger David Axe points out, there is precedent for an NYPD officer to arrest Trump and haul his ass to jail. President-elect Donald Trump could be in big legal trouble over his allegedly self-dealing charity,  Axe began.  It s entirely possible that he could eventually face arrest. And it wouldn t be unprecedented if, say, a New York cop actually slapped cuffs on Trump and read him his rights. After all, a ballsy policeman arrested Pres. Ulysses Grant way back in 1866   albeit for a comparatively minor crime. It s not unprecedented for a small-time cop to arrest America s commander-in-chief. In 1866, Pres. Ulysses Grant got busted for riding his horse at an unsafe speed at 13th and M Streets in Washington, D.C. The arresting officer, William West, had previously issued Grant a warning for the same offense. Do you think, officer, that I was violating the speed laws?  Grant reportedly asked West. I certainly do, Mr. President,  West replied.  I am very sorry, Mr. President, to have to do it, for you are the nation s chief executive, but my duty is plain, sir. I shall have to place you under arrest! Do your duty, my good man,  Grant said. West escorted the president to the police station for booking. Grant paid a fine and walked free. Officer and president reportedly became friends after the incident.Yes, this really happened. And stealing money from charities is a hell of a lot worse of a crime than speeding while riding a horse.In fact, the precedent of arresting sitting presidents for breaking the law goes back even further. Franklin Pierce was arrested in 1853 for running a lady over with his horse. The case was dropped due to lack of evidence.But the points stands. Police officers can arrest the president for violating the law and it sure looks like Trump violated it repeatedly.As Axe points out, however, Trump probably won t go quietly. If a New York cop arrests Trump, it seems unlikely that the notoriously temperamental Trump   and his equally angry private security detail   will react as gentlemanly as Grant did to his own arrest,  he concluded.Frankly, Trump should be thrown in a prison cell next to Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff. Because while Madoff only scammed rich people, Trump stole money from kids with cancer to pay his employees and his legal bills. That s truly deplorable.Featured image via Capitol Hill Blue",News,"December 28, 2016"

POLICE OFFICER Asks Daughter’s School To Remove Hateful Drawing From Display…School Has SHOCKING Response,"What do you think about the school s response to this police officer s request?The painting Officer Dave Hamblin found offensive (Facebook)A police officer father in the United States has taken to social media to complain about a piece of artwork displayed at his daughter s school.Kentucky cop Dave Hamblin is outraged by the painting which depicts two black people with a gun pointed at their head.On one half of the painting, under the title  1930 , a Ku Klux Klan member is pointing the gun.On the other half, titled  2015 , a white police officer is shown pointing the gun at what looks like a African American child.The painting was from a school project inspired by racial violence depicted in Harper Lee s book, To Kill A Mockingbird.Police officer Dave Hamblin, who goes by the name Dave Kingmen on Facebook, says the picture is upsetting and creates  future cop haters . We speak of tolerance, we speak of changing hostile environments, we speak of prejudice, and we speak of racial relations, yet, when it comes to hostility toward police, their families, and profiling them through bigotry we are expected to tolerate it,   Kingmen  wrote..  I will not, nor will my child. The cop has asked for the picture to be removed but the school has seemingly turned down his request. When discussing social injustice, people will likely be offended by some topic,  said Tracy Green, a school spokesperson. The drawing is a student s artistic representation based on the lens through which the student viewed that issue and the student has a First Amendment right to share that opinion.

" The Worst Possible Person Just Won Alabama’s Runoff For U.S. Senate, And It’s All Trump’s Fault","Alabama s Republican runoff election for Jeff Sessions  vacant Senate seat has come to its end, and the candidate that will go up against Democrat Doug Jones in December s general election is none other than Roy Moore. Moore is the former chief justice of Alabama s state Supreme Court, and he s the one who ordered all of Alabama s probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court s ruling on same-sex marriage in 2013.But Moore wasn t Donald Trump s candidate. Luther Strange, who has been holding Sessions  seat, was the man backed by Trump. In fact, Trump was at a political rally for Strange last Friday when he called for NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to be fired. The president s endorsement usually helps a candidate, yet it s Moore who just won. Here s a little background on Moore: He was yanked from the Alabama Supreme Court s bench in 2003 for refusing to remove a massive monument to the Bible s 10 Commandments from the grounds of the courthouse. That s considered a violation of the First Amendment since it constitutes a government endorsement of one religion.In 2012, Moore won his job back, then called same-sex relationships  sodomy,  and decried the immorality of it all in the wake of the Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage across all 50 states. He wanted to bar Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison from serving in office because he s a Muslim, and he accused Obama of using our military for social experiments (including wiping out  don t ask, don t tell  and allowing transgender individuals to serve).He has also defended Putin because Putin seems to agree with him on the issue of LGBTQ rights. One might think that would earn him Trump s endorsement, but somehow, it didn t.All of that should have made this election a tossup given conservatives  current love of Trump, but it didn t. Moore was polling ahead of Strange pretty much the entire time. Why?Well, Trump, for starters. That buffoon endorsed Luther Strange and bragged about it all over Twitter, up to and including through today. He boasted that Strange s numbers had skyrocketed since his endorsement, but according to NBC News, Trump s endorsement actually pushed people towards Moore. Trump won Alabama by double digits last year, but it seems they re souring towards him now.That makes this Trump s fault, at least partly. Voters claimed that his endorsement didn t affect them one way or another, but those who were influenced by Trump said he pushed them away from Strange. What that means is that some Republican voters chose Moore because Trump backed the other candidate.That s a massive blow to Trump. Maybe Alabama voters are ashamed of Trump, and they d have good reason to feel that way. For instance, speaking on the  Rick and Bubba  radio show, which is based out of Birmingham, Trump said: Luther Strange is going to be a great Senator. He loves Alabama, he loves the states and he loves the country. He will absolutely win against the Democrat.Ray will have a hard time. If Luther wins, the Democrats will hardly fight. If Ray wins, [Democrats] will pour in $30 million. Moore s first name is Roy. When Rick Burgess, one of the show s hosts, pointed out that he d gotten Roy s name wrong, Trump actually said that it s not a good sign if the president doesn t know his name. Then he said: I don t know that much about Roy Moore. Roy Moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the Democrat.Against Luther they won t even fight. When news of Moore s win came out, Trump tweeted the following:As noted above, the general election is December 12. That tweet has since been deleted, and replaced with one noting the correct month for the general.Where is Trump s influence, then? Rosie Gray of The Atlantic said: The outcome of the special election primary will help answer the question of  who is more influential with Trump s base: Trump himself, or the constellation of powerful voices on the right to whom base voters listen and who are supporting Moore? Well, it seems that Trump doesn t have the influence he thinks he does. Especially given that Strange was likely a far better candidate for Senate than Moore ever could be. Moore is an absolute disaster. He s a danger to the U.S., and in deep-red Alabama, there s very little chance that a Democrat can win Sessions  Senate seat. And Trump s endorsement of Strange is partly responsible for this. He s a blight on the GOP and a blight on the nation as a whole. He s dangerous, and Moore s election is evidence of that.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 26, 2017"
 BET Actress Lays The Smack Down On Obama-Hating Fox News Pundit Stacey Dash,"Fox News pundit and co-host Stacey Dash attracted a lot of negative comments with her recent comments that BET and the NAACP shouldn t exist.Actress Gabrielle Union is the star of BET s Being Mary Jane, and at a recent appearance at the Sundance Film Festival she put Dash s ignorant comments in their place.When asked about Dash s comments at the Sundance Film Festival premiere of  The Birth of a Nation  on Monday, Union first replied,  Who s that? Who s Stacey Dash? Is she like related to Dame Dash? Was she on Roc-A-Fella (Records)? Union said the BET Awards remain necessary because of the lack of diversity in mainstream awards. The more that we focus on inclusion and a true representation of this country, I think that crazy lady will have less to say,  Union said of Dash.Dash s career hit its peak with her appearance in the 1990s comedy, Clueless, and since then she has been far more likely to appear in instantly forgettable direct-to-video movies than anything in the mainstream box office.A few years ago she discovered that there is a niche for her as a black pundit who is willing to attack black America, and began using her Twitter account to boost Mitt Romney s presidential campaign. As that attracted expected pushback from her followers, Dash parlayed that into regular pundit appearances on Fox News, eventually becoming a co-host of the network s rip-off of The View, Outnumbered.On that show, Dash is the reliable source of outrageous, ill-informed quotes, often at the expense of black people to the delight of her Fox News bosses. Sometimes, Dash has even gone to far for Fox, however, and she was recently suspended for saying that President Obama doesn t  give a sh**  about terrorism. Though in reality, the offense for Fox News viewers was probably more that she swore on-air and not that she lied about Obama.Dash has a book coming out this summer about her transition from actress to right-winger, which gives credibility to the suspicion that Dash is in it for the money.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 26, 2016"
 WATCH: Leonardo DiCaprio Gave an Oscar Acceptance Speech That Put Republicans To Shame,"He s one of the most recognizable actors of his generation and he s starred in some of the most memorable movies. Yet, he s never won an Oscar   that is until Sunday night. Leonardo DiCaprio took in Best Actor at the 88th Annual Academy Awards Sunday night for his role in The Revenant. DiCaprio used the moment to highlight an issue that Republicans have refused to acknowledge: climate change. He said:The Reverent was about man s relationship with the world. 2015 was the hottest year in recorded history. Our production team needed to go to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together, and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyp_DVgT260]It was a night already fueled with emotion and tension after the Academy Awards were called out for not having any African American nominees. Lady Gaga later delivered the performance of a lifetime with her song Till it happens to you, from the documentary The Hunting Ground, which explores rape on college campuses in the U.S., drawing tears and a standing ovation from the audience.The acclaimed actor then received his own standing ovation as the winner for best actor and made his speech as Vice President Joe Biden looked on.Many Republicans have rejected the notion of climate change, preferring instead to cater to big businesses and corporations who have polluted the earth and set temperatures to record levels. Climate change is one of many pressing issues that separate Republicans and Democrats and it makes this election year vital for future policies on climate change.

But it sounds like it was sent from someone who worked closely with Lynch, and sent to someone who was very worried about Clinton going down in flames, probably someone very close to Clinton.At the end of the segment, Herridge pointed out that Comey suggested he was boxed in by Lynch and here is what she s talking about: ",left-news,"May 4, 2017"
 Meet The Brave Republican Women Who Are Supporting Clinton In The Boldest #NeverTrump Move Yet,"Donald Trump is an embarrassment to the GOP and, more importantly, to the nation. He is also the most outrageously dangerous major party presidential candidate that America has seen in recent memory   perhaps ever. Well, many people on both the left and the right know this, and have jumped on the #NeverTrump train. Now, there is a very interesting development: a group of women who have been lifelong Republicans doing all they can to elect presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.The group is calling itself  Republican Women for Hillary,  and spent their 4th of July evening holding the first meeting of their fledgling organization at Washington s St. Regis Hotel. These women are definitely not your typical Hillary supporters. One of them admittedly spent copious amounts of time campaigning against abortion rights, and another is a Southern Baptist who is basically against everything Hillary Clinton and Democrats in general stand for. However, their mission is to make sure Donald Trump never gets anywhere near the Oval Office   even if it means doing all they can to elect Hillary Clinton.U.S. Chamber of Commerce employee and staunch Republican Jennifer Lim, who helped found the group, explains the logic: It s really important that Republican leaders, especially Republican women leaders, stand up right now and say we re not OK with Trump representing our party. This is not a position I ever wanted to find myself in. But it s important that when things like this happen that people speak up. It is important to note that this group is in no way affiliated with the Clinton campaign, but they do intend to do their own campaigning and activist activities, including urging people to vote for Clinton, while also helping conservatives facing political backlash for condemning Donald Trump and his destructive, dangerous campaign.Here is the tweet from the group s twitter, endorsing Clinton:We're with her! #GOPwithHer #ImWithHer https://t.co/FhKIaa6BX5  RWFH (@GOPWomenWithHer) June 7, 2016Meghan Milloy, who is a member of Republican Woman for Hillary but also works for a conservative think tank called American Action Forum, seems conflicted and it is clear the decision was not easy to join this group. However, her resolve is solid. She says:  It has been tough for me to come to this point where I can vote for a candidate who has been very against what I ve been working for for most of my professional career. That being said, I can t vote for someone like Donald Trump because he s overtly racist and misogynist.

 Trump Sends Lawyers After 17-Year-Old Girl Over Website Where Kittens Scratch Him,"What happens when a thin-skinned bully becomes President? Apparently, he will even threaten children who hurt his precious little fee-fees.A 17-year-old girl known only as Lucy from San Fransisco created a cute website for her resume that featured kittens punching Donald Trump. Lucy created  TrumpScratch.com  as a  fun little  project. It s pretty simple   users click on The Donald s face to punch him with tiny kitten paws.But her project, which was intended for fun, caused Lucy to fall into a legal nightmare because at his core, Donald Trump is nothing more than a schoolyard bully who can t deal with any form of criticism whatsoever.After the website was live for three weeks, Lucy received a cease and desist letter from Trump s general counsel.The letter calls Trump a  well-known businessman  and informs Lucy that As I m sure you re aware, the Trump name is internationally known and famous. And, of course, as a public figure he opens himself up to criticism   even if it is in the form of a kitten-themed website it took a high school girl three hours to code. I was going to just let this go, but I think it s, pardon my French, fucking outrageous that the president of the United States has his team scouring the internet for sites like mine to send out cease and desists and legal action claims if we don t shut down,  Lucy told the Observer.  Meanwhile, he tweets about The Apprentice ratings and sends out power-drunk tweets about phone tapping. HOW ABOUT BEING THE PRESIDENT? She changed the website to KittenFeed.com, but says  they still came at me. It s so sad that his administration is focused more on being liked, burying real news and taking down sites like mine as they supposedly make him look bad,  she says.You can view her masterpiece here.Featured image via screengrab",News,"March 21, 2017"
BAD NEWS FOR THE SPEAKER: Many Republicans Agree…Trump’s Debt Deal Was Better Than Paul Ryan’s,"Trump knows the art of the deal like no one else! He d had enough of do-nothing Paul Ryan so he went around him and made a better deal with Democrats that actually helps the hurricane victims. The three month deal was much better than the commitment of 18 months that Speaker Ryan had proposed: President Trump shocked and angered Republicans on Wednesday by agreeing with Democrats on a bill to suspend the debt ceiling for three months, but by Thursday, Republican lawmakers and aides were acknowledging that Trump s plan was better for Republicans than the plan put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.Many Republicans weren t all that happy with either proposal. Ryan was proposing an 18-month suspension of the debt ceiling that would have let the government keep borrowing as much as it needed, and said the long time frame was needed to provide for market stability.But Democrats said they could only agree to a three-month suspension since they wanted leverage more immediately for other issues they want to pursue in the coming weeks. Trump s decision to take the Democratic plan was seen by some as a betrayal of Republicans, and a sign Trump was abandoning the GOP on a key legislative package.After the dust settled, however, Republican lawmakers and aides made it clear they saw the three-month plan as a slight improvement over Ryan s plan.The reason was simple.Neither plan involved a commitment to new spending cuts as a condition for allowing more government borrowing, something many conservatives wanted to see. With that key piece lacking, many Republicans preferred a shorter term agreement for the same reason Democrats did: it will let them try much sooner to leverage the next debt ceiling fight for their own policy prescription, in this case, spending cuts.A source with the conservative House Freedom Caucus said that group has not met to discuss the plan that Trump settled on Wednesday. But this source said many members of the group seem to agree that both deals were bad because neither included a commitment to spending cuts. Lots of members think the three-month deal is bad, but so is an 18-month deal,  this source said. But the source added that the shorter time frame will at least let them try again soon, and in that way, is better for Republicans. [HFC] members don t want to sit on their hands,  the source said.HFC members, in particular, see the debt ceiling deadline as a chance to threaten not to vote for an increase in the borrowing limit until spending cuts are included. When the battle heats up again, the HFC is expected to push for a cap on federal spending based on a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product.The HFC is a relatively small group of conservative lawmakers known for clashing with House GOP leaders. The Republican Study Committee, in contrast, is more mainstream and is comprised of most House GOP lawmakers for the purpose of advancing conservative policies.But even the RSC indicated Wednesday that Trump s deal is better for Republicans than what Ryan was pushing. For example, RSC member Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Wednesday that he preferred Trump s plan over Ryan s. I think a short-term deal is much easier to vote for than an 18-month or two-year extension with no offsets,  he said on MSNBC, describing the choices that were put before the GOP. Cole cast the deal Trump reached as a slight delay that will let Republicans try again soon for spending cuts. I think a much worse deal would have been to extend the debt ceiling with no spending cuts,  he added.  So we live to fight another day.

"WATCH: STONE-FACED ANDERSON COOPER Gets Schooled By Trump’s Deputy Assistant On Fake News…”I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings, so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money but that’s not media”","President Trump s deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka appeared on Anderson Cooper s 360 show, where he admonished the network for making up news about the Trump administration being  in crisis  and that they were in  bunker mentality  following the news story that broke about a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian Lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary, but instead wanted to talk about Russian adoptions. Gorka told Cooper, It s laughable. Your chyron talked about a bunker mentality. I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House. It is absolutely nothing of the kind, Trump s Deputy Assistant continued,  We are pushing the  Make America Great Again  agenda, the president is a steam locomotive that cannot be stopped, it s just fake news.

Gorka continued with his tongue-lashing of CNN s stone-faced host Cooper Anderson:  I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings, so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money but that s not media, that s not reportage, it s just fake news. Cooper, remained surprisingly stoic as Gorka outed CNN s real agenda, which is clearly not reporting actual news, but instead, chasing ratings and ultimately money from advertisers. When Gorka appeared to be finished, Cooper replied,  Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it gets us anywhere.

 Millennial And Latino Disgust With Republicans Reaches All Time Highs (POLL),"Say what you want about the GOP but they really don t like half-measures. In the span of just 4 years, they managed to not just alienate themselves from much of their base, they also managed to piss off the two fastest growing voter demographics in the country: Millennials and Latinos.According to polling done by the Pew Research Center, 30 percent of Latinos view Republicans favorably which is surprisingly high considering just how ugly Donald Trump has been. But it s a little less surprising that the unfavorable percentage is at 61. By comparison, the black community has a favorable/unfavorable opinion of 15 percent for and 78 percent against.Just to be clear, the black community has been crucial in several states to electing Democrats. If, or more likely, when, the Latino vote reaches the same levels in terms of turnout and anti-Republican sentiment as the black community, states like Texas and Arizona will turn blue and stay that way. On the other hand, Latinos view the Democratic Party 56 percent for and 36 percent against. Expect those numbers to rise as more Latinos take office with a  D  next to their name.The picture is just as grim for Republicans among Millennials. A whole whopping 35 percent have a favorable view of the GOP and 58 percent of them will pass, thank you very much. The Millennials, in case you didn t notice, recently passed the Baby Boomers in size as the Boomers die off from old age. Sure, they don t vote as often as the Boomers, but they will and soon. That makes them the about-to-be most powerful bloc of voters and they re no fan of Republicans.You might have been thinking that Millennials obviously hate the Democrats just as much. Buuuuuuut .you would be wrong. In fact, of all the generations, Millennials are the only ones the Democrats are above water with: 52 percent favorable versus 41 percent unfavorable. And since over the next 10-20 years, Millennials are going to be taking over the party that DOESN T spew nonstop racism, sexism and anti-gay bigotry, how do you suppose elections are going to go? To the left or to the right?Dear Republicans: Game OverThe only way for the GOP to survive is to attract, Millennials, Latinos and the black community. But the only way to do that is to reject the culture war nonsense that pushed all those groups away in the first place. On top of that, they would also have to reject the constant attacks on the poor and sucking up to the rich. That would drive away both parts of Republican base: The rich and the the terminally stupid. In other words, either Republicans reject everything that the Republican Party has stood for for the last 60 years, or (not so) slowly wither away.What a lovely time to be a liberal.Oh, and just as an afterthought, in case you thought old white people would come to the rescue, they hate Republicans even MORE than Millennials.

" Trump’s Attorney General Says THC Causes ‘Real Violence,’ Indicates Legal Cannabis Crackdown Is Coming","Breaking news out of Trump s White House indicates that marijuana use may have contributed to the violent events at Bowling Green and perhaps even in Sweden.At least, in the opinion of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that could be the case. Despite repeated promises by Trump on the campaign trail to leave states alone that have legalized recreational cannabis, the Trump administration appears to be gearing up to take aim at the legal marijuana industry. On Monday, he told reporters at the Justice Department that  real violence  is connected to cannabis use:Sessions further said that experts have told him there is  more violence around marijuana,  than one would think. You can t sue somebody for a drug debt,  Sessions said, on Monday.  The only way to get your money is through strong-arm tactics, and violence tends to follow that. (Business Insider) I don t think America is going to be a better place when people of all ages, and particularly young people, are smoking pot,  Sessions said.  I believe it s an unhealthy practice, and current levels of THC in marijuana are very high compared to what they were a few years ago, and we re seeing real violence around that. If he was just a tiny bit smarter, he d realize he s actually arguing in favor of legalization. I live in Portland, Oregon. Here s a couple of notes about the recreational dispensary located a convenient four blocks from my house   first, they are a small business. Small businesses aren t in the habit of fronting people inventory; you typically pay for what you re purchasing, and leave. The second point here is going to require a bit of imagination.Let s imagine that they have fronted me untold amounts of cannabis, and I haven t paid. So they send a strongman to my house to get the money and I just call the cops, because weed is legal, I m not incriminating myself by calling, and using  strong-arm tactics  to get money you are owed is illegal. Federal courts aren t going to treat it as a legitimate product, sure, but the answer to that is complete legalization, not wasting millions of dollars in pointless enforcement and court battles with individual states.He said some other genuinely dumb shit as well:Sessions then appeared to criticize a column The Washington Post published Tuesday by Sam Kamin, professor of marijuana law and policy at the University of Denver. In the op-ed, Kamin argues that the opioid crisis is  a reason to expand access to marijuana rather than to contract it.  A 2016 study from Columbia University s Mailman School of Public Health found  adverse consequences of opioid use  decreased over time in states where marijuana is legalized as individuals substituted marijuana for opioids to treat pain.But Sessions scoffed at Kamin s reasoning. Give me a break,  Sessions said.  This is the kind of argument that has been out there. [It s] almost a desperate attempt to defend the harmlessness of marijuana or even benefits. I doubt that s true. Maybe science will prove me wrong.   My best view is that we don t need to be legalizing marijuana. Well, Sessions, science has, indeed, proved you wrong. Your  best view  is both behind the times and demonstrably false. There is so much information out there demonstrating the benefits of cannabis in combating the opiate epidemic and treating chronic pain that if you re the Attorney General, and ignorant of it, it s by choice.It s time for the failed war on drugs to draw to a close. All prohibition of cannabis accomplishes is driving people who self-medicate or are prescribed cannabis for chronic pain to use prescription opiates instead, finances the cartels and fuels violence, and makes the Fox News crowd happy. The  gateway drug  shtick is old and false. Sean Spicer and Jeff Sessions think that increased recreational use of cannabis has led to the opiate epidemic, rather than excessive and improper prescriptions (as evidence shows). This is so wrong and out-of-touch that it shows they have no interest in  actually helping or rehabilitating heroin and oxy addicts   they are only interested in using them as a political prop that justifies attacking rights they don t believe people should have.

Mo Brooks who was on deck when the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team.NBC News Special Report: Congressman Scalise, aides shot at baseball practice in Virginia https://t.co/KD9i1iP9MZ  Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 14, 2017In a statement, Texas Rep.

There was no information on the staffer s injuries.According to both congressional and law enforcement sources, the shooting appears to be a  deliberate attack. Two law enforcement sources say the suspect  is in police custody, has been taken to a hospital.Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice, at a field where they ve practiced for years, when all of a sudden shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.Congressmen in attendance described  an injured Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base and lying there until the shooter was shot. The Congressmen then ran to help him. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went out to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound.

Flake said two members of Scalise s security detail were wounded, and another man was wounded in the chest. Brooks said the shooter appeared to be a white male but added that  I saw him for a second or two.  He said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didn t say anything.

" Stephen Colbert And His Audience Absolutely Pummeled Bill O’Reilly, And It Was Spectacular (VIDEO)","When appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert it s probably best to expect the unexpected. And in the case for Fox News host Bill O Reilly, it was probably best to expect his far right-wing humor to not be appreciated whatsoever by either Colbert or his audience.Within the first few moments of his appearance, he alienated pretty much everyone by saying those over on CNN and MSNBC are  on crack.  He was trying to convince people that Fox News is #1 in the ratings for a reason. Little does he realize that if people want their right-wing hate TV, they only have one place to go, whereas facts are dispersed everywhere else. So when O Reilly made his remark about the other networks, the crowd audibly booed him and was not impressed whatsoever.Then, just moments later, O Reilly thought it wise to do a Bernie Sanders impersonation while also saying that Sanders and Trump are the same person. Here s the thing: Colbert and his audience, are likely going to have a liberal response, so you can only guess how this Sanders bashing was received   not well. Colbert even asking the Fox News host after his Sanders impression,  are you having a stroke? After a huge back and forth about what O Reilly deems best for the nation, and when Colbert explains what actually is best for the nation, they end their debate cordially, but it was obvious the Late Show host was visibly annoyed with the Fox News toady.Colbert ended the interview with this amazing statement: You re a great model to do an impression of for ten years.

" BREAKING: Lawsuit Shows Trump Wanted To Fire, Replace ‘Unattractive’ Female Employees","While Donald Trump and Kellyanne Conway continue to boast about how uplifting and fair the billionaire mogul has been to his female employees (hiring, promotions, large salaries), court documents obtained from the Los Angeles Times paint a more sinister, misogynistic view into how Trump really felt about female employees.In other words, it highlights exactly the kind of person Trump is and just how he treats women.According to the court documents, Hayley Strozier, director of catering at the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, accused Trump of asking managers to fire  unattractive  waitresses and replacing them with  attractive  ones instead:I had witnessed Donald Trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that restaurant hostesses were  not pretty enough  and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women.Other court documents from 2012 document that Trump had asked Sue Kwiatkowski that his premises in Los Angeles should showcase only  attractive  women:Donald Trump always wanted good looking women working at the club. I know this because one time he took me aside and said,  I want you to get some good looking hostesses here. People like to see good looking people when they come in.  I and the other managers always tried to have our most attractive hostesses working when Mr. Trump was in town and going to be on the premises.In Donald Trump s America, a woman is not judged on her merit and ability to get the job done, but by her looks   and if she doesn t have the looks, she s out of a job. Because of Trump s ridiculous and sexist demands, managers were often forced to hire inexperienced, inept employees due to looks over the experienced, capable employees who didn t fit the mold of  attractive  enough.The outrage lies within one caveat: he only did this with female employees, not males. Either Trump thinks all men are drop-dead gorgeous or he really does have a blatant disregard for treating women with respect.And it s not like the ill deeds towards these women did not go unpunished. As part of a  broader labor relations lawsuit  (which includes other complaints than sexist mistreatment), Trump had to compensate:The bulk of the lawsuit was settled in 2013, when golf course management, without admitting any wrongdoing, agreed to pay $475,000 to employees who had complained about break policies. An employee s claim that she was fired after complaining about the company s treatment of women was settled separately; its terms remain confidential.If Trump really treated women with respect, why did he have to give hush money to a female employee who complained about ill-treatment of not just her, but women overall?Maybe someone should tell Kellyanne Conway before the next time she starts babbling on about how great he is.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016"
 SHOCKING New Data PROVES How Effective Gun Control Laws Are (DETAILS),"The liberal  third-world hell hole  (as Ann Coulter calls it) that is California has some of the strictest gun-control laws in the United States, far surpassing Illinois and New York. Naturally, Republicans will use these facts to somehow smear the liberal state as being one that exhibits the most gun violence around   even though red states produce more gun violence per capita than blue.Surprisingly, what many people may not know   and what they won t hear on Fox News   is that California has experienced a sharp decline in gun violence over the last 20 years, putting a fatal dent in the right s scare tactics when it comes to guns and the Second Amendment.Gavin Newsome, California s current Lieutenant Governor, recently spoke at a press conference regarding Prop 63, which limited magazine sizes, banned the sale of assault weapons, and conducted background checks on ammunition sales. It passed on election day by an overwhelming margin. During this press conference, Newsome pointed to a very interesting statistic: since California began passing stricter gun laws in the 1990s, the state has seen a staggering 56 percent drop in gun homicides.Now, those were Gavin Newsome s numbers, and they took into account gun violence rate. If you look at the numbers from Center for Disease Control, between 1993 and 2014 (Newsome s numbers did not include 2014), the rate for murder rate has actually fallen 67 percent, from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. The data for 2015 and 2016 are still being collected, and have not been factored into Newsome s or the CDC s report.Whereas the state s gun laws may or may not be directly responsible   gun rights groups and gun control groups of course have differing opinions, naturally   it remains that the talking point  more gun control harms citizens  has been proven effectively false, in California of all places.It looks like the good guys with the guns may not be stopping the bad guys with the guns. Because guns have increasingly been hard to come by in he state, a trickle effect has been felt.While red states like Louisiana continue to top the list for gun murder and violence, blue states like California have taken action, and are literally saving lives in the process. In raw numbers, 1,233 were killed in 2014 compared to 1993 when 3,183 were killed.For the  All Lives Matter  bunch, this should be cause for celebration, and a big  you were right. The numbers for 2015 and 2016 should further these trends that have been set by liberal politicians. The only thing standing in the way between more un laws and more lives being saved is the NRA.Midterm elections will be here before we know it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"January 8, 2017"
 Donald Trump Whines That Mitt Romney Was ‘Ungrateful’ For Trump Helping Him Lose The Election (VIDEO),"The more we get to know Donald Trump, the more we realize that he s just a big orange version of Kim Jong-Un. He s childish, petulant and thin skinned, and anyone who has wronged him had better watch out. Mitt Romney wronged Donald Trump. He refuses to endorse the billionaire and well, it appears that Trump is holding a grudge against Romney from 2012. Trump wants credit for helping him lose the election, or something like that.On Sunday s Meet the Press, Trump talked about the feud that appears to be happening between the 2012 nominee and the 2016 presumptive nominee. Every single robocall I made, he won that state. Every single speech I made, he won that state, in terms of the primaries. I believe I won him, or helped him win five states that he was going to lose in the primaries,  Trump continued.And that support came with personal cost to Trump. I raised a lot of money for him. I ruined the carpet in my apartments   I had so many people come. We actually had to have two fundraisers because there were so many people. Here s the video:It is true that in 2012, Trump endorsed Romney. As for Trump s argument that he would have taken Romney over the victory line if he accepted more help, well, probably not. At that time, the Trump revolution (or whatever you want to call it) had not yet started. Polls at the time showed that Trump would have been a negative on Romney s campaign.Romney hasn t always been so sour on Trump. After receiving his endorsement, Romney sung Trump s praises in a way that almost sounds like a presidential endorsement.In an interview in March, Trump said that Romney begged him for his endorsement in 2012. Mitt is a failed candidate   he failed horribly,  Trump said.  I backed Mitt Romney. You could see how loyal he is. He was begging for my endorsement. I could ve said,  Mitt, drop to your knees,  and he would ve dropped to his knees. He was begging. He was begging me. It s doubtful that Romney actually begged Trump, but the former candidate does claim that if Trump acted the way then that he does now (he did), then he wouldn t have accepted it:If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 3, 2016If Romney had any of your sympathy, this is where he should lose it. He knew what Trump was about long before 2012. As you recall, during the Arab Spring in 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was persona-non-grata in the United States, Trump rented him a piece of land. His racism was clearly evident in his birther stance and with this tweet in response to Baltimore riots following the death of Freddie Gray. Our great African American President hasn t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2015His views on immigration are hardly new:Stop the EBOLA patients from entering the U.S. Treat them, at the highest level, over there. THE UNITED STATES HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2014And of course, we know that Trump is sexist. None of that is what matters to Romney, though, although Romney does enjoy the illusion of decorum. What matters to Romney is that Trump has no core beliefs. He even flip-flops on how he ll treat his and Romney s own kind, but he does seem to be settling on raising taxes for the wealthy, sort of. That might be just a bit too far for Romney.Featured image via video screen shot. ",News,"May 9, 2016"
FOX NEWS REPORTER ASKS MAYOR Why She’s Using Taxpayer Money To Sue Family For Epic Christmas Light Display [VIDEO],"The drip drip drip of the Left ensuring Christmas is reduced to a quiet nonpublic celebration    This isn t a very good of taxpayer money, going after home owners for a few Christmas lights, is it?  Watters pressed.  I don t think Santa s going to be happy with you. While definitive information about the lawsuit wasn t offered up, Bendekovic did make it clear that she thinks that Watters is in no position to speak for Santa Claus. I don t think you should be voicing your opinion what Santa wants and what Santa doesn t want,  she shot back.According to the Sun Sentinel, the Hyatts have been battling with officials for years over the size and scale of the display, with the city   which considers it a nuisance   filing a lawsuit earlier this year to stop it.After years of arguing with the Hyatts to scale back the display, the city sued this year to quash the spectacle, which officials consider a neighborhood nuisance. A scheduled hearing did not take place over the summer as planned and has not yet been rescheduled.In addition to the lawsuit, the family claims on its official website that it faces $250 per day in fines for continuing the show, citing  government interference  as being at the root of the dispute. Here s a portion of a petition that is posted on the  Hyatt Extreme Christmas  website:By signing this petition, you show your support for Hyatt Extreme Christmas, a 20 year-old tradition, which has been entertaining, inspiring and motivating families from around Plantation and South Florida.The Hyatt s take great joy in creating memories for children both young and old during this special time of year. Our community can see our display of more than 200,000 lights for FREE. We give back to our community by raising awareness and funds for charitable partners such as Humane Society, Broward Food Bank and Support for the Military working with the Red Cross  Holiday Cards for Heroes .Despite facing legal woes, the Hyatts are back at it this year, bringing their display to the masses. The husband and wife duo took Watters through the display, and he interviewed some locals who fully support it. They re just not making money on this and they wanted money from us,  he said, claiming that city officials wanted the family to charge admission for the free display.  When we wouldn t give it to them, all the sudden we re in court. Via: The Blaze",left-news,"Dec 18, 2015"
WATCH INSANE VIDEOS…CHICAGO COP Spills The Beans About What REALLY Happened In Chicago,"The leftist media was quick to blame Donald Trump for the organized chaos and riots that were fueled by paid protesters who, when pressed by FOX News reporters, clearly had no idea why they were there. Jim Acosta, of CNN News, admitted the number of anti-Trump protesters and amount of violence was underreported, but laid the blame squarely on Trump:  Donald Trump, for whatever reason decided to hold a rally, almost in the Lion s Den. the media didn t report that protesters were running through parking lots and breaking windows of cars with Trump stickers on them The protests launched by militant leftists who shut down Donald Trump s Chicago rally were far more aggressive and destructive than reported, says a Chicago Police officer. It seems the [media] aren t broadcasting footage of the debris being thrown across Harrison by Sanders/Hillary supporters at Trump fans,  the officer wrote shortly after the canceled Trump event.The officer, who posed anonymously on the Second City Cop blog, also noted the media didn t report that protesters were running through parking lots and breaking windows of cars with Trump stickers on them, or that the department called out emergency Incident Teams to cope with the anti-Trump riot at the University of Illinois in Chicago.Later that same day the officer posted a second, much longer post, to detail the failures of the police leaders to plan for and respond to the protests.The officer insisted there was  pretty much zero in terms of a unified Command Post  for the event, and that officers had no central command to report to or coordinate response from.This video shows woefully unprepared the Chicago police force was to deal with these well-trained, paid, organized agitators. Note the Palestine flag at the 2:06 mark and person on loudspeaker chant  Allah  at the 2:26 mark: Who wrote this plan?  the officer wrote.  We ve seen and heard reports that UIC was woefully unprepared for this. They had their own people and Monterey Security inside. The Secret Service had a presence, but they re restricted to dignitary protection. The ISP had a squad there. And CPD. So where were the people geared up for a riot? For NATO we had an entire strike force geared up and ready to go. We had the Mounted Unit up and running. Tens of dozens of bikes. Did no one see this coming? [quote_box_center]Radio Host, John Cardillo told his audience today that a trusted police officer friend in Chicago told him this weekend that before the UIC rally 70% of police officers supported Donald Trump. After the rally was called off and GOP candidates sided with the violent mob   90% of police officers support Donald Trump.[/quote_box_center]The officer went on to insist that suddenly emptying the pavilion of Trump fans and  putting a few thousand people out on the street as targets  was a terrible decision. This decision led to many unnecessary confrontations between Trump fans and the anarchist protesters, the officer said. It also led to unnecessary property damage, the officer said.Next came a long list of questions:Who gave up the expressway? Who let them block ambulances? Why did they not assemble citywide Incident Teams as soon as they knew the rally was canceled? Tact Teams? We even heard Mass Arrest kits weren t available and only one transport wagon on scene in case arrests were made.The criticism went farther.Who ever drew up this order failed miserably. Whatever the Intelligence Section was doing wasn t nearly enough. The On Scene Incident Commander failed to anticipate even the best case scenario and every other appointee showed how incompetent they really were by not ordering up more reinforcements and more units on stand-by.Video that hasn t gotten much play since that night also showed that the protests were far more raucous than previously reported.In all, it seems that at least this one Chicago Police Officer felt that the CPD fell down on the job during this incident.

"LORETTA LYNCH Makes Disturbing VIDEO Encouraging Dems To Fight Back Like Those Before Us: “They’ve Marched…They’ve Bled…And Yes, Some Have Died…We Did This Before…We Can Do This Again!”","Obama s former AG Loretta Lynch released a video that s a call to action for Democrats. These people who have been stripped of power after being so close to achieving their goals of fundamentally transforming America into something most Americans wouldn t recognize, are serious about starting a civil war in our nation. If you don t believe me, listen to the words of Obama s former AG, who compares the fight against President Trump and his supporters to that of the Civil War:  I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back.  I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers. (Lynch s statement about the Founding Fathers is quite ironic, considering that she worked hand-in-hand with former President Barack Obama to destroy the very fabric of our Constitution.) It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference.

 BREAKING: Harry Reid Calls Trump ‘Rich Brat’ Who Won’t Release Tax Returns Because He’s ‘Spoiled’,"Donald Trump has one hell of a week. Starting off with his abysmal performance in last Monday s debate and ending with Saturday s New York Times  1995 tax bombshell. Trump is currently being lambasted for his manipulation of the tax system and his refusal to release his tax returns.Harry Reid has joined in with rest of the left and has arguably released the most scathing indictment of Trump on the matter of his taxes so far. Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father, Reid writes in a press release. Despite losing a billion dollars, Trump wants to reward himself with more tax breaks on inherited wealth while stiffing middle-class families who earn their paychecks with hard work. Damn, that s brutal. The U.S. Democratic Senate leader did not stop there. Reid continues, demanding that Trump release his tax returns and spells out very clearly what it means if the Republican presidential nominee continues to refuse to do so. Trump is over-leveraged and deeply indebted to someone, but until he releases his taxes we won t know who. The implications for America s security are severe. The American people deserve to know who has leverage over this man who wants to be president. In the name of the public interest, the Senate should immediately pass the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, which would force all presidential candidates to release their tax returns. If all senators agreed to pass this act for the good of the country, we could pass it in a matter of minutes. If the Presidential Tax Transparency Act were passed, Trump would be forced to release his tax returns. Let s step back and take stock: Senate Republicans have put party so far ahead of country, they ve endorsed a racist, incompetent failure who managed to lose a billion dollars in a boom year,  Reid writes.  Now they are helping Trump hide his tax returns and preventing the American people from knowing what individuals, businesses or foreign interests could have leverage over Trump. It s time we rip open Trump s closet and let the world see the financial skeletons he is hiding. The American people have trusted their officials to release their tax returns voluntarily. Trump is the first person in decades not to release his returns. He has proven that he cannot be trusted. Trump and all other future candidates  tax returns releases should be mandatory. Not only will it will be a small step forward towards a brighter more transparent democracy, it ll also make the financially corrupt think twice before running for office.Featured Image from Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 2, 2016"
 ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Shoots At IHOP Customer Who Told Him To Stop Spewing Racial Slurs,"Early Saturday morning, a customer at a Kansas International House of Pancakes called 911 to report that one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  had opened fire on him for the most ridiculous reason one can think of.According to Wichita Police Sgt. Steve Yarberry, the 31-year-old victim had asked another man to stop spewing racial slurs at the restaurant. Instead of offering a polite acquiescence or even engaging in a spirited debate, the hate-spewing gentleman opted to communicate using the Second Amendment   not the words, but the action. At least one shot was fired in the parking lot of the IHOP. Upon leaving the restaurant, the unnamed victim noticed a black sedan following him. Then   at least three more gunshots rang out. Police believe that the shooter stalked his victim. One of the rounds struck the tailgate of his vehicle,  Yarberry explained. Fortunately the target, who only asked that the man stop acting like a racist douchebag, was not hurt in the attack. He did not know the shooter, the Sergeant says.According to the National Rifle Association, nothing should have impeded the shooter s ability to own and possess a firearm until the very moment he pulled the trigger or committed another crime with the gun. Until that moment, he was a  good guy with a gun,  the last line of defense against a tyrannical government and criminals like himself. But that s the problem    good guys  and  bad guys  look exactly the same, until it is too late, that is.The suspect has still not been identified or apprehended.Featured image via The Wichita Eagle",News,"July 31, 2016"
WOW! MILWAUKEE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING Professor Exposed After Student Takes Photo Of INSANE Test Question: “One Of Main Functions Of Government Is Income Redistribution”,"Socialist indoctrination starts in Kindergarten and is reinforced throughout the American student s educational journey. Parents need to pay attention to the drivel their children are being taught at school. This kind of socialist teaching is not limited to public schools, many of us have discovered that private and parochial schools are equally guilty of this type of indoctrination. Conservative Hollywood actress Sam Sorbo suggests home schooling your children to avoid government indoctrination. The role of government is to redistribute wealth, according to a course at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.A test, administered on April 29 in Professor John Traxler s Healthcare Economics class, told students that  [o]ne of the main functions of government is income redistribution,  then asked them to explain what the statement meant. The correct answer was C:  Taxing the wealthy and giving it to those in poverty. Josh Fisher, a student in the class, told Campus Reform he was flabbergasted when he saw the question, given that it is premised on an unabashedly liberal view of a politically contentious issue. When I saw it I wanted to get up and leave,  he said.  I thought  there s no way this is a real question at all. Fundamental concepts include: demand and supply, elasticity and marginalism, inflation, unemployment, business cycles, role of government,  states the course description on the school s website, adding,  These concepts are then used to explain and analyze market structures, including perfect competition and monopoly. The website also defines the course learning outcomes, which include  [analyzing] the role of government and the effect of regulation on the healthcare section as described by economics. I listen to talk radio a lot now: [Ben] Shapiro, [Steven] Crowder, [Andrew] Klavan, [Mark] Levin, and Milo [Yiannopoulos],  Fisher said.  So I knew that this type of liberal perspective being pushed on students was happening but I had no idea it was so blatant. Maybe the worst part is that so many of my classmates now believe this to be true. Several professors who spoke with Campus Reform about the matter said that while the question defines income redistribution accurately, it was unnecessary to include an endorsement of that controversial concept. This question assumes a false premise,  said Antony Davies, a professor at Duquesne University.  I do not accept the premise that redistribution is a main function of government (in general),  he added, though he did concede that  it is a main function of our government today. When asked if this is common to be taught in economics classes he claimed:  No. That s not common [to be taught]. It is common to teach that that is something governments can do. One way to read the question is that it is simply a definition: C is the definition of income redistribution. The real slant is in the start, saying that income redistribution is one of the main functions of government,  noted Mount Holyoke College economics professor Jim Hartley. Some people think that is true, but others disagree. So, if the question was written as  Income redistribution means,  the question is fine. If it started,  Some people believe one of the main functions  it would be fine,  he explained.  The assertion in the first sentence is the evidence of bias, but the question is unaffected by the bias. He also added that  The first sentence is not necessary for the test question and thus is really just serving as propaganda. Fisher told Campus Reform that he was reluctant to challenge his professor on the matter, saying,  I didn t want to risk to affecting my grade. He pushes his agenda pretty hard. The student who provided the tip wishes to remain anonymous, but added that Traxler is  pretty set with his opinion anyways,  so  I don t think [fighting him] would have made a difference.

 Trump Loses Support Of Police Union After Saying Tulsa Shooting Cop ‘Choked’ (VIDEO),"While giving a speech at a church rally in Cleveland, Donald Trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement   and it s gotten him in trouble with America s largest police union.In speaking to the rally goers in Cleveland, Trump strayed from his normal, pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about Betty Shelby, the Tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man. Clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed, Trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of African American pastors, in which he suggested that Shelby had  choked : Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can t be doing what they re doing, okay? They can t be doing what they re doing.I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you re supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man. Trump made these comments just five days after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which has 330,000 members, endorsed him. But after hearing Trump criticize the Tulsa police officer, FOP executive director Jim Pasco is livid and thinks Trump s comments were inappropriate. Pasco said that Trump must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers. Now, no one should be proud or relieved that Trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims   he s been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment, and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly. This speech was easy for Trump to say in front of black pastors   I doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience. Trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote, which may very well determine this election. Trump will say whatever he needs to win   but this time, he lost a major support group.Here s the clip that got Trump in trouble with the police union:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"September 22, 2016"

 Cliven Bundy’s Cows Are Starving To Death Because He’s A Greedy Jackass,"Because he was such a greedy prick that decided that profiting was more important than smart conservation and management of resources, Cliven Bundy s herd of cows is rumored to be facing starvation: Since the early 1990s, cattle have been left to fend for themselves in the desert after Cliven Bundy, a private rancher, lost his privilege to graze on federal public lands that belong to all Americans. This once-small herd of around 150 animals has grown to hundreds or more over the course of 20+ years and now badly exceeds the ability of the land to feed and nourish them. They range over an immense area about half the size of the state of Rhode Island. While the area is large, it only receives about 4 inches of precipitation a year and vegetation is very sparse. Once upon a time, the west was wild and cattle ranchers let their cows do whatever the hell they wanted. And what cows want to do is eat. And eat. And keep eating until there s nothing left. This is called  overgrazing,  and it s really REALLY bad for both the land and the cows. If you eat all the grass, it stops growing and the dirt blows away (Think  Dust Bowl ). And then it takes a very long time (if ever) for the grass to come back which means the cows go hungry.The ranchers, being all rugged and individualistic, originally thought that they could keep a handle on it. After all, the ranchers knew that overgrazing was bad so they would have an incentive to conserve the commons.But then the ranchers learned that even though people as a group were smart enough to conserve, there was always individual assholes that would take advantage of the situation. They would let their herd graze an area to death s door and then move on to do it somewhere else, getting rich off of hogging the resources that was supposed to be shared by everyone.Enter the Bureau of Land Management. These awful evil big government types exist to keep the aforementioned assholes in check. What bastards!Of course, this infuriates people like Bundy who only see dollar signs and to hell with everyone else:Rob Mrowka, a senior scientist with the center, said by phone that Bundy had given up his grazing rights in 1993 and simply let his cows loose to reproduce, leading to the situation where hundreds are starving now. .Normally areas of the range are rotated for grazing, with periods of rest to let it grow back, but Mrowka said the cattle  are there 24/7, 365 days.This is why Bundy was forever letting his cows go onto public land to eat OUR grass for free. Why worry about keeping your own land in good condition when you can make money by stealing the resources (grass is a staple food source for cows, making it a resource) from the public?In the process, Bundy is destroying the habitat of the endangered desert tortoise, but so what? He was making a hefty amount of money and that s all that mattered to him.This sense of entitlement and narcissism is why he s rotting in jail and will probably be there for the rest of his life. So sad.Meanwhile, now we have to deal with his starving cows before they actually start to die. Letting them suffer is unconscionable. We just have to hope that no one starts shooting at the federal agents that go to round them up before it s too late.Featured image of a random starving cow via Getty ",News,"April 15, 2016"

Their intelligence services all slept through Russia electing the U.S. President,  Nikonov said, clearly shocking the host who seemed to have no idea how to respond (especially since the wrong response could have gotten him assassinated).  What kind of intelligence service is that? As we speak, Mueller s investigation of Donald Trump is heating up as The Donald s campaign is forced to turn over documents. Many Republicans speculate that he s  going for the kill. This is all very bad news for Trump, who has managed to bamboozle his Faithful into believing that the Russia investigation is a liberal lie designed to smear him   one in which the FAKE NEWS media is complicit.Watch Rachel Maddow report on the remarks below:?BREAKING VIDEO?

 Trump Vows To Save America From ‘Curse’ Of Functional Health Care System,"In a pair of tweets on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump proved once again how out of touch he is with the American public. Just three months ago, Pew Research published a study showing that a substantial majority of Americans   some 60 percent  feel the federal government is responsible for providing healthcare coverage for all citizens. Not only that, but the formerly-controversial idea of a  single-payer  system, like the Medicare For All bill just introduced with wide Democratic support by Senator Bernie Sanders, was favored by a third of Americans.Trump, however, sees universal coverage, enjoyed by every highly-developed nation in the world except the United States, as a  curse  on the citizens of this country.Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan   a curse on the U.S. & its people  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2017 I told Republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen. But don't worry, I will veto because I love our country & its people.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2017Universal coverage was long considered a pipe dream, even as recently as during the primary campaign between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Secretary Clinton dismissed it as an  idea that will never, ever come to pass.  But buoyed by the popularity of Senator Sanders after the disastrous win by Donald Trump in November, the Democratic Party has moved decidedly left on the issue.At the time of Sanders  introduction of his bill, painted as the sane alternative to the Republican frenzy to strip all Americans of non-private health coverage, there were a number of Democratic senators signed on, including those widely considered to be front-runners for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and even the favorites among Clinton loyalists, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, all joined Senator Sanders in introducing Medicare For All. They were joined by Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Martin Heinrich, Mazie Hirono, Pat Leahy, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, Jeanne Shaheen, Tom Udall, and Sheldon Whitehouse.The irony, of course, is that even if one considers universal coverage a  curse  as Donald Trump does, the bill stands essentially no chance of passage in the first place. Trump would love to portray himself as a savior of conservative principles, but with Republicans in firm control of Congress (at least until 2018), the odds of Trump even needing to look through his plethora of gold-plated pens to find the one for vetoes are slim to none.",News,"September 14, 2017"
WISCONSIN PRIEST COMES OUT AS “GAY” During Sunday Mass…Gets Standing Ovation…Wait…What?,"In 1992, the Vatican under Pope John Paul II published the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which stated, among many other things, that  homosexual tendencies  are  objectively disordered.  One of the principal theologians who shaped the document was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would succeed John Paul II as Pope Benedict XVI. He too would take a hard-line stance against homosexuality.Two decades later, Pope Francis has signaled what many believe to be a softening on the matter.In 2013, when asked about gay priests, he famously replied,  Who am I to judge?  He has continued to call for the Catholic Church to treat LGBT people with dignity and respect, and to fight discrimination against sexual minorities.  RNSFrom the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel   The Rev. Gregory Greiten told his congregation Sunday,  I am Greg. I am a Roman Catholic priest. And, yes, I am gay! The priest in the Milwaukee Archdiocese serves as the pastor of St. Bernadette Parish. On Monday, he came out to the rest of the world with a column in the National Catholic Reporter. He received a standing ovation from his parishioners when he made his announcement before the column s publication.Greiten said he was breaking the silence of gay men in the clergy so he could reclaim his own voice.While it is established that there are gay men who serve as priests, it is rare for a priest to come out to his congregation in this way. Greiten shares an estimate in his article that there are between 8,554 and 21,571 gay Catholic priests in the United States from  The Changing Face of the Priesthood.  Church theology teaches that acting upon homosexuality is a sin.In announcing his identity as a gay man, Greiten chastised the Catholic Church for its stance on homosexuality.He wrote: By choosing to enforce silence, the institutional church pretends that gay priests and religious do not really exist. Because of this, there are no authentic role models of healthy, well-balanced, gay, celibate priests to be an example for those, young and old, who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation. This only perpetuates the toxic shaming and systemic secrecy. NYP-Greiten wrote that has decided to stand with the  few courageous priests who have taken the risk to come out of the shadows and have chosen to live in truth and authenticity. The church s silent stance on gay priests perpetuates toxic shaming and systematic secrecy, Greiten wrote. The church needs healthy role models for priests who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation, he said.Greiten met with Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki before coming out, according to an archdiocese spokeswoman. We support Father Greiten in his own personal journey and telling his story of coming to understand and live with his sexual orientation,  Listecki said in a statement Monday.  As the Church teaches, those with same-sex attraction must be treated with understanding and compassion. ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017"
 White Supremacist Chases Down Black Teen And Kills Him In Oregon,"Just remember that white supremacists support Donald Trump and the Republican Party.Because if they take power in November, racists like this guy will think they have free license to kill black people at will.Earlier this month, Russell Courtier and his girlfriend Colleen Hunt stopped at a convenience store near Portland, Oregon and started a fight with 19-year-old Larnell Bruce, a young black man.Courtier has repeatedly run afoul of the law, but keeps being let out of his cage. While in prison, he became the leader of the European Kindred, a white supremacist group. Courtier had just been paroled for attacking a woman with a knife in 2013.Anyway, Courtier slammed Bruce s head into the glass window as Hunt cheered. To defend himself, Bruce pulled a knife and Courtier retreated to his Jeep. The fight should have ended there, but Courtier wanted blood, so he violated a series of traffic laws in an effort to run Bruce over.By the time police arrived it was too late. Bruce was severely injured and Courtier and his girlfriend had fled the scene. Bruce died days later at the hospital due to the severity of his injuries.Both Courtier and Hunt were later arrested and now they have been indicted for murder and will likely face charges for committing a hate crime.Frankly, this is one of those cases where law enforcement and our judicial system failed the public simply because Courtier is white. He has four felony convictions and seven misdemeanors on his record, yet he was still unleashed upon society. On the flip side, African-Americans are being shot by police in the streets for doing nothing criminal whatsoever. If Courtier were black, he d either be dead before he ever saw the inside of a courtroom or he would be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole. He certainly would not have received as many chances for freedom as he has squandered.But Courtier is white, and now the Oregon judiciary has blood on their hands.What may be even scarier is the fact that white supremacists like Courtier are big fans of Donald Trump because they believe he ll make America white again and bring their racist cause into the mainstream.These are people who cheer for the killing of black people and are just waiting for the day when they can do so with impunity.If you want a glimpse of what Donald Trump s America would look like, the murder of Larnell Bruce by a white supremacist in the middle of an open street should tell you everything you need to know.Featured image via Multnomah County Sheriff s Office",News,"September 1, 2016"
 Ann Coulter Makes SICK Comparison Between Hillary And Hitler In Asking Where Bernie’s Fans Went,"Far-right conservative and resident anti-Semitic bigot, Ann Coulter, has harsh words for Hillary Clinton. Of course, Coulter hasn t liked anything any Democrat has ever done in the whole entire history of everything, and has never been afraid to say so. This, however, is way over the line of gross, sick and disgusting, even for someone like Coulter.She compared Hillary to Hitler. Hitler comparisons are nothing new and fly all over the place from both the left and the right. Coulter, however, managed to combine her anti-Semitism with her ugly Hitler comparison to ask a question about where Bernie Sanders  supporters were on Night 2 of the DNC:Bernie Sanders is Jewish. By asking if Hillary had his followers gassed, she s saying that Hillary is at least as horrific as Hitler, if not more so since she s not our president yet. It s also a not-so subtle dig at both Bernie and his supporters.There are just no words to describe how twisted that is. It s not just an offensive slam against a presidential candidate. It s an offensive slam to everyone who survived the Holocaust, who lost loved ones in the Holocaust, who are descended from Holocaust survivors, and who witnessed the Holocaust.It s worse than offensive, actually. It s abhorrent. It s repugnant. It s repulsive.It s also classic Ann Coulter, which tells us something about her character.Coulter is a Trumpette, meaning she s all but in love with Donald Trump and everything he stands for, including his dangerous hate. She ll say anything hateful to a) take down his opponents, and b) make sure he notices her.Coulter s anti-Semitism runs very deep in her black and shriveled heart. She links to, and regularly cites, an alt-right website known as VDARE, which is a white supremacist site with strong anti-Semitic undertones. She also got upset with all the talk about Israel during one of the GOP debates, and she said that Jews are just Christians in need of perfection back in 2007: That is what Christians consider themselves: perfected Jews. If ever there was someone who needs to get lost and stay lost, it s Coulter. Asking if Hillary had Bernie s supporters gassed, as though she threw them into gas chambers because they were a threat to her, goes way beyond the boundaries of pretty much everything.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 27, 2016"
WOW! MAJOR CREDIT CARD COMPANY Still Sponsoring Central Park Production Depicting Assassination Of President Trump After Other Sponsors Flee [VIDEO],"   Delta Air Lines and Bank of America became the first companies to announce they are pulling their sponsorships of a Manhattan-based theater company s portrayal of Julius Caesar as a Donald Trump look-alike in a business suit who gets stabbed to death on stage.Delta and Bank of America both announced their intentions on Sunday. No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summer s Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines  values,  the company s statement said.  Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. Bank of America added it was withdrawing funding for the production. The Public Theater chose to present Julius Caesar in such a way that was intended to provoke and offend,  the bank said in a tweet.  Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it.   Fox News American Express also took to Twitter and announced their sponsorship doesn t support the play.A Statement from American Express: pic.twitter.com/Ig0Ju3B2dP  American Express (@AmericanExpress) June 12, 2017 We would like to clarify that our sponsorship of the Public Theater does not fund the production of Shakespeare in the Park nor do we condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play,  the financial corporation tweeted.Customers of American Express responded on Twitter:I'm am considering not accepting AE cards at my business and reminding customers why just to clarify.  rex prescott (@rex1956) June 12, 2017Sadly, we expect the New York Times to support a production of President Trump being assassinated, but Amex customers like myself who currently use an American Express card can just as easily switch to VISA or MasterCard.

 Virginia Republican Says Conservatives Own Christianity In Attack On Obama For Citing Bible (AUDIO),"A House Tea Party Republican declared that conservatives own Christianity during an attack against President Obama.In his moral defense of granting asylum to thousands of Syrian refugees, President Obama cited the Bible in November to counter anti-refugee conservatives. Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger  - we were strangers once, too,  Obama said. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. Indeed, the Bible commands Christians to love foreigners and treat them with respect and compassion. Deuteronomy 10:19 states:And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.And Leviticus 19:34 states:The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.The verse President Obama referenced is Exodus 23:9, which states,You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.As we all know, Republicans are constantly claiming that America is a Christian nation and that we must adhere to Christian values. So if that is the case, you would think Republicans would jump to support President Obama and his effort to help refugees who are fleeing war and death in their homeland.But they aren t. In fact, they not only oppose President Obama, they are attacking him for using the Bible against them.During an interview with American Family Radio host Sandy Rios on Monday, Virginia Rep. David Brat argued that President Obama can t use the Bible to hit back at conservatives because he says the right-wing owns Christianity, and must indoctrinate people to make sure they are brainwashed to believe that conservatives have a monopoly on Christian values. Our side, the conservative side, needs to reeducate its people that we own the entire tradition. If you lose the moral argument, you lose the policy argument every time, so we need to reclaim the moral argument, where we re so strong. He also claimed that President Obama is using the Bible to build federal power. He s using the Christian tradition and trying to bring about compassion by bonking Republicans over the head with the Bible. It s almost a comedy routine on what compassion and love is. He s mocking his enemies in order to compel a larger federal state using the tradition of love. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.So David Brat believes that Republicans alone own Christianity and have the only right to use the Bible to push their political agenda. Of course, he is assuming that only Republicans are Christians, which is complete bullshit.Brat and his fellow conservatives are just pissed that President Obama used the Bible to reveal them as complete hypocrites. If Republicans really gave a damn about what the Bible said, they d be pushing for universal healthcare, a stronger food stamp program and would welcome refugees with open arms. But they don t, thereby proving that they are nothing more than opportunistic cherry-pickers who abuse religion for their own gain.Featured Image: Wikimedia ",News,"January 13, 2016"
WORRIED ABOUT TRUMP LOSING HIS OWN MONEY? $6 BILLION LOST Under Hillary Clinton As Secretary Of State,"The State Department misplaced and lost some $6 billion due to the improper filing of contracts during the past six years, mainly during the tenure of former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, according to a newly released Inspector General report. The $6 billion in unaccounted funds poses a  significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department s contract actions,  according to the report. The alert, originally sent on March 20 and just released this week, warns that the missing contracting funds  could expose the department to substantial financial losses.  The report centered on State Department contracts worth  more than $6 billion in which contract files were incomplete or could not be located at all,  according to the alert.  The failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department s contract actions,  the alert states.Read more: WT",Government News,"Oct 4, 2016"

The U.S is the land of opportunity and dreams for many people all over the world. The heightened profile for Khairullah, a former teacher in the Paterson public schools who worked at Office Depot, represents growing political power for Muslims in New Jersey politics.Seven weeks ago, Passaic County elected its first Muslim Freeholder when Assad Akhter, a deputy chief of staff to U.S. Rep.

 Republicans Are About To Bailout A Foreign Company That Screwed Over 500K American Consumers,"Do you remember the time that Republicans thought automotive companies should be allowed to go bankrupt? They seem to have forgotten all about that.House Republicans are set to give a big wet kiss to Volkswagen in the form of a bailout that will prevent them from being sued by over 500,00 American consumers, against whom they admitted committing fraud.Volkswagen has been caught up in a huge scandal after it admitted to cheating on air pollution standards. The context behind the scandal and ensuing lawsuits lies with  defeat devices  that VW had installed in approximately 580,000 of their diesel vehicles, in order to fool emissions testing in the U.S.Remember, these are the same Republicans that worked to block a VW plant from opening in Chattanooga, Tennessee because the plant was going to be unionized. This proves they don t really care about Volkswagen. They just really love hurting American citizens.The suit, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the EPA could net Volkswagen up to $18 billion in fines. However, that s not all of their problems. The Justice Department also indicated that it could roll individual lawsuits into their litigation as well. The individual lawsuits come from owners that might win up to $6,000 each in compensation for paying more than a gas-powered model costs plus decline in resale value. Add on a potential 3 billion more from consolidated individual cases Whoa! That s a lot of money!What will Volkswagen do? Why, run to Republicans of course.Yes, these are the same Republicans that wanted GM to just go bankrupt when a bailout for them would save jobs. It s clearly a different story when government action helps regular people. For rich, faceless corporations no bailout is too large or too insane   and this bailout is truly insane.The bill, which doesn t actually offer monetary compensation to cover VW s lawsuit costs, will instead make it virtually impossible for a class action suit to be brought against the corporation.From The Fiscal Times:The simplicity of the VW Bailout Bill belies the chaos it would create. Proponents like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the bill s leading lobbyist, say they merely want to get rid of  non-injury  class-action cases, based on potential damages from defective consumer products or corporate actions that have yet to result in harm. Lawyers for class-action litigants argue that defective products deserve compensation even if the consumer hasn t yet been injured.But the bill goes much further, stating that courts may not certify class-action suits unless the plaintiff  affirmatively demonstrates that each proposed class member suffered the same type and scope of injury as the named class representative or representatives. This is devastating because it sets up all class-actions to fail,  says attorney Lori Andrus, who represents several Volkswagen plaintiffs. If every class member must have the same type and scope of injury, it forces extensive proofs for class certification   essentially a full-blown trial up front, where plaintiffs will have to prove that their injuries match with their fellow representatives.Source: The Fiscal TimesTo put it simply, this isn t only for Volkswagen. This is a good straw-man case that Republicans can use to do something they have wanted to do for decades:  shut the door to justice on American consumers that get screwed over by corporations. It would allow for rampant abuse of the system, resulting in sub-standard products being sold, with little to no recourse available to consumers ever. Additionally, it would overturn decades of judicial precedent where corporations were held accountable for fraud while circumventing federal rules that lay out class action standards.As an extra insult, Republicans are pairing the bill with the FACT Act, which would force public reporting of personal information of asbestos victims, in an effort to sabotage their compensation for poisoning. It s incredibly inappropriate for Congress to send the message that it s OK to hurt people by the millions,  said Rebecca Kaplan   a Volkswagen owner.  The more people you hurt, the more this law will protect you. Featured image via screen capture from YouTube",News,"January 6, 2016"
 New Analysis Shows Black Neighborhoods Excluded From Amazon Same Day Delivery,"A Bloomberg analysis of Amazon s same-day delivery service locations shows that Black neighborhoods are routinely excluded from access to the service.Although all customers pay the same $99 fee for the Amazon Prime membership, which includes same-day delivery service in covered areas, Black customers are significantly less likely to have access to that service.According to the Bloomberg study, Black customers who live in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington DC are 50 percent less likely to have access to same-day delivery.Bloomberg further reports:In New York City, same-day delivery is available throughout Manhattan, Staten Island, and Brooklyn, but not in the Bronx and some majority-black neighborhoods in Queens. In some cities, Amazon same-day delivery extends many miles into the surrounding suburbs but isn t available in some ZIP codes within the city limits.Out of all the places where Amazon same-day delivery services are available to Amazon Prime members, the analysis shows the greatest disparity in the city of Boston.According to the Bloomberg analysis: Three ZIP codes encompassing the primarily black neighborhood of Roxbury are excluded from same-day service, while the neighborhoods that surround it on all sides are eligible. In many cases this means that Black customers have no access to same-day delivery, while white customers, living just a few blocks away, do have access.Here s what the delivery zones look like in some of the most populated urban areas.Image credit: Screen capture Bloomberg.comAccording to Amazon vice president for global communications, Craig Berman, the company did not intentionally create a service area which excludes Black neighborhood.Berman says that service areas were determined by data and algorithms.As Tech Insider reports here, Amazon PR Director Scott Stanzel described the criteria the company used to generate the algorithm.According to Stanzel, that included  distance to the nearest fulfillment center, local demand in an area, numbers of Prime members in an area, as well as the ability of our various carrier partners to deliver up to 9:00 pm every single day, even Sunday. So how does a computer program which doesn t include race as a factor, generate a service area that excludes Black neighborhoods?Tech Insider sums it up best, by explaining:Racism, as researchers have documented in countless studies and reports, is the systemic marginalization of minority communities. It s the aggregate of small and large effects that make it harder for people to find housing, accumulate wealth, avoid the criminal justice system, and succeed in school if they aren t white. Data and algorithms selected in deliberate ignorance of racism can pick up and reinforce that systemic problem.So basically the algorithm reflects the racism that is already present in a service area. As described by Tech Insider, it  reflects ongoing economic disparities and segregation between white and black communities created by decades of redlining. That appears to be exactly what happened in the case of Amazon s same-day delivery service area coverage.Amazon says the company has plans to  fill in the gaps  in service coverage  over time. That doesn t seem like a good enough answer when the data shows that many Black customers are being denied equal service under the company s current model.Mistakes can happen, yes, but now that the problems have clearly been exposed, Amazon should take immediate steps to correct them.It s one thing to unknowingly generate an algorithm that excludes Black neighborhoods. It s another thing altogether to look the other way once you re aware of the issue. Image credit: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2016"

LORETTA LYNCH’S “Behavior” in 2016 Election To Be Investigated By Judiciary Committee [Video],"It s about time the Senate Judiciary Committee opened a probe into former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s efforts to shape the FBI s investigation into the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton! The committee s chairman announced the bipartisan probe on Friday:The committee sent a letter to Lynch asking her to tell in detail everything about her involvement in the FBI s investigation. They want to know whether she ever assured Clinton confidantes that the probe wouldn t  push too deeply into the matter.  This could get really good if they can get Lynch to squeal.THIS IS A BIPARTISAN EFFORT:SENATOR FEINSTEIN CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION IN EARLY JUNE: How shocking is it that liberal Senator Diane Feinstein is calling for a closer look at the possible collusion between Lynch and Comey:Dianne Feinstein calls on Congress to investigate whether Loretta Lynch pressured Comey to cover for Hillary Clinton s campaign.#ComeyGate pic.twitter.com/AMwQoQsMe0  Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) June 11, 2017 Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Sunday that Congress should investigate whether former Attorney General Loretta Lynch pressured former FBI Director James Comey to cover for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign. I think we need to know more about that,  Feinstein told host Brianna Keilar on CNN s  State of the Union. And there s only way to know about it, and that s to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that,  Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said.Comey testified last Thursday that he felt  queasy  after Lynch asked him to characterize his probe into Clinton s emails as a  matter,  rather than an investigation. He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that such a request would match the wording of Clinton s campaign.Feinstein, who is a member of the Senate Intelligence panel, said she would ve also felt queasy. I would have a queasy feeling, too, though, to be candid with you,  the longtime Senate Democrat said.She added that an investigation separate from the ongoing probe into Russian interference in the election is needed.

He also hinted at other behavior  which I cannot talk about yet . He was concerned about Lynch s ability to do her job without impartiality. Mr. Comey said that was one reason why he took it upon himself to buck Justice Department tradition and reveal his findings about Mrs. Clinton last year.If anyone had really looked into Lynch s background, they would know she s a big political hack.

EPA CHIEF: ‘CLIMATE DENIERS’ AREN’T NORMAL PEOPLE,"What s with the cultish attitude coming from our EPA chief? This is so creepy and Orwellian but the big push on climate change has even sucked in the Pope. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told an audience Tuesday gathered at a White House conference  normal people,  not  climate deniers  will win the debate on global warming.McCarthy s remarks came as she was talking about the reasons why the EPA put out a report on the negative health impacts global warming will have on public health. She said the agency puts out such reports to educate the public, not answer critiques from global warming skeptics. I am doing that not to push back on climate deniers,  McCarthy told doctors, health professionals and others gathered at a White House summit.  You can have fun doing that if you want, but I ve batted my head against the wall too many times and if the science already hasn t changed their mind it never will. McCarthy then remarked how  normal people,  and not skeptics would eventually win the global warming debate. Implicit in her remarks is the contention that skeptics are somehow not  normal people. But in any democracy, it s not them that carries the day,  McCarthy said.  It is normal human beings that haven t put their stake into politics above science. It s normal human beings that want us to do the right thing, and we will if you help us. Read more: The Daily Caller",Government News,"Jun 24, 2015"
 Seizure Victim 2nd Amendmented A Fireman Who Responded To Wife’s 911 Call To Help Him,"Greg Pruitt s wife was awoken at approximately 5 a.m. when she noticed her husband was having a seizure. Quickly, she called 911. As help was on its way, Greg s seizure started to subside a bit, and he was coming out of it when help arrived.Twenty-nine-year-old Jason Adams, a volunteer fireman, was the first responder on the scene. When Adams was standing in the doorway of the room where Pruitt was, attempting to evaluate the situation, Pruitt promptly shot and killed Adams, thinking he was an intruder.Adams was a nearby neighbor who lived approximately a half-mile from the residence. A witness who entered the home after the shooting gave the same account of what happened. Adams was rushed to a local medical center in North Little Rock but was pronounced dead.Not very surprisingly, authorities do not know if there will be any charges filed in this  accidental  shooting.Please, can we admit yet that we have a problem with guns in America? This is a perfect example of why we do. I know when people are in an emergency situation, possibly panicking, they don t think about the gun that is in arm s reach of a seizure victim, or about what will happen because of it when a stranger suddenly enters their home. But, is that really an acceptable way to write off this sort of thing?The idea of  responsible gun ownership  is exactly what s in question here. Why are we living in such paranoia, in the  home of the brave,  to where we are shooting at every shadow we see? It s incredibly wrong for a first responder to have to second-guess rendering aid because they re afraid they will get shot just by showing up. The concept of  always shoot first because it s just an accident if you do,  that has been cultivated by the NRA and Republicans in America needs to come to an end.Watch news coverage of the incident below:featured image via twitter",News,"January 22, 2016"
DID TRUMP OFFEND HISPANIC AMERICANS WITH HIS REMARKS? The Latest Poll Numbers With Hispanics May Surprise You,"The GOP leadership may want to rethink their position on amnesty for illegals. American citizens (yes, including Hispanic Americans) are more interested in a President who abides by the rule of law than one who is beholden to corporations for donations Build a wall and enforce our border laws it s really pretty simple.Rick Perry blasted Donald Trump for his comments on immigration. It s been widely suggested that those comments would turn off Latino voters and Trump was ridiculed for saying that he could win Latino voters.But the latest, very favorable YouGov poll for Trump, shows Trump doing better with Hispanic respondents than Rick Perry. Trump scores a 19%  very favorable  and a 9% very favorable. He also has a 51% very unfavorable. Rick Perry has a 7% very favorable and a 16% favorable. Of course around a third of Hispanics just don t know who Rick Perry is so it s possible that he could improve his numbers.There are similar numbers for most Republican candidates.Jeb Bush has a 12% very favorable and a 20% favorable. Those are good numbers, but Jeb Bush lags Trump among the very favorables and isn t that far head in the total favorables. Considering that Jeb Bush s people are positioning him as a guy who can talk to Latino voters and has been front and center attacking Trump, those are not impressive numbers.Ben Carson has some of the best numbers among Latinos with a 17% very favorable and a 13% somewhat favorable. His numbers among black voters are actually poor, but he s popular with Latinos.Ted Cruz is at 17% very favorable and 24% favorable. His unfavorables are at a combined 29% with 30% who don t know who he is. These are pretty good numbers.Some of the best numbers come from Mike Huckabee with 19% very favorable and 17% very favorable, but these numbers are skewed because 45% don t know who he is. But his negatives are low. The same goes for Bobby Jindal with 13% and 16% favorables among Hispanics and likewise many don t know who he is.Marco Rubio has a 20% very favorable and 16% somewhat favorable with an unfavorable combined of over 40% with only 21% not knowing who he is.That s the important point about Trump s unfavorability numbers. While they look terrible, it s quite likely that most or all of the Republican candidates will end up with high unfavorables after they become better known and have had enough media attacks leveled against them.When only 11% don t know who Marco Rubio is, his unfavorable numbers will probably still be better than those of Trump, but assuming he won and was nominated, I m not sure how much better they would be by the end of the election.These numbers don t mean that Trump will win the Latino vote. Obviously not. But they do mean that1. The Latino vote is not monolithic. There is concern there about illegal immigration and the resulting gang violence. And economic issues trump immigration. Perry arguably has a better record on that than Trump, but few non-Texans might know that. After all the attacks on Trump, he has some of the highest positive numbers among Republicans. He s beating or neck and neck with immigration panderers.2. Being critical on illegal immigration is not necessarily a political death sentence despite the corporate and media hysteria stirred up to make it look that way.One more piece of bad news, despite Marco Rubio s hard sell as the youth candidate, he s doing no better or worse among younger respondents than Trump. Ted Cruz is doing somewhat better than Rubio.Via: Front Page Magazine",Government News,"Jul 10, 2015"
CLASSIC TRUMP! President Trump Announces Where He’ll Be On Eve Of White House Correspondents Dinner…CHECK MATE!,"On the eve of the upcoming 2017 White House Correspondents Dinner, President Trump will be miles away from DC and from the lion s den of so-called reporters who would love nothing more than to destroy him at the event. President Trump has chosen instead to spend the evening connecting with the voters who shocked the nation when they overwhelmingly turned out for him on election day in the formerly blue state of Pennsylvania.Trump made the announcement on Twitter:  Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it! Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017Only 6 years ago, hundreds of leftist media hacks were doubled over in laughter while Barack Obama openly mocked Donald Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents dinner.Little did the media at that White House Correspondents Dinner know, that the man they were so thrilled to see being mocked by our former Community Organizer in Chief would be our next President. They never dreamed that the man they were mocking while he sat defenseless that night would literally turn the once  trusted  media on its head. For the first time ever, Trump forced the media to play defense instead of assuming the offensive posture they d been used to taking against Republicans and conservatives for decades. Trump shamed them for using their publications and networks to promote the Democrat Party and their radical agenda, and America cheered.McKay Coppins of Buzzfeed wrote about the mistake Obama made that night when he brought the  birther  nonsense to a head which (according to her) overrode Obama s better judgment and led him to tear into Trump to his face:On the night of the dinner, Trump took his seat at the center of the ballroom, perfectly situated so that all 2,500 lawmakers, movie stars, journalists, and politicos in attendance could see him .But as soon as the plates were cleared and the program began, it became agonizingly clear that Trump was not royalty in this room: He was the court jester.The president used his speech to pummel Trump with one punchline after another When host Seth Meyers took the mic, he piled on with his own rat-a-tat of jokes, many of which seemed designed deliberately to inflame Trump s outer-borough insecurities:  His whole life is models and gold leaf and marble columns, but he still sounds like a know-it-all down at the OTB.  The longer the night went on, the more conspicuous Trump s glower became. He didn t offer a self-deprecating chuckle, or wave warmly at the cameras, or smile with the practiced good humor of the aristocrats and A-listers who know they must never allow themselves to appear threatened by a joke at their expense. Instead, Trump just sat there, stone-faced, stunned, simmering   Carrie at the prom covered in pig s blood. Watch:Obama, of course, had his reasons for wanting petty vengeance over the birth certificate controversy, which he not-unreasonably regarded as racist. But he s also the prime example of a guy who has always been the coolest kid in the room ( I m LeBron, baby ), and the spectacle of him using the platform of an event originally designed for l se-majest  to lock arms with a TV comic and gang-tackle Trump s ego to his face to the laughter of a crowd that Obama fit into and Trump didn t is one of the more graceless things he s done. His speechwriters, John Favreau and Jon Lovett, express some remorse now for having let the  circus-like atmosphere  goad them, and Obama, into it. One doubts that the president has any second thoughts; he rarely does.But what comes off clearly is that the WHCD has become just another vehicle for amplifying, rather than leavening, the presidential megaphone and the bitterness of our present politics, while widening the gulf between the DC  cool kids  and the rest of the country. It s a tradition that has outlived its usefulness, and should die.  National ReviewObama used his last White House Correspondents dinner to joke about it possibly being  perhaps the last White House Correspondents Dinner . It may have been the only thing he said that night that may actually turn out to be true.",left-news,"Apr 22, 2017"

HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP Can Remove Congress From Their ObamaCare Exemption [Video],"President Trump tweeted that he was considering removing bailouts and forcing Congress to pay for their health insurance at the same rates as the rest of the country. BELOW, DR. MICHAEL SIEGEL AND MICHAEL NEEDHAM (BELOW) DISCUSS HOW TRUMP CAN TAKE THE OBAMACARE EXEMPTION FROM CONGRESS:Michael Needham appeared on Fox Weekend News to discuss the possibility of President Trump removing tax-payer funded subsidies for individual members of Congress, and their staff, that allows them to avoid feeling the cost of ObamaCare.He states that this tweet could put the right pressure on Congress to come to a decision by making them  feel the full impact of the premium increases that the American people are feeling.  The American people are tired of Washington playing by different rules. In order to escape the skyrocketing premiums and other disadvantages of Obamacare, Congress defined itself as a  small business  which would entail an organization that employs fifty people or less. This then put them into the DC Small Business Exchange, allowing them to receive up to $12,000 in subsidies. He believes that it s the Senate that needs to step up to the plate since the House and POTUS have already stated their support.Read more: The Conservative Tree House",Government News,"Jul 30, 2017"
HOUSE TAKES ACTION TO BLOCK OBAMA From Releasing Every Last Guantanamo Terrorist Before Leaving White House,"House Republicans are gathering closely around a bill that would essentially block President Barack Obama from releasing any more detainees from Guantanamo Bay until Congress can create a new defense policy bill.Even though the House passed the bill on a 244 to 174 vote,  some leading Republican House members acknowledge that it stands almost no chance of being approved by the Senate.Despite that possibility the House s vote represents a final stand in the eight-year struggle between Republicans and President Barack Obama, who have fought rigorously over the future of the detention facility housing suspected terrorists that Obama has sworn to shut down. The White House has also threatened to veto this attempt as well.In August, the president approved the largest single transfer of detainees, 15 total were sent to the United Arab Emirates, leaving the population at 61. Two of those released from Guantanamo Bay now join others that have reengaged in terrorist activity.The bill s sponsor, Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind, states  We wouldn t be seeing 30 percent recidivism if we had true partners in this cause and in these countries.  He continues by saying that  Obama s detainee transfer policy is more about the president running out of time to fulfill his campaign promise than about the national security interest of the United States, and that puts Americans at risk.

 The Obamas Gave A Heartbreaking Tribute To Muhammad Ali (VIDEO),"The last couple of years have been rampant with what seems like premature deaths. Would we have ever been able to prepare ourselves for the deaths of Robin Williams, David Bowie, Prince and so many, many more people? Unfortunately, we have another name to add to what seems like a particularly grim year: Muhammad Ali   and the Obamas, in a statement to America,  mourned the loss as deeply as any of us.To the Obamas, Ali   who was resoundingly loved and admired, and was actually (unlike President Obama) a black Muslim   was  The Greatest. Period. Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we re also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time, Muhammad Ali was The Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he d tell you. He d tell you he was the double greatest; that he d  handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail,  Obama wrote.  But what made The Champ the greatest   what truly separated him from everyone else   is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing. The President also tweeted, showing himself working with a picture of the Champ behind him.He shook up the world, and the world s better for it. Rest in peace, Champ. pic.twitter.com/z1yM3sSLH3  President Obama (@POTUS) June 4, 2016Obama also noted that he has a pair of Ali s boxing gloves in his private study.Obama continued,  I am America,  he once declared.  I am the part you won t recognize. But get used to me   black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.  That s the Ali I came to know as I came of age   not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn t. His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today. Muhammad Ali shook up the world,  Obama concluded in his tribute to Ali.  And the world is better for it. We are all better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace. Source: Rolling StoneHere s a video:While Obama was born during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, he came of age watching Ali. To Obama, Martin Luther King and even Malcolm X were parts of history books, but Ali was brash, confident, smart, socially aware and a force to be reckoned with in the 60s and 70s. While so many Civil Rights leaders were working behind the scenes, or perhaps in front, but more quietly, Ali told the world that he could do anything, no matter his skin color. Perhaps there would have never been a President Barack Obama if it weren t for the example put forth by Muhammad Ali.Featured image via Kent Gavin at Getty Images.",News,"June 5, 2016"
" Trump Goes Mental On Threats To North Korea, This Is His Most Dangerous One Yet (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has now taken his threats to North Korea off Twitter and is making them to the public. Quite frankly, the situation is getting more terrifying as the days go on.After tweeting this morning that U.S. military solutions were  locked and loaded,  Trump made some very disturbing comments when speaking to reporters this afternoon at his New Jersey golf course, where he is enjoying a 17-day vacation.When a reporter asked Trump about his ominous tweet, Trump stated that he meant exactly what he said and that his words are very, very easy to understand.  Trump also said that the Trump administration would be  very, very successful  in acting swiftly on North Korea, right before directly attacking North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Trump said: And if he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat, which, by the way, he has been uttering for years, and his family has been uttering for years, or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that s an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast. This all began when Trump threatened North Korea with  fire and fury  on Tuesday, and now we re here. Trump is leading America down a dangerous road, and he barely understands the consequences that will follow. He carelessly speaks through his insecurities and fragile ego and shows no concern for how irresponsible his comments actually are. Trump is more concerned with looking like a tough leader (and like a dictator) than he is with improving the country and keeping peaceful working relations with the rest of the world. If this is the kind of disaster we are looking at just a few months into Trump s presidency, the world will be in shambles if he lasts four years.You can watch this disturbing Trump footage below:Featured image via Drew Angerer /Getty Images",News,"August 11, 2017"

"AFTER 5 YEARS Of Being Bullied By Barack Obama, President Trump Signs Religious Liberty Exec Order To Protect “Little Sisters Of The Poor”"," Freedom is not a gift from government. It is a gift from God.    President Donald J. Trump, May 4, 2017The Little Sisters correctly insist that sterilizations, abortifacient chemical birth control and artificial contraception are all immoral. They are not only against the teaching of the scripture and Christian tradition but, as Catholics, the Sisters also maintain that they violate the Natural Moral Law.The Obama administration has asked the Court to compel these Little Sisters of the Poor to do indirectly what they refuse to do directly. They asked the Court to force Catholic nuns to sin, to act against conscience, to pursue an immoral course of action. The nuns were placed in a situation reminiscent of other times in the history of the Church when unjust rulers sought to compel the Church to bend the knee to Caesar.Here are what the Little Sisters Of The Poor are all about. One look at these lovely women who have devoted their lives to God and to helping others in need, and you will see why President Trump made helping them live their faith without fear of persecution a priority:President Donald Trump signed a religious liberty executive order today that would protect Christian organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor from being forced to pay for abortions.Today is the National Day of Prayer and the White House is celebrating the occasion with Christian leaders by scheduling the order signing today. The order is a promise to respect religious rights and could pave the way for the Trump administration dropping the lawsuit the Obama administration was fighting against the Little Sisters and dozens of Christian entities not wanting to pay for abortions or abortion-causing drugs.The order indicates the Trump administration will  provide regulatory relief for religious objectors to Obamacare s burdensome preventive services mandate, a position supported by the Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins was at the White House for the signing ceremony of an executive order protecting religious liberty. He told LifeNews.com that the new order ensures the freedom of all Americans to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs. The executive order makes clear that the administration will pursue policies that  protect and vigorously promote religious liberty. The President s executive order is a clear reflection of his campaign promise to protect the religious freedoms of Americans. President Trump is taking a significant first step to defending religious liberty. In working with the Trump administration, it is clear that they both recognize and understand the dangers of the anti-faith policies of the previous administration and are therefore committed to undoing those policies and restoring true religious freedom,  he said.  The freedom to live out faith in all areas of society without government punishment or intimidation is what has made America great.   Life NewsWatch here: ",left-news,"May 5, 2017"

In fact, for a guy who owes a fuckton of money, we re pretty sure he didn t  forget  about it either.On Friday, Jared and a senior White House adviser released a revised version of his personal financial disclosure which now shows that his initial filing omitted dozens of assets, including commercial real estate, bonds issued by the New York water and sewer authority, a personal art collection and a New Jersey liquor license, the Wall Street Journal reports.Hey, we re not talking about one or two assets that Jared omitted from his earlier form; we re talking about 77 of them.Ivanka Trump s form hasn t yet been certified by the ethics office, as required by law. Details schmetails! Jared and Ivanka have followed each of the required steps in their transition from private citizens to federal officials,  Jamie Gorelick, a lawyer for the couple, said in a statement.Drain the Swamp, Donald Trump said, then he filled it up with his swampy family members:The new disclosure shows Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump collectively hold between $206 million and $760 million in assets. Mr. Kushner s initial disclosure put the value of their assets between $240 million and $740 million. The changes in values may reflect divestments since the last filing and the broad range of valuation for assets.Well now! That s not a lot of money. Oh wait, Don Fox, who served as the ethics office s general counsel from 2008 to 2013 and as acting director from 2011 until 2013, says otherwise.Fox said the number of omissions on Jared Kushner s initial form was unusually high.  That strikes me as a lot,  he said.You don t say.The Wall Street Journal reports:In his initial disclosure, Mr. Kushner didn t identify business relationships with Goldman Sachs Group and billionaires George Soros and Peter Thiel through a real-estate tech startup called Cadre that Mr. Kushner co-founded and currently partly owns, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. An investment in Cadre valued at between $5 million and $25 million was included on the new disclosure, which showed Mr. Kushner  intended to resign  from his position with Cadre in January but didn t do so until May.According to Kushner s lawyer, it was simply  an administrative error.  We re sure his art collection valued at between $5 million and $25 million was merely an oversight, too. But, according to the lawyer, the art collection was just for  personal enjoyment,  and had nothing to do with investment purposes.And then there s the Kushner s $1 billion in loans that he failed to disclose previously. Those loans were from more than 20 lenders.It gets worse:Mr. Kushner has also filed revisions to a form required to obtain a security clearance that, in its initial form, didn t list contacts between him and foreign government officials. He subsequently submitted information about  over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries,  Ms. Gorelick has said in a statement. Those contacts weren t made public.The Trump Crime Family s mounting conflicts of interest are being paraded out after more and more information is revealed. The Trumps seem to suffer from selective memory issues. As for Jared, it s always the quiet ones that you should watch. We re sure that Mr. Mueller is watching this spectacle, too.Photo by Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",News,"July 21, 2017"
 Watch This CNN Host Need To Stop Himself From Laughing At Trump After Ridiculous Lie (VIDEO),"A lot of credit needs to be given to those who work in the media and have to put up with these presidential candidates daily. Especially those coming from the clown car on the right   in particular, Donald Trump. The real estate mogul will literally say practically anything that suits him in the moment. It doesn t matter if he changes his tune five minutes later, his opinions sway with whatever is most opportunistic for him at any given time.Take, for instance, his tax returns that Mitt Romney and several others are calling for. Now, during the latest GOP debate he said he can t show his returns because they are currently being audited, and he cited that s what happens with most large businesses and business owners, so for that reason he can t show his returns yet until the audit is over. Then after the debate, during an interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo, Trump claimed he was likely being audited and unfairly treated by the IRS because he s a Christian. So, in the matter of about an hour, he tried pandering to business owners and then later to Christians. After all, several supposed Christians feel as though they are being persecuted for not being allowed to legally discriminate any longer, and Trump knowing this selling line is already out there, uses it for his own purposes as well. He s not dumb   but he clearly thinks those who like him are. After all,  he loves the poorly educated. Cuomo, however, had to do his best to hold it together while Trump was trying to claim he was being audited based on his Christianity. Trump said: I m always audited by the IRS, which I think is very unfair. I don t know whether it s maybe because of religion or because of something else, maybe because I m doing this [running for office]. When Cuomo asked Trump to further explain what he meant by  religion,  Trump said: Well, maybe because of the fact that I m a strong Christian and I feel strongly about it, so maybe there s a bias. This is when you can clearly see Cuomo raise his eyebrows and hold his face together as best he can not to just laugh in Trump s face. Trump continued: You have many religious groups that are complaining about that. They ve been complaining about it for a long time. So wait, now Trump is a  religious group ?? Umm Trump is clearly trying to dodge the need to release his returns, and he s trying as many lines as possible to see what sticks so he won t have to release them. Kudos for the effort, but not all of us are as dumb as Trump supporters and can spot this clear poppycock from a mile away.This is the video of his entire post-debate interview with CNN, but his audit malarkey begins at the 4:27 mark: Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 26, 2016"
“White Student Union” Forms Facebook Page To Organize Against #BlackLivesMatter Terrorists On Campus…University Asks Facebook To Remove “Offensive” Page,"This Barack Obama-Eric Holder inspired anti-American, anti-White movement is not just about marginalizing White people and demanding they assume a position of shame for a crime they never committed, it s about taking America down a few notches. It s about anti-law enforcement, anti-military, anti-corporation (that won t stop these terrorists from applying for jobs at one of these corporations or businesses run by the capitalist pigs they despise) anti-freedom of speech it s about anarchy. It s about time someone turned the tables on them and called these entitled brats out for behaving like domestic terrorists. Watch the most recent Black Lives Matter protest at the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne here, on The Office of Inclusion & Intercultural Relations Twitter page :Happening now: Black Student Solidarity Rally on the Main Quad #blackstudentrallyuiuc pic.twitter.com/uG1wCV0Bio  OIIR at Illinois (@OIIR_Illinois) November 18, 2015At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, somebody (still anonymous at this point, apparently) put up a Facebook page announcing the proposed formation of a White Student Union which purports to specifically counter the activities of Black Lives Matter demonstrations on campus. Needless to say, this is going to set some people s hair on fire. (Washington Post)A Facebook page ostensibly created for an audience at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign called  Illini White Students Union  has drawn fire after it characterized the national Black Lives Matter movement as  terrorism. Created Wednesday after a protest sympathetic to Black Lives Matter, the page declared itself  for white students of University of Illinois to be able to form a community and discuss our own issues as well as be able to organize against the terrorism we have been facing from Black Lives Matter activists on campus,  as the Daily Illini reported.Click HERE to see the Facebook page.The page did not last long in its original incarnation, but was taken down after three hours. It has since been revived here. First, it s important to note that as long as the author or authors remain anonymous and don t come forward with an actual proposal on campus, this may all be vaporware. But with that said, it might also light off a discussion of the bizarre constructs of racism and perceived racism on America s college campuses as well as the limits of free speech and tolerance. The conversation   if it takes place   is likely to be fairly one sided. The university already weighed in with their official line, as put forward by campus spokeswoman Robin Kaler. It is disturbing and cowardly that someone would create an anonymous and senseless social media page specifically designed to intimidate others, including and especially our students. When we became aware of the page, we immediately contacted Facebook and requested that it be removed,  Kaler said in an email.  Facebook has been responsive to our requests, but the page continues to be reposted. We are continuing to work with Facebook to address this matter. We recognize that passions run deep on all sides of many issues, but actions like this are senseless and hurtful and do nothing to foster meaningful dialogue. Meanwhile, here are some of the racist and threatening tweets that were posted to the Office of Inclusion & Intercultural Relations, University Of Illinois Urbana Champagne twitter page, supposedly featuring scenes from their protests: Expect Resistance UIUC   pic.twitter.com/L5oI5CslKi  sarki (@__saada) November 18, 2015 Destroy White Supremacy Nothing to see here move along https://twitter.com/monica_alveezy/status/667057830000627712Wouldn t it just be easier to hold up a sign that says  Everyone but White lives matter?

I m sure we could have a debate about that which would drag on for years. In a more existential sense, one might argue that there are problems unique to white students, such as quota systems which undermine merit based acceptance rates or the availability of certain grants and loan programs which are race based and exclude large numbers of people from consideration. But on a day to day basis, complaining that white students are somehow discriminated against by university policy is a bit of a stretch and could set such a hypothetical student union up for ridicule, if not failure, because of the accepted conventional wisdom.But that s really the point here, isn t it? Why is it always accepted that the existence of a black student union or an Asian student union or one for women, Jews, Muslims or anyone else is the routine business of the day, but the suggestion of a white student union is immediately painted as abhorrent? Even if you re making the argument that  it s simply not needed  then you have to show us why that s a disqualifying factor. A football team isn t  needed  either if the goal of a university is to educate young minds and prepare them for the adult world, but pretty much every college in America has one.Then there s the question of Black Lives Matter, which seemed to spur this proposal whether it be fake or real. The creators of the supposed White Student Union overplay their hand considerably when their opening gambit is to label BLM as  terrorists  but the underlying text voices complaints about constant disruptions to studies and the normal affairs of campus life. Is that an unreasonable charge? As we ve seen with BLM protests all over the country, their primary goal is disruption of white spaces. (Their phrasing, not mine.) Should the campus be regularly disrupted when there are students there who are paying large sums of money to get an education, a degree and hopefully a shot at a good career?But perhaps the most challenging prospect of a discussion over a proposal like this would be to have everyone look in the mirror and ask themselves why we focus so heavily on segregating ourselves into all of these demographic pigeonholes to begin with. Rather than asking if we should ban a White Student Union, perhaps someone could ask why colleges encourage all of these other student groups based on race, gender and religion. Wasn t the goal to have a unified, color-blind society, free of discrimination based on all of these qualifiers? And if we must insist on segregated pride, perhaps it s also worth asking why anything organized with the word  white  in it is immediately defined as racist and evil when no other qualifier is treated in that fashion.

 Intelligence Committee Warns Trump: Produce Wiretapping Evidence By Monday,"Last Saturday, Donald Trump woke at the crack of dawn and went on an extraordinary Twitter tirade   even for him. He accused his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower during the hotly contested 2016 election campaign. This is a most outrageous claim to make about a former president   especially since a president cannot legally order such surveillance on any American citizen. So, if indeed Trump s claims were to turn out to be true (hint: they won t), it would have come first from a request by the FBI, and said request would have been reviewed and granted by a judge. In other words, if this did happen, it would mean that there was ample evidence that criminal activity was occurring in Trump Tower at that point in time.The worst part of this whole claim is that it was said via Twitter with absolutely no evidence whatsoever. If Trump did have evidence, surely he would have produced it by now. Well, he has also demanded that House and Senate Intelligence Committees find the evidence that he clearly does not have, and they re tired of his lies and shenanigans surrounding this issue. They are so sick of it, in fact, that they have demanded evidence of Trump s claims against President Obama be presented to them by Monday.This request comes courtesy of House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA). Schiff has called what Trump did via Twitter last Saturday  outlandish  and  destructive.  He s right. If any evidence were to exist (another hint: it doesn t) Trump or someone within the federal government would have made said evidence public by now just to kill the story.Trump has really stepped in it with this one. He flat-out lied about who is perhaps the most honorable man to ever occupy the White House. Then again   lest we forget   Trump started his political career by leading the racist birther crusade. So, we really shouldn t be surprised at his behavior here.Featured image via Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images",News,"March 12, 2017"

 Even The Secret Service Is Saying Trump Is Full Of Sh*t; There Are No Tapes,"Donald Trump is acting like a caged animal. Since around the time he fired FBI Director James Comey, he s been on the defensive. Three days after the firing, Trump, concerned that Comey would leak to the media, tweeted that he hoped there were no  tapes  of the conversations between the two.James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017Comey responded in front of the Senate by saying,  Oh Lordy, I hope there are tapes.  Well, Comey might be disappointed to learn that, at least according to the Secret Service, there aren t. Trump was bluffing. No surprise there.The Wall Street Journal issued a freedom of information request to the Secret Service, who said this: In response to your request, the Secret Service has conducted a reasonable search for responsive records,  the agency wrote.  It appears, from a review of Secret Service s main indices, that there are no records pertaining to your request that are referenced in these indices. That doesn t necessarily mean there are no tapes, but it makes it far less likely. The Secret Service is generally the department that handles Oval Office tapes. They did it for Richard Nixon and for John F. Kennedy. Trump, though, has his own personal bodyguard in the Oval Office, as well as government Secret Service.Still, it s very unlikely there is a tape. While Trump has been teasing it like it s a reality show, his staff has been evading the question.At a press conference Friday, Trump said he would reveal whether he had taped his conversations with Comey  in the very near future  and  over a fairly short period of time.  Bloomberg s Toluse Olorunnipa recently noted that Trump has often made and missed deadlines as a way of delaying or avoiding answering tough questions. Why leave open this question of whether there are tapes?  Reuters  Ayesha Rascoe asked Spicer at his press briefing Monday.  Don t the American people   Do they deserve to know whether Comey was lying to the Senate? Why leave this question open? I think the President made it clear what his intention is on Friday,  Spicer said.Source: Talking Points MemoThis wouldn t even be a question if Trump hadn t proven himself to be a serial liar.

"50-YR OLD HAITI OFFICIAL, Slated To Testify Against Clinton Foundation Corruption Next Week, Found DEAD In Miami With “Gunshot to the head”","One man was set to testify against the Clinton Foundation next week. That man was 50 year old former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein. He was found dead in his Miami home with a  gunshot to the head  that s been ruled a  suicide  by the Miami-Dade s medical examiner records supervisor. (Think Vince Foster)Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency, Fonds d assistance  conomique et social, for three years.According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8%   or $5.4 billion   was funneled to non-Haitian organizations. The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,  Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza   the Klaus Special   named after him.According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in  good spirits , with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. It s really shocking,  said Muncheez s owner Gilbert Bailly.  We grew up together; he was like family.   Your News WireAmericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to  side  with the Clinton Administration and he would  be the richest man in Haiti. He also demanded that Hillary Clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation. Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.

UNIV Of WI Chancellor Contacts Police After Noticing Confederate Flag Displayed On Worker’s Truck On Campus,"Is anyone else concerned that the Left was able to turn the display of a Confederate flag by an American into a criminal offense almost overnight? When a contractor s truck at the University of Wisconsin   LaCrosse sported a Confederate flag across its grille in November, one official was quick to condemn the contractor, call for the flag s removal, and   it turns out   even asked for an informal police investigation into the matter. E-mails obtained by the LaCrosse Tea Party show Paula Knudson, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at the school, went farther than previously known in her efforts to get the flag removed and the contractor punished.LaCrosse confederate flagUpon learning of the flag s presence on campus, Knudson e-mailed Doug Pearson, the head of Facilities Planning and Management for the school, to ask that the contractor be told the flag needed to go. The contractor quickly and willingly complied and Knudson went on to e-mail the entire UWL campus   students and faculty   to express her regret over the incident and say that she was  personally. . . offended and. . . very sorry for the fear and angst caused by its presence.  [Emphasis added]At the same time, e-mails reveal, Knudson e-mailed pictures of the truck to interim UW-LaCrosse Police Chief Scott McCullough with the subject line  License please?  After reading Knudson s campus-wide missive, McCullough responded to say he read her e-mail to mean that there was no longer any need for police action since the flag had been removed.McCullough also went on to reference another incident with yet another truck that displayed the Confederate flag and urged Knudson to remember that the police cannot run license plate numbers without a valid excuse to investigate the vehicle.  I would like to take a second and make clear that like the last truck with this emblem, I would need to be conducting a police investigation into some violation (I believe it was harassment last time) before I can run this plate,  he wrote. It could be literally only seconds talking with a complainant but it is an important protection to all of us that even the police cannot simply run records checks for no reason,  he went on to say.  Please don t take this as any hesitation on our part to help just that we have very specific rules that we (the police) need to follow. At least two students who were offended by the flag took action on their own and approached the construction site to express their indignation according to an e-mail from facilities chief Pearson.  The job site superintendent was concerned about two students who walked into the job site and confronted the trucker,  Pearson wrote in an e-mail to Knudson that included UWL Chancellor Joe Gow.  The superintendent indicated they [the students] were rude and were baiting the trucker to say something. I can help resolve these issues, but staff and students should not be walking into a job site without proper personal protective equipment. The following day, Chancellor Gow e-mailed Knudson to chide her for how she handled the situation. He urged her to point out  the trucker kindly complied  with the school s request that the flag be removed.  We need to refute the notion that we have somehow  banned  display of the confederate flag, because we don t have the legal authority to do so. And we wouldn t want to stifle free expression no matter how uncomfortable it might make us feel [emphasis added],  Gow concluded.In public statements made after Media Trackers first broke the news of the incident and published a picture of the truck, Gow said the Confederate flag  clearly is a racist symbol,  but acknowledged that UWL would have allowed the trucker to continue to display it had he refused to remove it.

 Hillary Reveals The ONE Person Who Made Her Lose… And It Isn’t Trump,"Hillary Clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results. Despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary, she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by FBI Director James Comey to interfere in the middle of the race. Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for Trump s voters,  Clinton said. Essentially, the second Comey letter played right into Trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the Washington establishment was helping Clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.  Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,  Clinton said.The former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the United States after Trump s election.The decision by Comey was blasted by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as it gave the appearance that Clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared. It also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with Clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.By contrast, Trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the Trump Foundation.The press, in concert with the FBI and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate. While the right makes claims about  liberal media  bias, it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the Republican side of the aisle and not the other.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 12, 2016"
 Check Out The New Dating Website That Caters Specifically To White Pride (IMAGES),"Let s just say that if you consider being white the best thing about yourself, you must live one sad, lonely, and pathetic life. One of these pathetic people apparently felt the need to create a  whites only  website to meet like-minded folk. And not just any website, a dating website.What is this dating website called?  Where White People Meet,  of course. Duh.Of course, they re not gonna just come out and say they re racist. They re just going to make the website, in the predominantly white state of Utah, and claim that it s just like any other dating website. Here s what it says in their  About Us!  section: We developed this dating website as an alternative to the other dating websites that cater to certain groups. We simply want to help people connect in a safe and fun online environment without costing them a ton of money. Enjoy! Except, who is it an alternative for? It looks as though, for just $4, it s an exclusive alternative for anti-gay white supremacists. It seems as though one can t search for a same-sex pairing, and the website doesn t state where it stands on polygamy.via WhereWhitePeopleMeet.com What s even more bizarre is the fact that they would advertise this  whites only  on billboards in Utah, a state that is 91.4 percent white. Is it really that hard to find other white singles in Utah? Chances are, if you run into a single person, they re going to be white. So, why bother, unless you just want to be a racist douchebag?West Valley billboard promotes Utah-based dating site geared toward white people: https://t.co/aiEKVRuMD8 pic.twitter.com/5PY1rs58pc  Salt Lake Tribune (@sltrib) December 31, 2015Of course, the website states that it has nothing to do with racism: I am sure some of you are wondering about the concept and need for a dating website titled  Where White People Meet.Com.  Our answer to that would be why not? There are various dating websites that promote and cater to just about every origin, race, religion and lifestyle out there. So again, why not  Where White People Meet.Com ? Basically, it s a  don t forget white people exist, too  website. Which is often code among white supremacists who feel they are being overrun by people born with more melanin in their skin. They have to make sure they are seen and heard. So, while they try to say things like: As you navigate the website and begin to interact with other members, please remember the golden rule of  treat others as you want to be treated.  The staff here at Where White People Meet will not tolerate rude, aggressive or racist behavior. The last thing we want it to have to remove a member of this community but please know that we will. They should be aware that creating a website in a nearly entirely white state to cater to only white people is pretty damn racist in and of itself. And while the NAACP has determined that it doesn t seem to be the work of a hate group, the whole thing just seems really weird and unnecessary. In fact, if this whole thing turned out to some satirical joke, it wouldn t at all be surprising. It s that weird.Featured image: WhereWhitePeopleMeet.com",News,"January 2, 2016"

On the second day of the couple s trip, however, their dream vacation turned into a nightmare.As Addicting Info reported here, Guerrero and Wilson stopped at a Foodland grocery store to pick up some snacks.The couple says that they were dancing and having a good time as they shopped. They held hands and at one point Wilson gave her girlfriend of two years a kiss on the cheek. Upon seeing the kiss, off-duty police officer Bobby Harrison told the couple to  stop it,  then yelled at them to  take it somewhere else. The two women tried to brush off the rude remarks and went about their shopping. Harrison continued to follow and harass the couple, threatening to have them thrown out of the store.As Wilson and Guerrero neared the checkout, Harrison approached them again. At this point, Wilson tried to call 911 on the off-duty cop, but Harrison grabbed her arm. Both women were thrown to the ground by the officer. Wilson was punched in the face by Harrison. The officer then directed Foodland employees to hold the two women down until their hands could be zip tied.Harrison arrested the couple, charging them with felony assault on a police officer. The charges were dropped five months later. During the five months that it took the courts to process the case, Wilson and Guerrero were forced to remain in Honolulu. We spent the money we came with on bail,  Wilson said during a recent press conference. As a result, the couple was forced to sleep in a park.Watch Wilson and Guerrero describe the harassment and assault in the video below, courtesy of NBC News on YouTube.On Friday, the women were awarded an $80,000 settlement in the case.

FBI UNDERCOVER Informant On Hillary’s 2010 Sale Of Uranium Identified,"The FBI informant who went undercover to look into Hillary Clinton s role in an Obama administration-era uranium company was identified yesterday in an exclusive from Reuters:William Campbell, a Russian lobbyist, is the informant, according to Reuters. He will be testifying before a congressional committee about the 2010 sale of Uranium One, where a Russian-backed company bought a uranium firm with mines in the U.S. Campbell gave information to the FBI about what he saw while undercover as an informant. I have worked with the Justice Department undercover for several years, and documentation relating to Uranium One and political influence does exist and I have it    William CampbellCongressional committees have previously tried to interview Campbell, as he was undercover for roughly five years, working to get information on Russia s efforts to grow its atomic energy business in the U.S.Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told The Hill that a deal was reached in late October, clearing the informant to talk to Congress for the first time   almost eight years after he first went undercover.Two House chairmen also announced a probe in late October which is digging into new reports about Russian efforts to influence the Uranium One nuclear purchase that gave Russia control of roughly 20 percent of America s uranium.When Clinton served as secretary of state, Russia routed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, and former President Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees as part of Russian efforts to influence the U.S. government to approve the deal, The Hill reported.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE GAG ORDER THAT HAS BEEN LIFTED BY SESSIONS:LAWYER FOR FBI INFORMANT: My Client Knows What Russians Were Saying During Bribery of Clintons [VIDEO]Campbell s attorney, Victoria Toensing, said on Fox Business that former attorneys general under the Obama administration are the reason her client hasn t been able to  tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all these bribery payments were made. The lawyer for the FBI informant under a gag order that prevents him from going before Congress spoke out about what s to come with the Clinton/Russia Uranium story:Fox Business reported: An informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is under a gag order that prevents him from testifying before the United States Congress that Russian nuclear officials were involved in fraudulent dealings in 2009 before the Uranium One deal was approved.Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch blocked the informant from testifying last year and threatened criminal action against him if he were to do so.In an interview with FOX Business  Lou Dobbs, Victoria Toensing, the attorney representing the FBI informant, said she has never heard of a criminal penalty for breaching a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). If it does and it is unconstitutional and it s invalid, if it prohibits my client from giving information to the legislature, the executive cannot say to people,  Hey, you can t give information to another body of the government,  Toensing said.KEY POINTS: The Republican leadership was blocking the investigation into both Benghazi and the Russia uranium scandal involving Clinton.The NDA (gag order) is unconstitutional and Toensing says this type of gag order has a criminal penalty. She says she s never heard of this type of gag order.Victoria Toensing is one of the best lawyers in DC and will get to the bottom of this one way or another.

Paul Craig Roberts: ‘By Cooperating with Washington on Syria & Russia Walked Into a Trap’," By Paul Crag RobertsA month ago I wrote a column ,  He Who Hesitates Is Lost And Russia Hesitated.  The consequences of this hesitation are now apparent:1. A UN report orchestrated by Washington has accused Syria and Russia of war crimes in Aleppo. According to the report,  indiscriminate airstrikes across the eastern part of the city by Government forces and their allies [Russia] are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualties. These violations constitute war crimes. And if knowingly committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against civilians, they constitute crimes against humanity. The UN Human Rights Council has now voted to start an  independent  investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to indict Russia and Putin as war criminals and to  bring to justice those responsible for the alleged abuses.  Moreover,  the situation should be urgently referred to the International Criminal Court. Every party to this conflict must know that they will be held accountable for the international crimes they commit   all, without selective protection or discrimination.  Keep in mind that Washington provides the largest share of the UN s budget, and the UN will overlook that it was Washington that sent ISIS to Aleppo.Obviously, neither Washington nor the UN will be able to drag Putin into the International Criminal Court, but a war criminal charge can serve Washington s purpose by stopping Putin from traveling abroad and curtailing his diplomatic efforts. The purpose of this orchestrated exercise is its propaganda value. Among Washington s many concerns is that some Eastern European countries, alarmed by the conflict that Washington is leading them into with Russia, will threaten NATO with a non-participation statement. If Russia is branded a war criminal, it becomes even more difficult for countries that foolishly and thoughtlessly joined NATO to extricate themselves from the consequences.2. Washington has succeeded in bringing to power in Poland the far right-wing Law and Justice Party. These agents of Washington have re-opened the matter of the death of Poland s President Kaczynski in a plane crash, making wild claims that the crash was a terror attack by Russia aimed at depriving Poland of its political leadership. Despite massive and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Law and Justice Party s claims will find traction thanks to the scary portrait of Russia painted by Washington s demonization campaign. The intended result is to further blacken and isolate Russia and its government.3. As the anointed spokesperson for the neoconservative warmongers, Hillary wants Washington to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria. A no-fly zone would require Washington to attempt to prevent Syrian and Russian air strikes against ISIS positions. It seems clear enough that Syria and Russia would not accept any attempt to deny Syria the use of the country s own airspace in the conflict against forces sent by Washington to overthrow the Syrian government, as happened to Gaddafi in Libya. Unless Russia and Syria surrender, Hillary s no-fly zone would result in military conflict between Russia and the US.To advance the no-fly zone proposal, the  use of chemical weapons  ruse has been resurrected. Fabricated reports are appearing that the Syrian air force is guilty of dropping chemical weapons on the Syrian population. On October 22, the Indian Express reported that on October 21 the UN-Led Joint Investigative Mechanism informed the UN Security Council that the chemical attack on Qmenas  was caused by a Syrian Arab Armed Forces helicopter dropping a device from a high altitude which hit the ground and released the toxic substance that affected the population.  The report concluded that three of the chemical attacks investigated were made by Syria and one by the Islamic State.The fact that the Russians resolved the chemical weapons issue in 2014, a year before the alleged attack on Qmenas, by taking possession of the weapons and removing them from Syria means that the report has little credibility. However, at no time during Washington s 15-year-old attack on Muslim countries have facts played any role, and certainly facts have played no role in Washington s demonization of Russia.4. Diana Johnstone has concluded that Hillary intends regime change for Russia and will use the presidency for that purpose.It is impossible to imagine a purpose more reckless and irresponsible. Many members of the Russian government have stated that Washington s provocation and demonization of Russia have brought trust between the nuclear powers close to zero and that Russia will never again fight a war on her own territory Continue this article at The Institute for Political EconomyREAD MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia Files",US_News,"October 26, 2016"
CUBANS BRUTALLY ATTACK Brave Man Waving US Flag In Front Of Communist Parade [Video],"This is what having no freedom of speech looks like This guy is awesome! I use whatever flag I want because I am free. I am not a hypocrite, not like all the Cubans marching yesterday [the 2016 May Day march]   all those Cubans are hypocrites,  he told his detractors. He went on to praise the U.S. flag as the  pride of the Americans  and assert,  I don t fear the government. Daniel Llorente is the brave pro-American Cuban dissident who interrupted Monday s May Day parade in Havana, running in front of the marching throngs waving an American flag. A communist mob attacked him, beating him and dragging him away.The man, identified as Daniel Llorente, has previously waged similar protests against the communist regime of dictator Ra l Castro and has expressed vocally his support for the American government.Video of the incident shows that Llorente took off running in front of the throngs, waving an American flag before the likeness of mass murderer Ernesto  Che  Guevara in the Plaza of the Revolution, waiting to march just moments before the May Day parade was to begin, shouting anti-government slogans. A group of men waiting on the sidelines, who have not been identified in reports, restrained, beat, and dragged Llorente away. Every major Cuban government leader, including dictator Castro, was in attendance.The Miami-based outlet Mart  Noticias identified the man as Llorente, a freelance cab driver and dissident, but does not belong to any dissident organizations. Instead, he has used his American flag to protest on previous occasions by waving it before public congregations. A year ago, Llorente protested before a crowd awaiting the first American cruise ship s arrival in Havana, the Adonia. Llorente greeted the ship waving an American flag and shouting  Yes we can! , the famous slogan of President Barack Obama s first presidential campaign. The government organized a rabble to berate Llorente with racial epithets, and Llorente responded by asserting his freedom.Read more: Breitbart",Government News,"May 2, 2017"

OOPS! LIST OF TOP 10 CORPORATE TAX DODGERS Are All Hillary Donors…Compliments Of Bernie Sanders,"The hypocrisy of our media is astounding! What about Hillary s major corporate donors like GE for example, that have been working the loopholes in our tax system for decades? Does anyone care that Hillary has been taking money from some of America s biggest corporate tax dodgers for several years? Bernie Sanders recently outed the 10 biggest multinational corporations that paid no federal taxes for at least one year between 2008 and 2012. Sanders has made reining in corporate tax dodgers a key point of his presidential platform. In a recent press release, the Sanders campaign laid out the Vermont senator s plans to force multinational corporations to pay their fair share in taxes:As it turns out, all ten of those same companies are some of Hillary Clinton s biggest donors, whether to her campaign or to her family foundation.1. GENERAL ELECTRIC According to data from the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), GE posted $33.9 billion in U.S. profits, yet somehow got $2.9 billion in refunds in that same time period. According to the book Clinton Cash, then-Secretary of State Clinton lobbied the Algerian government for a GE power plant contract. After Algeria awarded the contract to GE, Jeffrey Immelt   CEO of GE   gave a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Sanders also pointed out that while Immelt sat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, the Fed gave GE $16 billion in financial assistance.2. BOEING Boeing is one of the nation s biggest corporate tax dodgers, making over $20 billion in profits between 2008 and 2012 and paying an overall income tax rate of negative one percent during those years. Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer noted that after Secretary Clinton successfully lobbied the Russian government to enter into a $3.7 billion contract to buy Boeing s aircraft, the aerospace company gave the Clinton Foundation a hefty donation of $900,000.3. VERIZON In the four years between 2008 and 2012, Verizon pocketed over $30 billion in profits and paid a tax rate of -1.8 percent, according to CTJ. The Sanders campaign s research claims that in 2012 alone, Verizon would have paid $630 million in income taxes had they been unable to stash U.S. profits in offshore tax havens.Verizon has given between $118,000 and $300,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years. And as Zaid Jilani reported in Alternet last year, Hillary Clinton is the favored candidate of numerous Verizon executives, many of whom have given the maximum donation to her 2016 effort:Verizon vice-presidents Lydia Pulley, Kathleen Grillo, and Donna Epps each gave $2,700 to Hillary for America. Verizon senior vice-president Thomas Edwards and vice-president Chris Debosier pitched in $1,000. Leecia Eve, a former Hillary staffer who today is a lobbyist for Verizon gave $2,700. Another Verizon lobbyist, David Lamendola, gave Hillary $1,000.To contrast, Sanders appeared at a rally for striking Verizon workers in New York City last year, demanding the company meet the workers  demands and admonishing its executives for the company s greedy practices.4. BANK OF AMERICA In 2010, Bank of America got a whopping $1.9 billion refund from the IRS despite making $4.4 billion in profit. And the Institute for Policy Studies reported that Bank of America has over 300 foreign subsidiaries in countries and territories universally known as tax havens, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.In his recent groundbreaking report for The Intercept, Jilani reported that Bank of America paid Hillary Clinton $225,000 in speaking fees after her tenure as Secretary of State.5. CITIGROUP Citigroup was the largest recipient of federal bailout money, getting an astonishing $2.5 trillion after the financial crisis even though they played a major role in the financial meltdown. Citi also paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2010 despite making profits in excess of $4 billion. Had the bank been unable to utilize offshore tax havens, it would have paid $11.5 billion in federal taxes in 2012.According to campaign finance database OpenSecrets.org, Citigroup is Hillary Clinton s top donor, having given over $824,000 in campaign contributions throughout her political career.6. PFIZER The Connecticut-based pharmaceutical giant is notorious for its tax avoidance strategies, paying $0 in federal income tax between 2010 and 2012 and getting a $2.2 billion tax refund despite posting $43 billion in global profits.Pfizer executives gave nearly $40,000 to Clinton s presidential campaign between April and September 2015. And Pfizer itself has given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to donor records obtained by the Washington Times.7. FEDEX In 2011, FedEx made $2.7 billion in profit, yet they were given a $135 million tax refund from the IRS that same year. FedEx also receives $1 billion a year in corporate welfare from the U.S. Post Office   its chief competitor   to use its aircraft to transport U.S. mail.FedEx has given anywhere between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The company was also one of four corporations to bundle a $2.5 million donation to Clinton s new diplomacy center (Boeing was another).8. HONEYWELL Despite making over $3 billion in combined profits between 2009 and 2010, Honeywell paid $0 in federal income taxes and got roughly $510 million in refunds. Honeywell CEO David Cote was also one of the loudest voices on the Fix The Debt campaign, calling for the Social Security and Medicare age to be raised to 70.Honeywell, a prominent weapons manufacturer, also gave $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. At the same time, Honeywell and others had their weapons shipped to countries blasted by international watchdogs for their deplorable records on human rights.9. MERCK Merck is one of the nation s largest pharmaceutical companies and biggest tax dodgers   in 2009, Merck pocketed $5.7 billion in profits, yet paid $0 in federal taxes. Merck successfully got out of paying $18.69 billion in federal taxes in 2012 by stashing $53.4 billion of its U.S. profits in overseas tax havens.The Center for Responsive Politics reports that Merck donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation after becoming a member of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2006. It also spent millions on lobbying the U.S. State Department during Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State.10. CORNING CTJ reports that between 2008 and 2012, Corning made over $3.4 billion in profits and got a $10 million tax refund, paying a 0.1 percent federal tax rate. The Sanders campaign pointed out that Corning CEO Wendell Weeks has called for the retirement age to be raised to 70, while he himself has a $22.8 million retirement account.While Clinton headed up the State Department, Corning lobbied heavily for multiple policies on which it stood to reap financial gains, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton, in turn, lobbied China to lower tariffs on the type of goods manufactured by Corning. The company has also donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation and paid the former Secretary of State $225,000 in speaking fees after she announced her presidential campaign.

 White Catholic Schoolkids Threaten To Lynch Black Classmate (VIDEO),"An as yet unconfirmed number of white students of a Catholic school in California have been suspended after sending a video to a black student threatening a lynching.The Modesto Bee reports:A racist death threat video posted on social media by a Central Catholic High junior has led to the suspension of students involved and a criminal investigation, but an African American community group is calling for calm while police do their work. People are asking me,  What can I do?,  but I want to find out what s been done, first. Let the natural process take its course,  said attorney Jacq Wilson, who is working with the family of the boy targeted in the video.Efforts to dismiss the incident as a high school prank fell on deaf ears in the community. As Wilson puts it: When has bullying ever been a joke? When has a death threat ever been a joke? Right now, with everything going on (nationally), what were they waiting for, for someone to die? The fact is that people are hurt. People are scared. It s a hate crime. It s possibly even a domestic act of terrorism. It s a criminal threat, It is also reassuring that Central Catholic High President Jim Pecchenino came out immediately with his own unambiguous statement on the matter. Students involved in that video have been suspended. They are not on our campus. We ll follow our process for discipline,  he said. The whole video is despicable, every part of it.

Do we really need to import rapists and violent criminals who have no valid identification or past criminal history, so they can steal from working Americans as well?An Afghan who claimed to be just 12 is revealed to be in his twenties after assaulting his British foster father.The Afghan teen, who had arrived in Britain illegally via Calais, was actually registered as a child but after a dental examination found that he had rotting wisdom teeth, a dentist suggested he was more likely to be an adult.The revelation came after another British carer also reported that she was sexually assaulted by an alleged teen she was looking after.MPs have now called for new rules regarding age assessment for immigrants despite a petition backed by celebrities such as actor Benedict Cumberbatch and Virgin tycoon Richard Branson saying that refugee children should be reunited with their British relatives.If they enter Britain as children, asylum seekers are immediately put into the care of social services which often leaves youngsters separated from their parents for long periods of time.Conservative MP for Monmouth David Davies spoke to MailOnline about an attack on one of his female constituents who was looking after the  12-year-old  immigrant.The Afghan was taken in by the Welsh foster family but refused to live by their rules and would skip school and disappear for long periods.He told social services that he wished to move to Bristol but when told he would have to live with a foster family, he became angry and attacked his foster father.It was after the fracas that the man s phone was confiscated and indecent images of children and visits to Jihadi websites were found.Mr Davies said:  They did a dental check on him and discovered that his wisdom teeth were rotting. The dentist said he had to be in at least his 20s but the Home Office strike people down to 16 if they don t know what their age is for certain, so he was listed as 16.

 Republicans Just RUINED Trump’s Plan To Bully The Government Into Funding Border Wall (DETAILS),"Donald Trump has just been screwed over by members of his own party, thanks to his insistence on a border wall that is absolutely pointless and won t actually work.At Congress has been at a standstill over including Trump s border wall in government spending, Republican lawmakers are now agreeing with Democrats by supporting a  clean  spending bill so the government won t have to stop working on Friday. This push takes Trump s border wall out of the running for funding.Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) said: Ideological litmus tests on a spending bill like this simply create partisan roadblocks. With so many pressing issues facing our country, we need to work together to keep the lights on and avoid another expensive shutdown that weakens not only our economy but our national security. Mick Mulvaney, who is Trump s budget director, tried to make a deal with Congress by promising that Obamacare would get more funding if Trump s wall was funded. Clearly okay with manipulating Americans into funding a wall that no one wants, Mulvaney said: We d offer them $1 of CSR [Obamacare] payments for $1 of wall payments. Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues. No one in the Democratic party actually wants this border wall to be funded   and Chuck Schumer pointed out exactly why. These are points that even Republicans can t argue with:A spokesman for Schumer blasted the Trump administration for trying to use Obamacare to bribe lawmakers into funding Trump s wall: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.The US government is supposed to take care of its citizens and, according to the President, Mexico is supposed to pay for the wall. If the administration would drop their 11th hour demand for a wall that Democrats, and a good number of Republicans oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal. Trump needs to just admit that the border wall he promised his brainless supporters was a flawed idea, and it is only going to cost America in the end.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
"Senator Hatch to Healthcare Protesters: ‘If You Want a Hearing, You Better Shut Up’ [Video]","The Senate Finance Committee hearing for the Republican Graham-Cassidy health care bill became a screaming protest today.

Sen. Orrin Hatch responded to protestors whose shouting prevented the hearing s start, saying,  If you want a hearing, you better shut up. I d like to welcome everyone, and I do mean everyone,  Finance Committee Chairman Hatch said, referencing the large crowd of protestors.A protestor started screaming something unintelligible. Well if we re gonna,  Hatch began before the chants grew louder. If you want a hearing, you better shut up,  Hatch said, pounding his gavel. Let the police take care of it,  Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) quietly told Hatch. Oh, I will. I will,  Hatch said.After a brief period of more chanting by protestors, Hatch turned to Grassley and asked,  What are they saying? Don t touch the Medicaid, save our  Grassley said before trailing off, clearly unsure of what the last part of the chant was supposed to be.The chant in question was,  Don t touch the Medicaid, save our liberty. The Senate has been expected to vote on the latest Obamacare repeal effort before the end of the month. Opposition has mounted against the bill, however, and with Republican Sen. John McCain already a definite  no,  and others doubtful, the bill s future is uncertain.Read more: WFB",politics,"Sep 25, 2017"
 Former Republican Senator Endorses Hillary Clinton After Orlando Shooting,"After the horrific attacks that claimed 50 lives and wounded 53 others in Orlando, the nation was given two options: a leader who would respond with swift, collected action, or a reality TV host whose answer is (again) to ban all Muslims.Well that was enough for one former Republican Senator. After listening to the two different candidates, Larry Pressler, who served in the United States Senate from South Dakota for 18 years, decided he would be endorsing Hillary Clinton for the presidency.The moderate Republican, who lost reelection to Democrat Tim Johnson, arrived at the decision after coming to the conclusion that the United States need complete universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons after the shooting. He was even shocked at himself for endorsing Clinton:I can t believe I m endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, but I am. This morning I woke up and told my wife,  Did I really do that?  But I did. If someone had told be 10 years ago I would do this, I wouldn t have believed them.Pressler slammed Donald Trump for his Nazi German rhetoric and the Republican Party over stonewalling gun control conversations, saying the party is disenfranchising him and other Republicans who want to see change.We need to go the route of more gun control as a result of Orlando and all the other shootings that have occurred. But it s almost as though Republicans are saying gun control shouldn t be part of the conversation at all   This election is starting to sound like the German elections in the late 1920s. This is a very dangerous national conversation we re slipping into.Pressler, a Mormon, also says Trump is making Mormons uneasy over his rhetoric, and says he knows all too well what religion persecution brings.Republicans have lost another of their own due to Trump s dangerous demagoguery, and more will certainly follow.

WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE 2006 SECURE BORDER FENCE ACT?,"Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank Obama and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.OBAMA CLAIMED: We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.THE  SECURE FENCE ACT The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh.PROMINENT REPUBLICAN FROM TEXAS:The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried. Via: The Lid",Government News,"Aug 16, 2015"

 GOP Will IMMEDIATELY Defund Planned Parenthood In Same Bill That Abolishes Obamacare,"Well, it s happening. If you  voted your conscience  or  refused to support a criminal  who is not an actual criminal, voted for Jill Stein if you just couldn t handle a Hillary Clinton presidency because reasons, cast  protest votes for Donald Trump, or   against his wishes   Bernie Sanders, you now get to say that you own a piece of history. That s right, for the low, low price of your dignity, you managed to buy yourself a Donald Trump presidency   the one where healthcare is stripped from the most vulnerable Americans, and women s health services go the way of slavery (except if 20% of Donald Trump voters had their way, slavery would make a comeback).In the end, while Hillary Clinton took a historic, almost three million vote lead over Trump, it all came down to about 78,000 votes in three states  44,292 in Pennsylvania, 22,748 in Wisconsin, and 10,704 in Michigan. To put it in perspective for  conscience voters,  quadrennial fake liberal hero, Jill Stein, earned herself 49,901 in Pennsylvania, 31,072 in Wisconsin, and 51,493 in Michigan.Stein and supporters said repeatedly that their goal was to defeat Hillary Clinton, and they did   all while helping Donald Trump win. Now the causes they, like many of the rest of us, champion, are in danger.On Thursday, the GOP announced the beginning of what will almost assuredly be a glorious, thousand-year Reich, when they laid out their plans to gut Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood in the same bill. The Hill reports that the situation is exactly as bad as was predicted by those  establishment stooges  who had the gall to vote for the woman who had the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, rather than sling diapers at the wall for almost a year and join in the propagation of untrue right-wing propaganda:Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that defunding Planned Parenthood will be included as part of a bill to repeal ObamaCare.Ryan said cutting off federal funds to the organization will be included in a  reconciliation  bill that also repeals the core of ObamaCare. The reconciliation process prevents Democrats from launching a filibuster against the measure, meaning Republicans won t need 60 votes to win on defunding. Planned Parenthood legislation will be in our reconciliation bill,  Ryan said, without providing any more details.Currently, Republicans would be hard-pressed to lay out any actual plan to replace Obamacare   because there isn t one. But that isn t stopping them from undoing the good work of Barack Obama s administration. Their goal over the next four years will not be to help you or anyone else. Their goal will be the same as it was when Obama was first elected   to erase the legacy of our first African-American President, and to undo any good that he has done. Isn t that, after all, the true meaning of  Make America Great Again? The worst part is that if we, the people who are supposed to be the adults in the room, had simply united behind the most qualified candidate, we could have prevented this.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images",News,"January 5, 2017"
WATCH: DIVISIVE FORMER First Lady MICHELLE OBAMA Can’t Let Go Of Race-Obsession: People “Don’t Trust Politics” Because Republicans Are All “White Men”,"Michelle Obama is hands-down, the most divisive first lady to ever occupy our nation s White House. The woman who was never proud of her country until her husband was elected President, lived a very comfortable life as the First Lady in the nation s White House. She took regular 5-star vacations, that included her tax-supported live-in mother, friends, relatives, and of course, her daughters, who attended the best schools in Washington DC. After 8 long years of acting as the First Lady of the United States of America, it s actually quite sad to see Michelle travel around from venue to venue, explaining to her audiences how she s still a victim of racism or sexism Tuesday at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, former first lady Michelle Obama said when she attended the State of the Union address she would notice the Republican side was  all men, all white,  and that was why she argued many people of color  don t trust politics. Speaking about diversity, Obama said,  We should be working actively to mix it up, so we re getting a real broad range of perspectives on every issue. Shoot, I would see that in Congress. She explained,  At the State of the Union address   when you are in the room what you can see is this real dichotomy. It s a feeling of color almost. On one side of the room is literally gray and white. Literally, that is the color palette on one side of the room. On the other side of the room, there are yellows and blues and whites and greens. Physically, there s a difference in color, in the tone, because on one side all men, all white, on the other side some woman, some people of color. She continued,  I look at that, and I go, no wonder. No wonder we struggle, no wonder people don t trust politics. We re not even noticing what these rooms look like.

 Trump’s Ignorance Is Going To Turn The GOP Convention Into A World Class Clusterf*ck," In a little over two weeks, the Republican Party will hold its convention to, hypothetically, name Donald Trump as the official nominee. Conventions are usually three day long infomercials that whip up the base and kick off the tone of the campaign for the general public. They re masterpieces of propaganda with the agenda scheduled down to the minute.But that was before Donald Trump.With just a few days left before the big weekend, no one knows who is speaking, who is attending or, seriously, how much time Trump himself will spend at his own nomination:Much of the program remains in flux, including who will speak, how and when Mr. Trump will arrive, and what he will say when he does.And after months of promising that his convention would be special, and not  boring  like previous ones, Mr. Trump says he is now embracing a less-is-more approach.One thing there will be less of, which might come as a surprise to anyone expecting all the brashness and ubiquity of Trump branding, is the candidate himself.Trump is refusing to speak all three days of the convention. You know, HIS convention. Apparently he just can t be bothered. He s worried people will think he s  grandstanding.  Because Donald trump is all about moderation and humility. Said no one ever.But part of the problem, OK, MOST of the problem, is Trump himself. No one wants to be seen endorsing him and Trump literally has no idea what the hell he is doing:At one point, two aides confirmed, Mr. Trump was not even aware that the event had to be held in Cleveland, a decision made almost two years ago by the Republican National Committee.That s the kind of statement that drives Republican operatives to straight up alcoholism. Or suicide. Or both.Very few prominent Republicans have agreed to take the stage to support Trump and Trump, being the pettiest of men, has declared that he will try to block people like Ted Cruz and John Kasich from speaking unless they bend the knee to him, a most unlikely occurance.Trump is still promising to have big celebrity names at his coronation in lieu of big political names but he s become so toxic, it s hard to imagine anyone who is not already deeply ensconced in right wing culture showing up. Ted Nugent would happily get on stage to shout about guns and Muslims but his appeal is limited to inbred yokels and ammosexuals.On top of all of this, Trump still doesn t have much in the way of a campaign organization. He s just winging it and assuming his sheer awesomeness will win the day. But at this rate, his campaign, already on life support from his numerous gaffes, scandals and general idiocy, will be DOA out of the starting gate and it s not clear that Trump would be able to recover from the impending disaster his debut is shaping up to be.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"July 1, 2016"
After The 2016 Election: A Gullible and Shattered America," David Kerans Strategic CultureBoth inside the US and around the world, political observers have been waiting a long time for an election that would promise relief from the most noxious features of the American system. Alas, while it is high time that the US lead the way in reversing these trends, the outcome of the 18 month struggle to elect a new administration looks likely to scuttle all hopes for serious leadership and reform. I m looking forward to a market crash to awaken the electorate out of our rut, honestly. Because if a Loony Tunes candidate {meaning Donald Trump   DK} doesn t give Democrats the courage to put up a push-left candidate {Bernie Sanders, or some facsimile   DK}, then catastrophe is the only correction we have left.   Commenter  Snapshotist Both inside the US and around the world, political observers have been waiting a long time for an election that would promise relief from the most noxious features of the American system, such as neoliberal economic austerity policies that hamstring governments  ability to maintain basic services and safety nets, military aggression and destabilization of regimes across a wide swathe of the globe, wholesale violation of privacy via NSA surveillance, trade agreements designed to maximize the power of international corporations over national governments, facilitation of fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure in the face of dire climate change consequences, a financial system sucking wealth away from the population and accelerating wealth inequality, and more.Alas, while it is high time that the US lead the way in reversing these trends, the outcome of the 18 month struggle to elect a new presidential administration looks likely to scuttle all hopes for serious leadership and reform on any of these critical issues. It follows, therefore, that in the near term (if not longer), progress will not be possible unless new forms of politics arise to deliver pressure from below on Washington, DC.

 PA Archbishop Accused Of Using Mafia-Like Tactics Against Lawmaker,"Philadelphia s archbishop Charles Caput is accused of using mafia-like tactics against a state lawmaker who stands in support of child victims of sexual abuse.In an email to Pennsylvania state representative Jamie Santora, the archbishop accused the elected official of  betraying the church.  The email went on to say that Santora would suffer  consequences  for supporting legislation designed to provide victims of child sexual abuse with the justice they deserve.The bill which provoked the vicious message from Caput would extend the amount of time that child sexual assault victims have to bring claims against their abusers.Under the state s current law a victim of sexual assault only has until his or her 30th birthday to file a claim against the abuser. The legislation, which passed the state s lower house in April, would extend the deadline until the victim s 50th birthday.According to The Intellectualist, Caput is heading up a lobbying effort against the bill.The email provoked the wrath of state lawmakers on both sides of political aisle.Republican state legislator Mike Vereb, who is also a Catholic, accused the archbishop of using  mafia-like tactics  against lawmakers, saying: This mob boss approach of having legislators called out, he really went right up to the line. He is going down a road that is frankly dangerous for the status of the church in terms of it being a non-profit. The Catholic church has no business engaging in any type of lobbying activity. In order to maintain its tax-exempt status, a church is strictly prohibited from engaging in political activity.The letter that Caput sent out is a prime example of the kind of religious bullying the Establishment Clause was put in place to prevent.Given the Catholic Church s history of child sexual abuse, Caput s email accusing Santora of  betraying the church  would indicate that the church is aware that many more victims exist.It seems clear that the church would prefer those victims never receive the justice they deserve.Image credit via Michal on Flickr",News,"June 19, 2016"

The dormancy of over three decades, and the miseries that the United States has put dozens of nations through, have begun to cease. The torment that the Vietnamese went through and the innocent lives that perished under US drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan are beginning to find their answers.  But not in international tribunals or world system of justice. No. In people s conscious, the great divide in the American population is the first sure sign of a change to come.Ever since the unwelcome appearance of Donald Trump on the US governmental scene, the first president not to be placed into position by the deep state, the inquisition over what is going on has begun.Americans, more than ever are perplexed about their future. Their past is vague, and no matter how hard they peer into the rear view mirror   for those Americans, it doesn t make sense.9/11 doesn t make sense.The occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan doesn t make sense.The admittance to not finding any WMDs in Iraq and yet occupying it, doesn t make sense.To cause the deaths of 500, 000 children, and say it was worth the kill by the administrators   doesn t make sense.The cover-up for 9/11 doesn t make sense. To start a global war on terror and not explain how 9/11 occurred, or how a third building collapsed nine hours later, doesn t make sense.Obama s sudden appearance on the scene, doesn t make sense.The hundreds of books and articles that question the mechanism of the selection of Obama and never discussing them on the mainstream media, doesn t make sense.Obama placed in that position by the establishment, by the deep state, doesn t make sense.The blanked out middle-class of America, still pondering what happened, doesn t make sense.The fact that they lost their jobs beginning three decades ago, and having had to let go of their comfortable insured life working in an American factory, doesn t make sense.The abandoned factories and grand industries that once made America great, lying obsolete and deserted, doesn t make sense.Half of Detroit abandoned and deserted, doesn t make sense.The media cheering on its hallucinatory concussions all throughout these disasters, doesn t make sense.The PTSD ed war veterans and the official suicide rates of US soldiers on and off duty, go undetected and barely seen in the rear view mirror of the media, never make sense.All the common man sees today is one man attacked by the same mass  media that pushed them into the illegal wars and illegitimate debts from zero to $20 trillion, between 1979-2017, by some estimates.But the  buck stops here  as President Eisenhower once famously said. The heavy train loaded with old rusted debris is coming to a screeching halt. Meanwhile the curious are looking wide-eyed. NATO doesn t know where it really stands.  The think tanks of Washington   the hub of all mesmerizing strategies   are vacant, or their curtains half drawn. The Neocons are contemplating plan B. The  Israeli firsters  are caught off guard. They are planning ahead of time desperately. But whose ears do they have this time?! A man who calls the weapons of the think tanks, the mainstream media,  liars  ,  fake news !?Once the invisible sword, the likes of New York Times and CNN are today exposed and blunted. Who dared call CNN  liars ?! CNN engaged America meticulously into two  fake  wars which indebted the United States, and still avoided any blame. It was almost scripted and storyboarded like a Hollywood movie. Now, it is still loose, with acrobatic skills evading all detection like a skilled serial killer breathing in our civilized world.Now the eye-opening process has begun. Watch out for the six-packers and their evaporated illusions! You have finally awaken the slumbering slave of America, and awakened they are Alas! All empires go through these stages.  The awkward moments must be tolerated i.e. the president without a cabinet, the supporters with semi-automatic weapons guarding his speeches in Georgia and Florida. The anti-Semitic accusations that are being discussed in the morning regular sessions on CNN. The angry obliterated Alan Dershowitz who is nervously accusing CNN s moderator Don Lemon, of giving the anti-Semites their fifteen minutes of fame. They fear that it will catch fire on the colleges and universities.The masquerade however is over. The Paul Wolfowitzs, the Richard Perles, the Daniel Pipes have to face the masses. The not-so-innocent masses that succumbed to the beast s demands also wait. The confrontation lingers silently.  No one even knows these people  as Thomas Friedman of the New York Times once famously said in his interviews with the Haaretz. Twenty Five Neocons have planned and executed what has happened in the past two and a half decades.The wakeup call has rung, the moment of illusion has disappeared.

" White House Gives Up Trying To Control Trump, Lawyers Are Ready To Quit (TWEETS)","Ever since his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has proven himself to be a loose cannon that no one can control. Trump s administration should have known better than to try and reign him in, and to have any hopes that he might be able to restrain himself once he won the election. Perhaps they would be handling his behavior better now, instead of abandoning the disgraceful POTUS.At the moment when Trump s Russia scandal is exploding and he needs his team more than ever, the White House has had it with Trump s incriminating Twitter rants. They once tried to control Trump in various ways such as keeping his schedule tight and only feeding him pro-Trump news, but now they re letting Trump do whatever the hell he wants. To make this even worse for the abandoned man baby in the White House, his lawyers are also at their wit s end. Because no one is controlling Trump, he s become impossible to defend as he continues to make his scandals worse.Gabriel Sherman stated:This basically seals the deal   Trump is going down. Not that his team has ever been very successful at keeping him level-headed, but now that they re deliberately taking a hands off approach, he is doomed. His lawyers cannot possibly compete with the amount of damaging tweets Trump puts out every week, proving to the world that no one can take him down better than the man himself. Trump is an absolute nightmare for a legal team, as he repeatedly sabotages all efforts to mend his scandals.No one should be surprised that this is how Trump s administration is going down. The entire staff is made up of incompetent people who can t stand up to Trump   and he knows it. The administration was dysfunctional from day one, and proved unable to reach Trump and convince him that shutting up was his best option. Now, Trump is left to his own devices with attorneys who don t even know how they re going to save him anymore.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"June 18, 2017"

Please stop!Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way.I know you have children and two daughters.Can you imagine Ivanka or Tiffany in Myeshia s shoes?Having a fight with the commander in chief while they are pregnant and grieving?If Myeshia Johnson is mad at you, take it.Just as President Bush and others did.Take it.It s part of what YOU signed up for when you decided to descend that escalator and throw your hat in the ring for president.You re commander in chief, the president of the United States of America, the greatest country on Earth.Act like it.Act like you know that you re big enough not to have to win every fight or respond to every criticism.Act like you know where the high road is.Confident and secure people ask for help, and for forgiveness.Insecure people think they know everything and need no help.Lemon went on to call La David Johnson a  hero  and said that he is a  role model  to him as an  awesome soldier, a great man, and a great American. After Lemon read his open letter, he introduced a CNN panel but had to stop for a few seconds to compose himself after he appeared to be crying.

KATHY GRIFFIN Actually BRAGGED About Wanting To “Beat Down” 11-Yr Old Barron Trump 6 Months Ago,"The outspoken liberal comedian posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields in which she was seen holding a bloodied mask of President Trump.Donald Trump was quick to condemn her on Twitter:TMZ later reported that 11-year old Barron Trump actually saw the image of his bloodied and decapitated father while watching TV.TMZ reports: Barron Trump was watching TV & saw @kathygriffin holding the severed head. He thought it was his dad. My heart is broken.  Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) May 31, 2017Melania Trump weighed in on the horrific image her 11-yr old son was subjected to with this statement:  As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing. When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it. It s a question a lot of comedians are asking themselves lately: What should comedy look like during the Trump presidency? Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities,  Kathy Griffin told Vulture at the Equality Now Gala Tuesday night.  For me, that s Trump and all things Trump. It s not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down. It s his turn. So I m happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump   and also to Barron. You know a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald, my edge is that I ll go direct for Barron. I m going to get in ahead of the game. So, of course, Griffin supported Rosie O Donnell when she tweeted a video asking if Barron Trump, 10-year-old son of Donald and Melania, was on the autism spectrum.  After the beat down he gave her, she can say whatever she wants to say to that piece of shit,  Griffin said before correcting herself.  Oh, that s President Piece of Shit.

 The GOP Is Quietly Working On A New And VILE Way To Sh*t On American Consumers,"Doesn t Corporate America get enough breaks at the expense of the everyday American? Apparently not, because they re working on a bill that would limit the ability of the American consumer to sue, even in cases of gross negligence and flat-out illegal acts. Already it s difficult to sue due to all the legal fine print that corporations use specifically to make it harder to sue. And now Republicans want to expand and cement corporations immunity from responsibility.Of course, they gave it a name intended to deceive us into believing they re making things more fair for everyone. Leveling the playing field. Things like that. It s called the  Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017.  It s anything but fair   it tips the balance of lawsuits so far towards corporations that it s obscene.Class action lawsuits  are often the only avenue for Americans to hold corporations accountable if they are victims of widespread illegal behavior.  In other words, victims of fraud and scams, unsafe products and workplaces, and of human and civil rights violations, would have little to no recourse, according to a detailed analysis from Elizabeth Burch from the University of Georgia s School of Law.Other egregious behavior companies could get away with include price fixing, gender discrimination, securities fraud could go unchecked, deceptive or even false advertising could likewise go unchecked, and so much more.Sure, there are laws in place that prohibit all of that, but holding companies truly responsible for the harm that their lawlessness causes involves hurting their bottom line. Do Republicans plan to put inspectors in every corporation there is, just to ensure that they all follow the law? Class-action suits really are our only method of holding a corporation s feet to the fire when they break the law.Should this bill pass, it s anything but  America first,  and as such, it s a major kick in the face to regular consumers. Republicans are disgusting.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"March 7, 2017"
 Bernie Sanders Reveals His Full Health Care Funding Plan: The 1% Are Going To Hate It,"Just hours before the final Democratic primary debate, Bernie Sanders has finally released his full healthcare plan.On his campaign site, Sanders lays out how important the Affordable Care Act has been. He notes that he, himself, helped contribute to the huge piece of legislation that helped to provide 17 million people with health insurance.But Sanders believes that it is time to move forward with a national healthcare system that provides coverage to all. He writes on his site: All Americans can benefit from increased protections against lifetime coverage limits and exclusion from coverage because of pre-existing conditions, Sanders says. But as we move forward, we must build upon the success of the ACA to achieve the goal of universal health care. Twenty-nine million Americans today still do not have health insurance and millions more are underinsured and cannot afford the high copayments and deductibles charged by private health insurance companies that put profits before people. There has been some controversy between Democrats this week relating to the issue of Sanders  proposal to implement a universal healthcare system in the United States. Concerns over how this program would be funded have been of particular interest to the public. Sanders lays that out in plain detail for all to read.Most of the health care plan receives its funding from new progressive taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Some people in the middle class might pay a tiny bit more in taxes. According to the campaign website,  A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.  That small increase in taxes isn t anything to what a similar family would save under Sanders  plan. They would save around $5,000 dollars a year. Last year, the average working family paid $4,955 in premiums and $1,318 in deductibles to private health insurance companies. Under this plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the single-payer program, amounting to a savings of over $5,800 for that family each year,  the site reads.It long past time that the United States join every other industrialized nation in the world and implement a national single-payer healthcare system. That s what the ACA was presented as a stepping stone towards. Regardless of who is the eventual Democratic nominee, the fight for healthcare as a right need to be at the top of the Democratic platform. Democrats should not have to apologize for wanting to live in a nation where every person can get the healthcare they need.Should a better proposal than Sanders  be presented, it should be adopted. There may be some strategic advantages to wanted to expand the ACA very gradually, but we are talking about people s lives. But there are some big cracks in the ACA. Cracks that 29 million people have fallen through. It is time that we come together and demand that, no person deserves to be left behind.You can read a full break down of the plan here.Featured Image Credit: Phil Roeder via Flickr ",News,"January 17, 2016"
 Stephen King Tweets ULTIMATE Sean Spicer Insult That Is Pretty Goddamn Funny (TWEET),"Just when you thought you ve heard the ultimate insult being hurled at Sean Spicer for being Donald Trump s fall guy and practically the dumbest person on the planet, legendary author Stephen King steps up and knocks one out of the park.As you ve likely heard by now, unless you live in a cave or something, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer pretty much denied the existence of the Holocaust by making the ridiculous statement that Syrian President Assad is worse than Adolf Hitler, because at least Hitler didn t gas people. And as you probably well know, and if you don t, shame on you, Jewish concentration camps under Hitler s Nazi regime murdered millions of Jews in gas chambers.Witnessing this stupidity alongside the rest of America and the world was Stephen King who then went after Spicer, as one should, for being so remarkably dumb.King tweeted out: If donuts were awarded for dumb, Sean Spicer would have his own Krispy Kreme franchise.

JESSE JACKSON STYLE SHAKEDOWN: NAACP President Caught Selling Endorsements For Political Candidates,"Making a political endorsement by the NAACP completely irrelevant You d think in order to get an endorsement from the NAACP or its members that you d have to demonstrate loyalty and allegiance to black causes, but you d be wrong. All it takes is some cold hard cash. An NAACP chapter president is offering up political endorsements from a Political Action Committee he represents in exchange for a fat stack of Ben Franklins.Hezekiah Jackson is the Birmingham, AL NAACP chapter president. He is also the co-chair of Team Seven, a powerful local PAC whose endorsements promise to deliver votes from the black community. Team Seven is hosting a banquet on February 4 for local candidates to connect with voters. Of course this banquet is not free to the candidates, but there s something even dirtier about it.I know that I wrote in my headline that Jackson was busted for selling endorsements, which implies he was sneaking around and got caught. In actuality, he was flaunting this pay-off scheme and didn t care who noticed. According to AL.com, Jackson sent the following e-mail to candidates he hoped would slide a little money his way. It s basically a list of how much things cost and what you get for it:1. Deadline to submit payment is Friday, January 23, 2016 to me (Jackson) or Pastor Webb (Ad committee co-chair Gwen Webb).2. Candidates purchasing an ad ($500) will have two minutes to speak.3. Candidates purchasing a table ($500) will have two minutes to speak.4. Candidates purchasing a combo (ad   $250 and table for eight   $500 = $750) will have three minutes to speak.Pay close attention to the next one:5. Candidates who do not purchase an ad nor a table WILL NOT be considered for endorsement.Did you get that? The candidates either pay up or they won t even be considered for an endorsement from Jackson s PAC. No matter how you look at it, that s unethical as hell and probably illegal. Political Action Committees are bound by certain laws and I d like to believe shaking down politicians for endorsements is a big no-no.This is a classic Al Sharpton race-hustling scheme. You want an endorsement? You want to be absolved of offending the black community? You want to avoid bad press and a boycott? Just pay some tribute to the good Reverend and he ll handle everything. Some may see this as extortion, but to Sharpton it s just black activism. Via: DownTrend",politics,"Jan 24, 2016"

BREAKING: NORTHWESTERN FOOTBALL PLAYERS SHOT DOWN IN BID TO TOTALLY RUIN COLLEGE FOOTBALL,"And the AFL-CIO is crying in their money pit wouldn t it be a great get to have college football players unionized? The players are students and not employees unless you want to bust this whole thing wide open and tell the truth about how players might be compensated. It s really pretty shocking that the NLRB decided to shoot this down since they re 3-2 Dem. The National Labor Relations Board rejected a bid by football players at Northwestern University to form a union. In an unanimous decision released Monday, the board said it lacked jurisdiction in the matter. By statute the board does not have jurisdiction over state-run colleges and universities,  it said. The board is the main federal labor law enforcement agency. Its members are nominated by the president and it currently has a 3-2 Democratic majority.The announcement reverses a March 2014 decision by a board regional director, who ruled that the players were employees of the university, not students. Therefore, they had the right to form a union.While that ruling applied only to Northwestern athletes, it had major implications for college athletics generally, being the first time a student-athlete group has been granted collective bargaining rights. Other groups could have cited it as a precedent if they tried to unionize.Via: Washington Examiner",Government News,"Aug 17, 2015"
 The Revolution Won’t Be Beat: Here’s How Sanders Is Going To Change The Democratic Party (VIDEO),"While Bernie Sanders is nowhere near ready to concede defeat in the Democratic primary race, on Thursday the Vermont Senator vowed to bring  the most progressive agenda that any party has ever seen  to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.According to Fortune, Sanders and his backers have not yet decided on all of the issues they will press for during the convention, which is scheduled to take place at the end of July.But on Monday Senator Sanders listed single-payer healthcare and a comprehensive climate change plan as issues the Democratic party would need to adopt if they hoped to gain support from his backers.Later in the week, during an interview with CNN, Jane Sanders pointed to election reform as another of the campaign s top issues.Mrs. Sanders said during the interview: One of the things that we will be fighting for on the platform, whether he s the candidate or not, is electoral reform. The process needs to change. We need an open electoral system, same-day registration and open primaries. According to Fortune, Sanders  team may also press the party to change primary rules, and to eliminate the use of superdelegates to determine the party s nominee, a system which many Democratic voters are uncomfortable with.Another item likely to be on Sanders  agenda is a $15 federal minimum wage.With 14 primaries yet to be held, Sanders  told a crowd of supporters at Purdue University on Wednesday that he s  in this campaign to win and become the Democratic nominee. Watch a video clip from the candidate s speech, via YouTube, below:While many pundits and pollsters say that Senator Sanders has little chance of winning the party s nomination, as Fortune reports here, win or lose, if Sanders captures at least 40 percent of pledged delegates during the primary, party rules provide a lot of room for his supporters to define the party s platform.It would not be the first time in history that such a maneuver has taken place.As Fortune reports:In the divisive 1980 Democratic convention, losing candidate and then-Senator Ted Kennedy battled with President Jimmy Carter over major platform points, bringing amendments to the convention floor in a show of defiance.

 BUSTED: Trump Supporter Used Poll Watcher Credentials To Force Early Voters To Leave Polling Place,"Clearly, there is no low Trump supporters won t stoop in the effort to get him elected president.Ever since the Republican nominee told his deplorable supporters that the election is  rigged  and that they should become poll watchers there has been multiple incidents of voter intimidation, voter suppression, and voter fraud by Trump supporters and even an act of violence against a polling place.And another Trump supporter just got caught trying to intimidate early voters into leaving an Arkansas polling place.Thus far, early voting has benefited Hillary Clinton and that s a big deal with only four days left until Election Day. So Jefferson County Election Commission Stu Soffer, who is a Trump supporter, used his poll watcher credentials and stood in a doorway to yell at early voters at the Pine Bluff polling location to leave. Shut up and go home,  Soffer yelled while blocking the entrance to the voting booths according to Jefferson County Clerk Patricia Johnson and a voter named Victor who did not get to cast his ballot because of Soffer s interference. As a result of the disruption and confusion caused by Stu Soffer and other Republicans   I was not able to cast my ballot that day,  Victor said.According to attorney Chris Burke, who represents Victor in the lawsuit filed against Soffer,  Mr. Soffer stood in the doorway of the early-voting location and told voters to shut up and go home. As a result, Victor and many other voters were unable to cast their votes that day. This is deeply troubling to the voters of Jefferson County and also to the election administrators whose job it is to administer the elections free of fear and intimidation,  Burke added.This is just the latest incident of a Trump supporter trying to rig the election for Donald Trump.In Green Bay, Wisconsin a city clerk tried to deny a request for an extra polling place near the local university solely on the grounds that she believes college students are more likely to vote for Democrats.In Iowa, a Trump supporter literally got caught trying to vote twice and was arrested.And a right-wing group is creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on Election Day for Trump.These incidents, including this recent one in Arkansas prove that Trump supporters are trying to rig the election for their candidate and it s only going to get worse in the days ahead, especially on Election Day as conservatives desperately try to secure a victory for the Republican nominee by hook or by crook.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"November 4, 2016"
 This Conservative Wants To Let Scalia Vote From The Grave On SCOTUS Cases (VIDEO),"In an obvious scheme to keep the Supreme Court slanted their way, a conservative lawyer in Arizona claims that Scalia can and should be allowed to vote from beyond the grave.When Justice Antonin Scalia died just over a week ago, he left behind some major cases that could have been ruled 5-4 in favor of conservatives, including an anti-abortion case, an Affordable Healthcare Act contraception case, a case involving public sector unions, a case on voting rights, and a case on affirmative action just to name a few.Conservatives were foaming at the mouth in anticipation of winning most, if not all, of these cases. So it s understandable that they were disappointed when Scalia passed away before decisions could be made on these cases.But one conservative attorney in Arizona is throwing a desperation Hail Mary in an effort to make sure conservatives continue to control the Supreme Court 5-4 even though the composition of the high court is now 4-4.During a KPNX panel on the status of the Court, Kory Langhofer claimed that Justice Scalia should be allowed to cast a vote even though he is dead. There s no Ouija board required to figure out how Justice Scalia would vote on these things, he s already voted,  Langhofer claimed on Sunday. He explained that all of the Justices meet and discuss the case before one Justice goes off to write the decision. And that is why Langhofer thinks Scalia can still vote on these cases.  We re at the second-to-last step in how these cases unfold when Justice Scalia died,  he said.  We know exactly what he thought. And it s not unprincipled to say we should give affect to that. Langhofer then used an example of a US Senator dying after the Senate sends a freshly passed bill to the President after the Vice-President casts the tie-breaking vote.The problem with comparing Congress to the Supreme Court is that the senator had already cast their final vote on the bill, whereas Justice Scalia might have changed his mind anytime between discussion and writing an opinion. And that s how attorney Thomas Ryan explained it to Langhofer. Justices, after they do the conferences can also change their minds,  he pointed out.  The general rule is dead justices don t vote. I mean, that sounds cruel, but that s it. Here s the video via YouTube:But Langhofer continued to argue that Justice Scalia s conservative ideology should be used to decide cases with his opinion even after his death.Of course, if that s the case, why not continue to use long-dead Chief Justice Roger B. Taney s notes to let him vote on cases today? I m sure the author of the Dred Scott decision in 1857 would love to be able to cast votes in cases involving civil rights. After all, we know how he would vote on these things. Or how about we let former Justice Harry Blackmun, who died in 1999, vote on any upcoming abortion cases? After all, we know how he would vote on these things considering he authored the Roe v. Wade decision.112 Americans have sat on the Court. 11 of them still live, but only 8 are still active Justices. So it would be a pain in the ass to access how each of the 101 dead Justices would vote on a Supreme Court case in the present day. Only a living Justice can make a decision, and none of the cases Scalia was discussing reached a final decision because no decision is final until it is announced. Justices can and have changed their minds before at the last minute and there is no way of knowing what Scalia would have done had he still been alive, even with notes kept by the Chief Justice. And that s why dead Justices do not get a vote on the Supreme Court.This is nothing more than a ploy that conservatives are toying with to keep Scalia on the high court for the next year while Republicans block President Obama from nominating a living person to fill the empty seat. It s a dangerous slope that threatens our Constitution, which, by the way, says nothing about letting a dead judge continue to issue rulings until a new judge replaces them.The bottom line is that Scalia is dead, and while that is tragic for his friends and family, the Supreme Court must move on and that means a new Justice must takeover whether conservatives like it or not.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"February 21, 2016"

"WHOA! Is RINO Senator Mitch McConnell Behind Roy Moore “Hit Job”?…”I strongly, strongly suspect somebody out of the McConnell camp planted the story”","From the Washington Examiner   Roy Moore is the embattled Republican senatorial nominee in Alabama, but two other figures in the party have even more to lose in his race: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.First, the obvious. If Moore is beaten by Democrat Doug Jones   a leaked National Republican Senatorial Committee poll has the socially conservative retired judge trailing Jones by 12 points, but this is at odds with public polling   McConnell will be knocked down to leading a 51-49 Republican Senate.That may not seem like much in a Senate that has no meaningful filibuster for executive and judicial appointments, but where 52 votes are no more useful for advancing legislation that can t be snuck through the reconciliation process. It is nevertheless significant given that the Senate has already had trouble passing major legislation like Obamacare repeal and tax reform with the majority it currently has.It also would bring the Democrats one vote closer to recapturing the Senate majority, despite a very daunting electoral map for the upper chamber in 2018. Winning such a reliably red state would aid Democratic candidate recruitment across the board and embolden the party s ten senators from states President Trump carried who are up for re-election next year.Superficially speaking, McConnell comes out a loser if Moore is defeated. But not in the bigger picture. The Dec. 12 special Senate election in Alabama could also be viewed as a front in the proxy war between McConnell and Bannon.After leaving the White House, Bannon threatened to recruit primary challengers for most of the incumbent Republican senators who are seeking re-election in 2018. At a joint press conference with Trump in the Rose Garden, McConnell didn t mince words about how he felt about this gambit. Look, you know, the goal here is to win elections in November,  McConnell said last month.  Back in 2010 and 2012, we nominated several candidates   Christine O Donnell, Sharron Angle, Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock. They re not in the Senate. And the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election. My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority,  he added.  The way you do that is not complicated. You have to have nominated people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home. Bannon wants more Republican senators who will vote against McConnell. McConnell and his allies believe the Breitbart News chief s intervention in the primaries could lead to fewer Republican senators overall, so they have started punching back.In September s Alabama Republican primary, McConnell went all in on appointed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange and lost, despite the president s backing. Bannon made the argument that the candidate Trump endorsed wasn t the one who would be most supportive of the Trump agenda. For that, he insisted, you needed an anti-establishment candidate like Moore. Bannon, via Moore, won.Both men might have been better off with Rep. Mo Brooks, who was eliminated in the first round of voting. Brooks was big on the Trump agenda and did not have all the weird sexual baggage that could wind up dooming Moore. Bannon allies told the Washington Examiner that the former top Trump strategist might have preferred Brooks.Yet McConnell s political apparatus spent heavily against Moore to protect Strange, a sitting senator who struggled from the local perception he secured his seat through some kind of corrupt bargain with disgraced former Gov. Robert Bentley. And Bannon couldn t very well throw his weight behind a candidate who, despite being ideologically Trumpist, endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, over Trump in the 2016 primaries   especially while still serving in the West Wing.Freed from the White House, Bannon backed Moore less because the  Ten Commandments judge  had any particular affinity for the issues that Trump ran on last year and more because Alabama s political conditions made him likely to beat Strange. Moore would owe McConnell and the establishment nothing, but Bannon would have chits to cash in and an improved reputation as a kingmaker inside the GOP.If Moore loses in a disastrous fashion (and remember it is courting disaster for this race to even be competitive; in 2014, Jeff Sessions had no Democratic challenger and won over 97 percent of the vote), it will prove McConnell s point about the futility of Bannon s enterprise before the Senate majority is ever really at risk.Breitbart   American Majority founder Ned Ryun talked about Roy Moore and the Alabama Senate race with Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon and SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday s Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live from the Restoration Weekend event.Bannon asked Ryun about celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred s involvement in the Roy Moore case, representing a woman who accuses Moore of assaulting her in 1977 when she was 16 years old.Ryan said Allred is  basically a human vulture when you look back at some of the things she s been involved in.Watch lawyer Gloria Allred, as she skirts the issue of whether or not the high school yearbook being used to prove a relationship between Judge Roy Moore and one of his accusers is a forgery:Watch forgery expert make case that Gloria Allred s client is lying about Roy Moore s signature: Remember the incident with Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Ryun asked.  She brought all these women in front of him, said they re going to sue, they re going to file suit against Schwarzenegger. Guess what? After the election, absolutely nothing happened. I think a real turning point was that press conference when they pulled out the yearbook and the signature,  he said of Allred s entry into the Moore controversy, referring to an interview with MSNBC s Katy Tur where Allred did not come off well.Ryun said this interview demonstrated that the best way to respond to sensational allegations is to  just throw facts back at them. Ryun said there was no doubt in his mind that the allegations against Moore were part of an  organized hit,  as Bannon put it. I ve been in D.C. almost 20 years. And, again, I don t have hard proof, and I will say this clearly: I do not have hard proof, but I strongly suspect it s a very short list of people, all who are associated with Mitch McConnell   whether it s Josh Holmes, whether it s Karl Rove, might even be Steven Law   I don t know, but I strongly, strongly suspect somebody out of the McConnell camp planted the story. It was planted. This came with the blessing of Mitch McConnell at some point, that he was going to take a political shot at Roy Moore,  he declared. ",politics,"Nov 18, 2017"
WATCH HILLARY SQUIRM When Mainstream Media Asks If She Plans To Watch “13 Hours” Movie,"Hillary was too busy to be bothered with making Benghazi a safer place for Ambassador Stevens, so it should really come as no surprise that she s too busy to watch  13 HOURS,  the true story of Benghazi. By the way, whoever told Hillary that calling the families of the four men killed in Benghazi  liars,  just as the true story of what really happened under her watch is coming out in theaters nationwide, should be fired One of the enduring mysteries of the Benghazi tragedy is why anyone ever took seriously Hillary Clinton s blaming some obscure maker of a YouTube video for the attack. That mystery, however, is dwarfed by the way the media try to pretend that Hillary s denials of that happening are anything other than bald-faced (that bald-face would be pasty white, wrinkled, and bewhiskered). In testimony elicited by the Benghazi Committee and in released emails, it has become apparent that no one ever thought the video was to blame and Clinton has, herself, attempted to claim that she never blamed the video.Now there is a new  wrinkle  to the story. Hillary told the families that the video was the cause of the attack that led to the deaths of their family members. Now she is saying they are lying.First, there is her statement when she, shamelessly, stood in the hangar at Dover AFB as the bodies of the dead men returned home:CLINTON: Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with.Then we have the families themselves:Transcript via TownhallTyrone Woods  father (who took notes about their meeting):  I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the film maker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son She said   the filmmaker who was responsible for the death of your son Sean Smith s mother:  She s absolutely lying. She told me something entirely different at the casket ceremony. She said it was because of the video. Sean Smith s uncle:  Mrs. Clinton really has a problem embracing the truth. Glen Doherty s sister:  When I think back now to that day and what she knew, it shows me a lot about her character that she would choose in that moment to basically perpetuate what she knew was untrue. On ABC s This Week, Clinton family retainer, George Stephanopoulos, revisited the issue   I have no idea why other than some misbegotten effort to  set the record straight    and got this response:https://youtu.be/jAUDS-aLGjISTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was about the film? And what s your response?CLINTON: No. You know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now, I can t   I can t help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group, uh, that had taken responsibility on Facebook, um, between the time that, uh, I   you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information; we were, uh, giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn t true. In fact, they retracted it. This was a fast-moving series of events in the fog of war and I think most Americans understand that.So we have Hillary blaming the video at the arrival of the caskets. We have all four families agreeing that they were told it was a video. We have Hillary on record blaming the video in the week after the attack. And now she says it never happened.This woman is a pathological liar. The sad thing is that she could probably pass a lie detector test. Via: Red State ",Government News,"Jan 17, 2016"

 Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him After Whining About Russia Investigation Like A Frightened Schoolboy,"Donald Trump is definitely protesting too much.This would be a good time for Trump to keep his mouth shut, but as usual, he s not.When top law firms refused to work for him on this case, they did so for precisely this reason. Having a client who constantly sets fires with his mouth is not a client any lawyer wants to put up with. They would prefer Trump exercise his right to remain silent. After all, we have that right for a reason.But Trump has been obsessed with whining about the Russia investigation and the obstruction of justice investigation led by special investigator Robert Mueller. Trump was recently talked out of firing him by his aides. So he has resorted to attacks on social media.On Friday morning, Trump resumed complaining.After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my  collusion with the Russians,  nobody has been able to show any proof.

Even Trump himself asked Russian hackers to go after Hillary Clinton s emails. Furthermore, the economic and jobs numbers are only great because Trump is still benefiting from the economic policies of President Obama. Once his policies fully kick in, those will take a nosedive.Trump should also be informed that a lot of his followers on Twitter are bots and people who loathe him.

 Rachel Maddow Reveals Her Secret To Successfully Covering Trump,"The Rachel Maddow Show has become a hit among cable news viewers, with more than double the number of people tuning in. Maddow herself recently revealed her secret to successfully covering Donald Trump: treat him like a silent movie. We developed sort of an informal, internal mantra  which is that we basically cover them as if they are a silent movie,  Maddow explained. I stopped covering the Twitter feed and we started covering only what they do rather than what they say. Without a doubt, she s doing something right. The Wrap reports that in February, Maddow had the  largest total viewer audience ever in the 9 p.m. ET timeslot.  But her success isn t limited to just one month. She has also  beaten CNN s regularly scheduled programming for 45 straight months,  and  gained 99 percent in total viewers compared to February 2016.  During the same time period, CNN gained only 70 percent and Fox News increased by a measly 31 percent. It is an unusual thing that the White House and its chief spokespeople have been called out saying stuff that s not true over and over and over again,  she said.  It s the petty stuff but it s also important stuff that they ve not told the truth about. Maddow explains that lies have consequences. Once you prove yourself as untrustworthy, you words no longer have any real meaning.  We no longer go to that person for factual information,  Maddow said. Once she realized that these people could no longer be trusted, she came up with a new game plan for covering the Trump administration. I really feel like it was helpful to me, in terms of trying to come up with what to talk about every day, and serving up information for our audience that is substantive and not manipulated by people at the White House,  Maddow said.  It was helpful for us to just stop paying attention to what they were saying. Maddow said that Kellyanne Conway might be a nice person,  but as her fellow MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski recently pointed out, she s just not credible anymore.  Maddow added that conversations with her (and most of Trump s other surrogates) are  essentially just talking to a pro-Trump political operative  rather than actually speaking to a White House representative.It seems that Maddow has done what the majority of the media is still struggling to do. She has figured out how to cover Trump and the secret is simple: focus only on what they do, not what they say because it s probably a lie anyway.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 3, 2017"
STUDENTS SENT HOME From School For Wearing Traditional Swiss Clothing Considered “racist”,"You certainly don t want to get caught showing pride for your nation  Kinda reminds us of the kids who got sent home from school for wearing an American flag on their shirts because they offended the Mexican immigrant students Ten pupils at a secondary school in Gossau turned up for their lessons wearing an edelweiss shirt on Friday.A teacher was very unhappy at the sight of this typically Swiss clothing; he asked them to go and put something else on.According to the  SonntagsZeitung , the teacher considered that this manner of dress conveyed  racist and xenophobic  ideas. The ten pupils decided to come to school wearing peasant shirts and to sing patriotic songs to show their  pride in being Swiss .Tensions with classmates of Balkan origin are said to be at the origin of this initiative, reports the German-speaking weekly. The school s headmaster is trying to calm things down. Patrick Perenzin points out that peasant shirts do not violate any institutional dress code and that they are not forbidden. But he adds that, in his view, the ten pupils behaved badly. When worn by one pupil, this clothing is not insulting. But when ten pupils decide to wear it at the same time, they are trying to  send a message , says the headmaster. Via: 20min.com",politics,"Jan 10, 2016"

At least four people at a Bernie Sanders rally in Oakland rushed the stage Monday evening, spurring Secret Service agents to jump onto the raised platform and protect him.The Democratic presidential candidate was uninjured and continued speaking, but not before several agents hugged him and pushed him away from the microphone. The identities of the individuals, who yelled as they approached the stage, were not immediately known. They were apprehended and led away by Secret Service from the podium at the Frank Ogawa Plaza, where the rally was being held. After the events of Monday night in Northern California, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said,  It was handled professionally by the Secret Service.

It s not that we can compare religious persecution to a cleansing of history but it does have some similarities.Emotions are running high because this involves a time in our history that brother fought brother and died Should we forget the struggle and refuse to honor those who fought and died? Isn t it true that we should always remember history and learn from it?We should also honor the soldiers who fought and died No matter what!A LETTER FROM A PATRIOT WHO MAKES THE CASE FOR KEEPING THE MONUMENTS:By William McMichaelAny Longhorn will proudly declare that The University of Texas is more than an academic institution. The University is a beacon   a promise that Texas will continue to produce citizens who care about its future. However, the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue from the Main Mall demonstrates that the university values its current students more than it does its future ones.I believe that society does well to relegate the memory of the Confederacy to museums. Its legacy haunts the United States in ways that many will never understand. Recent events demonstrate that our nation may never fully heal from the wounds that the Civil War inflicted. However, removing a statue does not equate to progress particularly when other symbols of Confederacy continue to stand on the South Mall.In fact, the crowd of students and professors that gathered to witness the statute s removal serves as clear evidence that the University worries more about public appearances than it does encouraging future generations to remember the achievements of the past. Much like the university, the Main Mall serves as more than a beautiful area of the campus. The university commissioned the mall as a memorial to the reconciliation of the North and South. Less than 50 years after the end of the Civil War, sons of Union and Confederate soldiers fought together on the fields of France during World War I. Their parents had taught them to hate each other, yet they persevered together to defeat a common enemy.The South Mall s designers arranged the statues in such a way that the sun set on the faces of the Confederacy, a sign that the era of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Albert Sidney Johnston would no longer govern Texas. However, the sun rises on the faces of men who stood as symbols of Texas  hope for a progressive future: President Woodrow Wilson, Gov. Jim Hogg, and Senator John Reagan   a former Confederate sympathizer who encouraged Texas to rejoin the Union.The statues look center toward a statute of George Washington, the preeminent founder who warned of the dangers of national division. The Littlefield Fountain bears a Latin inscription that translates to read:  Short is the life given, but the memory of a life nobly surrendered is everything. Ultimately, the South Mall reminds viewers not to honor the errors of the past, but rather that Texas can triumph in spite of its past. Yet rather than explain the Main Mall s history and purpose to the public, the University allowed errant voices to rule the day. As a result, future generations will likely forget the Main Mall s importance altogether. The moral of the story will be no more.Longhorns, do not continue wasting time by fretting over appearances. Fight for worthwhile causes, and remember your history. It will make you better, and thereby prompt you to change the world.McMichael lives in Waco.

A MUST READ! JUDGE NAPOLITANO: HILLARY’S SECRET WAR," Mrs. Clinton provided material assistance to terrorists and lied to Congress in a venue where the law required her to be truthful.    JUDGE NAPOLITANOIn the course of my work, I am often asked by colleagues to review and explain documents and statutes. Recently, in conjunction with my colleagues Catherine Herridge and Pamela Browne, I read the transcripts of an interview Ms. Browne did with a man named Marc Turi, and Ms. Herridge asked me to review emails to and from State Department and congressional officials during the years when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of state.What I saw has persuaded me beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that Mrs. Clinton provided material assistance to terrorists and lied to Congress in a venue where the law required her to be truthful. Here is the backstory.Mr. Turi is a lawfully licensed American arms dealer. In 2011, he applied to the Departments of State and Treasury for approvals to sell arms to the government of Qatar. Qatar is a small Middle Eastern country whose government is so entwined with the U.S. government that it almost always will do what American government officials ask of it.In its efforts to keep arms from countries and groups that might harm Americans and American interests, Congress has authorized the Departments of State and Treasury to be arms gatekeepers. They can declare a country or group to be a terrorist organization, in which case selling or facilitating the sale of arms to it is a felony. They also can license dealers to sell.Mr. Turi sold hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of arms to the government of Qatar, which then, at the request of American government officials, were sold, bartered or given to rebel groups in Libya and Syria. Some of the groups that received the arms were on the U.S. terror list. Thus, the same State and Treasury Departments that licensed the sales also prohibited them.How could that be?That s where Mrs. Clinton s secret State Department and her secret war come in. Because Mrs. Clinton used her husband s computer server for all of her email traffic while she was the secretary of state, a violation of three federal laws, few in the State Department outside her inner circle knew what she was up to.Now we know.She obtained permission from President Obama and consent from congressional leaders in both houses of Congress and in both parties to arm rebels in Syria and Libya in an effort to overthrow the governments of those countries.Many of the rebels Mrs. Clinton armed, using the weapons lawfully sold to Qatar by Mr. Turi and others, were terrorist groups who are our sworn enemies. There was no congressional declaration of war, no congressional vote, no congressional knowledge beyond fewer than a dozen members, and no federal statute that authorized this.When Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, asked Mrs. Clinton at a public hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Jan. 23, 2013, whether she knew about American arms shipped to the Middle East, to Turkey or to any other country, she denied any knowledge. It is unclear whether she was under oath at the time, but that is legally irrelevant. The obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to Congress pertains to all witnesses who testify before congressional committees, whether an oath has been administered or not. (Just ask Roger Clemens, who was twice prosecuted for misleading Congress about the contents of his urine while not under oath. He was acquitted.)Here is her relevant testimony:Mr. Paul: My question is is the U.S. involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons buying, selling anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?Mrs. Clinton: To Turkey?   I will have to take that question for the record. Nobody s ever raised that with me. I, I .Mr. Paul: It s been in news reports that ships have been leaving from Libya and that they may have weapons and what I d like to know is the [Benghazi] annex that was close by . Were they involved with procuring, buying, selling, obtaining weapons and were any of these weapons transferred to other countries any countries, Turkey included?Mrs. Clinton: Senator, you will have to direct that question to the agency that ran the annex. And I will see what information is available and ahhhh .Mr. Paul: You are saying you don t know .Mrs. Clinton: I do not know. I don t have any information on that. VIDEO OF THIS TESTIMONY IS BELOW: This secret war and the criminal behavior that animated it was the product of conspirators in the White House, the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the CIA and a tight-knit group of members of Congress. Their conspiracy has now unraveled. Where is the outrage among the balance of Congress?Read more: WT",politics,"Jul 2, 2015"
 WATCH: Donald Trump Literally Offers To ‘Destroy’ A State Senator’s Career,"After a Texas sheriff whined about a piece of legislation, Donald Trump seriously offered to  destroy  the lawmaker who wrote it.Texas Republican Senator Bob Hall represents Rockwall County, and he plans to introduce a bill that prevents police from seizing assets unless there is a conviction first.Basically, the legislation allows suspects who are arrested to keep their property and finances intact until they are formally convicted of their alleged crimes by a court of law.It makes sense, but Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson complained to Trump at a meeting on Tuesday that Hall s bill isn t the kind of cooperation he has been demanding.

This is the kind of thing that tyrants do. And what s amazing is that this is a state lawmaker. Frankly, Trump should stay out of local and state affairs of this kind. Surely, the Texas Senate and House can decide if Hall s bill is worthy of passage. Furthermore, voters elected Hall to represent them. If they don t like what he is doing they will destroy him by not re-electing him. Trump isn t only threatening a lawmaker, he is threatening democracy. And he should not be allowed to get away with it.Read more:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"February 7, 2017"

 The Trump Campaign Paid Don Jr’s Lawyer A Vast Amount Of Money Just Before Scandal Broke (IMAGES),"Donald Trump s allies would very much like the RNC to cover the legal costs of retaining attorneys amid the inquiries into whether the campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. It appears, though, that the alleged president s reelection campaign has already paid a legal firm $50,000 and that was just two weeks before Donald Trump Jr. s email scandal broke.Trump s reelection campaign (that s kind of funny considering that it s hard to determine if the former reality show star will last even a year in office at this point) paid $50,000 to the law offices of Alan Futerfas on June 26, according to a new filing with the Federal Election Commission.The Daily Beast reports:On July 11, the New York Times revealed the contents of a June 2016 email exchange in which Trump Jr., through an associate, solicited damaging information about 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton.Just a day earlier, he had enlisted the services of Futerfas, who is best known for representing four of New York s major Italian mob families. The announcement of the hire came not from the Trump campaign but from the president s company, where Trump Jr. remains a trustee.Perhaps this is why the amateur president holds so many rallies even though he just got into office. Donations pour in from his gullible supporters and now, his own fans are paying the legal fees   presumably for his son s scandal.Drip, drip, drip:The Trump campaign s FEC filing shows significant expenditures on legal representation as it wades through scrutiny involving alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. As part of that investigation, the FBI is examining whether the Trump campaign guided Russian disinformation efforts aimed at key voting precincts.The consulting firm owned by Brad Parscale, the former Trump campaign digital director at the center of that controversy, received more than $2 million in payments from the campaign in the second quarter.The name of the committee: Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.The Trump campaign began paying Don Jr's lawyer about two weeks before the email story broke, per new FEC filing pic.twitter.com/F0ifZ3q2Xw  Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) July 15, 2017The campaign is also paying the Trump Corp. for legal consulting, a new category of campaign-to-Trump company payments as best I can tell pic.twitter.com/J6Smlw6ItI  Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) July 15, 2017The filing also shows that the campaign settled on a new vendor for legal consulting services: the Trump Corporation. So, it appears that Trump is profiting from his own scandal. According to the filing, the campaign paid the company nearly $90,000 three days after its payment to Futerfas.Trump claims to know nothing about the meeting his son took with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. That meeting was set up to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Jared Kushner, Trump s son-in-law, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, attended the meeting at Trump Tower. 5 others attended, including Russians. Junior keeps changing his story but it s all coming out in the wash. We re sure Mr. Mueller is taking notes.And none of this looks suspicious at all (wink wink).Photo by John Moore/Getty Images",News,"July 15, 2017"

“REFUGEE DRESS” Sold Online Forced to Change Name After Social Media Goes Ballistic,"We d love to know your thoughts on this! We think it s sort of unreal that this company was forced via social media to drop the name and change it from  Refugee Dress  to  Oxford Dress Does anyone see the irony in this name change?We also want to weigh in on just how unattractive this dress is and how it just looks like a sheet. Your thoughts?A controversial  Refugee Dress  was still being sold Tuesday on the website of clothing retailer UZINYC, six days after the company said it had changed the name of the much criticized dress.WHAT S INTERESTING IS THAT THE NAME OF THIS DRESS HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 2007: We named the dress in 2007 when we could not see ourselves escaping the reality of a global economy spinning out of control The brand was forced to change the name of the $119 dress from  Refugee Dress  to  Oxford Dress,  after a storm of criticism on social media. But while the company had re-named the title of the page, it seemed to have forgotten about the picture captions, which still label the dress as a  black refugee dress.  That label can still be seen by scrolling down the homepage of the website and clicking a photo preview of the garment.TWITTER IS ABUZZ OVER THE DRESS:So this brand thought it was appropriate to sell a  refugee  dress? Disgusting. #uzinyc https://t.co/mxlMDQWG4p pic.twitter.com/2WSKojHFE5  Rianna Croxford (@The_Crox) July 31, 2017UZINYC recently told Mic that it originally created the dress to draw attention to the refugee crisis.  We feel that it is important to keep these issues within public discourse,  co-founder Mari Gustafson told the website.   The American economy has recovered, and through perseverance and luck our company has recovered as well. We are now able to provide jobs for others and give them a sense of hope and stability.   We are sorry if we have disturbed anyone,  Gustafson told Today.com.Last week, critics of the dress took to Twitter to complain about the use of the phrase  refugee  to market a dress.  Refugees are neither  nomads  nor sales gimmick,  one Twitter user wrote.  Apologize, rename dress, donate to UNHCR. Via: Fortune ",left-news,"Aug 9, 2017"
"FORMER COP Who Worked With Muslim Terrorist Complained About Homophobic, Racist Comments…Talked Of “Killing People”…Quit Job After MUSLIM Employer IGNORED Complaints","This is what happens when people are more concerned about hurting someone s feelings or profiling someone than reporting someone s behavior to the proper authorities. If the Muslim employer won t take action after a hateful and  unhinged  employee is talking about his desire to want to  kill  people, it s time to take it to the next level.A former Fort Pierce police officer who once worked with 29-year-old Omar Mateen, the assailant in an Orlando nightclub shooting that left at least 50 dead, said he was  unhinged and unstable. Daniel Gilroy said he worked the 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift with G4S Security at the south gate at PGA Village for several months in 2014-15. Mateen took over from him for a 3 to 11 p.m. shift.My Palm Beach Post   A licensed security guard who held a firearms license, Mateen started working for G4S in 2007, according to a company newsletter. While there, he had been a screener at an area courthouse, said Daniel Gilroy, a co-worker.Gilroy worked with Mateen after he transferred to a security guard detail at PGA Village in Port St Lucie.Mateen took his prayer mat to work and prayed regularly, but, Gilroy found Mateen s attitudes toward and comments to gays, African-Americans and women crude.And then there was the screaming. Mateen was constantly agitated and on the verge of an outburst, said Gilroy, who could hear his rants even outside of the guard house.Fed up, he told Mateen he wasn t interested in being friends.That s when he went  boiled-rabbit crazy,  said Gilroy, with Mateen texting him, pleading for a reconciliation of friendship, and accusing him of betrayal so frequently that Gilroy s girlfriend believed the two men might have been having an affair.Rather than continue, Gilroy quit his job.Mateen s former wife was also on the receiving end of his outbursts.Speaking to the press Sunday night, she described violent outbursts and beatings. My family literally had to rescue me,  she said.Greg Davis, a St. Lucie County man, said a friend who worked with Mateen  told me (Mateen s) demeanor recently had drastically changed. He was working out, he really bulked up. He showed up with a rental van the last night he was at work. That s strange because he loved his car,   said Davis.None of the erratic behavior showed up in the mosque, or was obvious to his neighbors. I would wave and say hello,  said Esmerelda Gonzalez, whose parents live next door to Mateen s former home onBayshore Boulevard.  We never talked beyond that. He came over and bought stuff at a yard sale we had. He came over once and asked if he could use our property for parking because he was having a family gathering. Visitors sometimes came to the house at odd hours, sometimes as early as 4 a.m., said Gonzalez, but she thought nothing of it.At the mosque, Rahman said he can t remember ever having a conversation with Mateen.Mateen, he said, attended  sporadically    frequently with his toddler son in tow   but his three sisters were regular faces, sometimes performing chores and cleaning the mosque.If Mateen leaned toward an extremist version of Islam, he kept it from his imam, who wept as he began Sunday evening prayers at the mosque. There is nothing outside the door that says you can t come in and worship God and be here and pray if you are gay,  Rahman said. And Rahman said he speaks out against terrorist groups at every gathering. They have hijacked our religion,  Rahman said.  They have caused more trouble for us than anything. Gilroy, a former Fort Pierce police officer, said Mateen frequently made homophobic and racial comments. Gilroy said he complained to his employer several times but it did nothing because he was Muslim. Gilroy quit after he said Mateen began stalking him via multiple text messages   20 or 30 a day. I quit because everything he said was toxic,  Gilroy said Sunday,  and the company wouldn t do anything. This guy was unhinged and unstable. He talked of killing people. Gilroy said this shooting didn t come as a surprise to him.Via: Florida Today",left-news,"Jun 13, 2016"
 Giuliani’s Excuse For Forgetting 9/11 Is Just As Bad As Forgetting It (VIDEO),"After a decade and a half of peppering nearly every political conversation with   as Joe Biden famously said   a noun, a verb and 9/11, the mayor who was in charge of New York City during 9/11 appeared to forget it ever happened when he said that terrorism didn t hit our country until President Obama took office.After taking a day of brutal media and Twitter mockery, Giuliani offered an explanation. He just didn t have enough time to form the couple of extra words, like  since 9/11. I m not there to give a major 45-minute policy address,  he said of his Trump introduction Monday in Youngstown, Ohio, where he said plainly that  under those eight years, before Obama came along, we didn t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States. You speak in somewhat abbreviated language,  Giuliani told The News Tuesday.  All human beings speak in abbreviated language at times. Source: New York Daily NewsEven this short video clip is a minute and 20 seconds long. He had plenty of time to talk about everything but 9/11.The idea that  all (terrorist attacks) started once Clinton and Obama came to office  is both false and offensive. The deadliest terrorist attack happened when Giuliani was in office, and many speculate that things would not have been so bad, especially for the first responders, under a different mayor.More than that, this is a dangerous lie. As of 2014, 3,158 people have died from terrorist attacks within the United States. Over 2,900 of those people died during the attacks of 9/11. Even with the addition of the San Bernardino shooting, far fewer than 100 people have died from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, at least since Obama took office.Whether or not Giuliani actually forgot 9/11 is irrelevant. Donald Trump is trying to create an environment in which no one is held accountable for their words, and Giuliani is no exception. The new way of campaigning, at least for Trump s team, is to spit out ridiculous accusations and assertions and then blame the media for directly quoting them. Giuliani says he will slip up again, as we all will, but since he s on the Trump team, don t look for any sort of contrition. Look for doubling down and more lies.Featured image via Jeff Swensen at Getty Images. ",News,"August 16, 2016"
"JACK-ASS-IN-CHIEF: OBAMA USES SPEECH ON WORLD STAGE To Apologize For Greedy Americans…Ties MLK, Jr. To Phony Climate Change [VIDEO]","For the umpteenth time, Obama takes the opportunity to trash Americans while overseas President Obama on Monday pushed world leaders to finalize a sweeping global agreement that would cut carbon emissions and hopefully stave off the worst effects of climate change.Invoking the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., Obama insisted that a grim future hurt by worsening global warming  is one that we have the power to change. Right here. Right now. But only if we rise to this moment,  he said in a speech kicking off the Paris conference. For all the challenges we face, the growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other,  Obama said.  What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet, is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realization that it is within our power to do something about it. I ve come here personally, as the leader of the world s largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it,  he added.

" Texas Republican Rejects Canadian Offer Of Real Help For Hurricane Victims, Asks For Prayers Instead","This is why religion should stay out of government.The people of Houston, Texas are drowning as flooding continues in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.Death and destruction are everywhere, and people are desperate for any help that can be provided. People need food, shelter, clothing, and medical supplies.At this point, the people of Houston don t really care where the aid comes from as long as it comes.But Texas  Republican Secretary of State rejected an offer from Canada this week that would have provided blankets, beds, and physical manpower to the region affected by the storm.Quebec s Minister of International Relations Christine St-Pierre contacted Rolando Pablos to offer aid and condolences. It was a conversation about how devastating the situation is and we want to express our support to the people of Texas,  St-Pierre said.Had Pablos accepted Canada s help, many people in Texas could have had blankets, pillows, and perhaps even something more crucial. The manpower Canada offered would have come in the form of professional electricians who would have helped restore much needed power to residents and buildings such as hospitals and shelters. Our crews are well-equipped and they have good knowledge of the grid so they can help to restore and rebuild the distribution lines,  Hydro-Qu bec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty told CBC. Indeed, 250 Hydro-Quebec electricians did great work restoring power in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Canada offered real help to storm victims. But Republicans slapped away their hand of friendship. Instead of accepting the generous offer of supplies and volunteers, Texas Republicans rejected the offer and asked for  prayers from the people of Quebec. That s right. Texas Republicans think prayers can help them more than actual supplies and manpower.What the people of Texas need right now are not prayers. They need blankets, beds, and electrical power, all of which are in short supply because God sent a f*cking hurricane to slam the Texas coast.The people of Texas should be outraged that their elected officials are not accepting help from Canada. This offer could mean the difference between life and death for many people. Prayer is not going to help. It s a nice thought, but it won t do any good. People can t get warm by wrapping themselves in prayer. Electrical lines won t magically fix themselves because of prayer.This is why Republicans are totally unfit to lead. They offer prayers instead of real solutions. And that is going to cause more deaths and suffering in Texas.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,"September 1, 2017"

She was recently suspended by FOX News when she said that [Barack]  Obama doesn t give a shit about terrorism. Today, on Fox and Friends, Stacey takes on Hollywood race hustler, and major Louis Farrakahn donor Jada Pinkett-Smith.Fox News contributor Stacey Dash asserted on Wednesday that Jada Pinkett Smith was a  hypocrite  for expecting some black actors to be nominated for an Oscar while the black community was enjoying special privileges like Black History Month and the BET channel.Watch Dash s appearance on Fox and Friends here:In a video posted to Facebook earlier this week, Smith revealed that she would not be attending the 88th Academy Awards to protest the fact all of the major nominees were white.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));We must stand in our power.Posted by Jada Pinkett Smith on Monday, January 18, 2016After recently being suspended from Fox News for saying President Barack Obama did not  give a sh*t,  she was back on the network on Wednesday to respond to Smith. I think it s ludicrous,  she opined.  Because we have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards, where you are only awarded if you are black. So you say there should not be a BET channel?  Fox News host Steve Doocy wondered. No, just like there shouldn t be a Black History Month,  Dash replied.  You know, we re Americans. Period. That s it. Are you saying there shouldn t be a Black History Month because there isn t a White History Month?  Doocy pressed. Exactly!  Dash insisted.According to Dash, the real problem was that Hollywood s support of President Barack Obama had not inspired filmmakers to create more black roles. We ve had a president who is black in office for the past eight years, who gets most of his funding from the liberal elite in Hollywood,  she said.  Yet, there are not very many roles for people of color. How can that be and why is it just now being addressed?  Via: RAW Story ",politics,"Jan 20, 2016"
DISGRACEFUL: US Air Force Can No Longer Afford 21-Gun Salute At Vet Funerals…Plenty Of Funds For Muslim Immigrants,"We can t afford to give our US Veterans a proper funeral, but we ve got money to burn when it comes to bringing Muslim refugees to the US from countries who hate us. On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household. When a veteran or member of the armed forces dies, he or she is entitled to a ceremony that includes the presentation of a U.S. flag to a family member and a bugler blowing Taps. Most of the time, there is a three-volley rifle salute if requested by family members. But now, if the deceased served in the Air Force, the three-volley salute is not an option because the Air Force can no longer support riflemen for funeral services for veteran retirees.Seven member services for retirees included six members to serve as pall-bearers, a six member flag-folding detail, and a three riflemen to fire the salute. Veteran s funerals now only receive the services of two-member teams, who provide a flag-folding ceremony, the playing of taps, and the presentation of the flag to the next of kin. To me, without the 21-gun salute, it just does not make it complete a proper military burial,  veteran Wayne Wakeman told Honolulu s KHON 2 News.  I think because of sequestration or the lack of funds or whatever excuse they re giving, that they had to hit the veterans. Wakeman is correct in supposing the cut is due to sequestration, the 2013 automatic federal spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.Rose Richeson, from the Secretary of the Air Force s Public Affairs Press Desk, told We Are The Mighty the policy of restricting the funeral honor is an Air Force-wide requirement. The requirement is consistent with DoD policy which require a minimum of two personnel,  Richeson said.  Any number of personnel above two that is provided in support of military funeral honors is based on local resources available.  Via: FOX News",left-news,"Jan 1, 2016"
 Trump Voter PANICKING After Realizing Border Wall Will Put Her House In Mexico (VIDEO),"D Ann Loop of Brownsville, Texas lost much of her land ten years ago when the Bush administration decided to put up a border fence that stretched across what used to be much of her property.Loop and her husband found themselves effectively locked out of the United States, as even their home ended up on the Mexico side of the fence. Their only access is a locked gate.The couple fought to keep their land   and lost   in court, placing all of their property on the southern side of the fence   and their nightmare is about to become very real for potentially thousands of people.You see, recently Texans along the border learned that The Donald was forcing them out of their homes for much less than they are worth. If they choose to stay in their homes, some of them have discovered they will soon be living among the criminal hordes down south. I was very angry, I just kept saying, how can they do that? How is that possible in the United States that they can do this?  Loop says.  They put up a fence in front of our land and then keep us in here   lock us in. I didn t understand. I was very   I was floored and flabbergasted. You hear that, folks? Floored and flabbergasted. It left us no property on the U.S. side of the border wall, including my house,  she says.  Everything was behind   on the Mexican side of the U.S. border fence. You punch your code in or you come behind the border wall, there is a feeling of isolation,  her husband, Ray Loop, added.Thousands of land owners   Trump voters and otherwise   along the Texas border will soon find themselves suffering buyer s remorse for the snake oil they purchased from our huckster-in-chief.Trump voter Pat Bell was fine with The Donald until she learned that his stupid wall placed her in danger of living like the Loops.

Absolutely I would go to the people who are in charge and, you hate to say I would get a lawyer, but if it comes to that issue, you would,  she says.Trump voters are perfectly fine with banning an entire religion from entering the country and building a wall to keep all those dirty brown rapists to the south from entering the country   even gutting social programs   but the second Trump s terrible policies begin to affect them, they will cry about how unfair their lives are.Watch a report on the Loops  predicament below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 4, 2017"

OBAMA AND DOJ’S RADICAL DIRECTOR To Meet Monday On Gun Control Executive Action,"When Loretta Lynch was confirmed as the new Director of the DOJ, it was clear that our Senate had once again caved to the radical agenda of the Obama administration. Lynch is nothing more than Eric Holder in a dress. So now we have a power grab on gun control that could have been predicted because Lord knows Obama needs to fulfill his agenda on everything before leaving office. Bottom line is that our Senate failed us Blame them for this mess because it could have been avoided.President Barack Obama will meet Monday with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss options for tougher gun restrictions and is expected to announce in the coming days a new executive action with the goal of expanding background checks on gun sales.Described as  imminent  by people familiar with the White House plans, the set of executive actions would fulfill a promise by the President to take further unilateral steps the administration says could help curb gun deaths.Plans for the action are not yet complete, and those familiar with the process warn that unforeseen circumstances could delay an announcement. But gun control advocates are expecting the new actions to be revealed next week, ahead of Obama s annual State of the Union address, set for January 12.The White House wouldn t comment directly on the exact timing or content of Obama s executive orders. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said that the President expected a set of recommendations on unilateral action to arrive at the beginning of the year.Plans began to become clearer on New Year s Day with a White House announcement accompanying Obama s weekly address that on Monday the president would meet with Lynch. Change, as always, is going to take all of us,  Obama said in his weekly address.  The gun lobby is loud and well organized in its defense of effortlessly available guns for anyone. The rest of us are going to have to be just as passionate and well organized in our defense of our kids. That s the work of citizenship   to stand up and fight for the change that we seek.

 Congressional Black Caucus Condemns Trump: He’s A Racist Who Cozies Up To White Supremacists,"Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) condemned Donald Trump and his unbelievably tone-deaf attempt at African-American  outreach,  slamming him as a racist who has spent his entire campaign cozying up to white supremacists.The CBC convened a conference call on Tuesday to denounce Trump, and accused his campaign of not only perpetuating stereotypes but also deliberately dog whistling to white supremacists in an effort to turn their bigotry into votes.Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) said that the Republican nominee is  one of the most racist, sexist and bigoted candidates  to launch a bid for the White House in modern history, and accused Trump of having a  kinship with white supremacists. He knows the audience he s trying to reach out to and it s not African-Americans,  Meeks said.  He s trying to appeal to David Duke and the racists of the world with what they think are stereotypes.   He s trying to appeal to the worst of the white supremacists and others he s been catering to in the campaign to try and help them with turnout. In the past few days, Trump has attempted to pander to minority voters but has done an exceedingly poor job of it. In an effort to garner votes from African-Americans he claimed that their communities are  war zones  and that they live in fear of being shot at any moment. Trump s big selling point was that since black Americans live in poverty, have poor education, and a lack of job opportunities they might as well vote for him. After all, it isn t like they have anything to lose, right?Trump s blatant racism and p*ss poor excuse for minority outreach aren t going over well with African-American voters or lawmakers.CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) blasted Trump for giving speeches supposedly meant to draw black voters to crowds that are overwhelmingly white and said that the GOP nominee s so-called outreach is  a slap in the face  to the African-American community. If Donald Trump truly cared about African-Americans, he d disavow his long history of hateful and racist attacks against our community, he d apologize for having discriminated against black families   he d disavow his support for white supremacists and white supremacy,  Butterfield said.The Democrats taking part in Tuesday s call ripped Trump s past history of discriminatory housing practices during his years as a real estate investor and his habit of exploiting minority workers as a builder.They noted that his campaign has been littered with bigotry from the very beginning when he announced his candidacy by calling all Mexicans  rapists.  Since then, he has been reluctant to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, called for all Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, accused a judge of being incapable of impartiality because of his Mexican heritage, and has refused to believe that President Obama was born in America.In response to Trump and his racist rhetoric, Democrats say they are pushing their minority voter registration efforts into overdrive and plan to set records with black and Hispanic turnout at the polls in November. To say that minority voters are eager to cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton to make sure that Trump never gets anywhere near the White House would be an understatement. Donald Trump is a voter registration machine and a citizenship-advocating engine,  said Rep. Luis Guti rrez (D-Ill.).  This is a little bit of thank you, because our community has never been so united or energized since that moment you set foot in national arena. Trump has said repeatedly that he will do great with African-Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to know what in the world ever gave him that idea, but his  outreach  isn t helping his cause and surely won t convince minority voters to turn a blind eye to the fact that he has built his entire campaign on bigotry.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2016"
 Comey Plans To Tell The World About Trump’s Illegal Requests In BOMBSHELL Testimony,"Former FBI Director James Comey is now one of the most dangerous men in Washington to Donald Trump. There is nothing that could harm Trump like Comey testifying under oath in an open session of Congress   yet that is exactly what Comey plans to do. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly cleared Comey to testify, and boy will that testimony be a doozy.Of course, we all remember the reports that Comey kept meticulous notes on his conversations with Trump, because the orange wannabe  president  unsettled him with his inappropriate requests. We also remember how one of those memos was leaked, and it alleged that Trump tried to obstruct justice. Now, new reports suggest that Comey plans to tell the world about every contentious conversation he ever had with Trump   including the parts where what Trump requested of Comey could indeed amount to obstruction of justice regarding the Russia probe   which is, of course, a felony.Because of the addition of Special Counsel Mueller to the investigation, there will likely be no testimony regarding what is going on inside the investigation himself. However, that matters not in this instance, as it appears that when Comey sits down before the Senate Intelligence Committee, he plans to sing like a canary; in fact, reports say he can t wait to do it. From CNN:But he appears eager to discuss his tense interactions with Trump before his firing, which have now spurred allegations that the president may have tried to obstruct the investigation. If it happens, Comey s public testimony promises to be a dramatic chapter in the months-long controversy, and it will likely bring even more intense scrutiny to an investigation that Trump has repeatedly denounced as a  witch hunt. Indeed, this should be very interesting. We won t have long to wait, either. While there is no date set in stone just yet, Comey s remarks may be up to be scheduled within the next week or two.

 Gender Equality Justice For Unwed American Mothers And Fathers Abroad,"The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down a backward, gender discriminating federal law based on shocking stereotypes   one being that most men hardly care about their children born out of wedlock.Under this law, a child born abroad to an unwed American mother automatically becomes a U.S. citizen if the mother previously lived in the U.S. for a minimum of one year.Under the very same law, a child of an unwed father can t become a U.S. citizen unless the father has lived in the U.S. for a continuous period of five years, two of them when he was over the age of 14.How could this law have such requirements? Who would think this? How did that even pass originally? It s sad and disgusting.Thankfully, the U.S. Supreme Court agrees. They have ruled that these horrid gender lines drawn by Congress violate the Constitution s guarantee to equal protection of the law.The problems with this law were brought forward for scrutiny by Luis Ram n Morales-Santana who born in the Dominican Republic to unwed parents. His mother was from the Dominican Republic while his father was a U.S. citizen.At the time of Morales-Santana s birth, his father was in the Dominican Republic working on a construction project.Morales-Santana came to the U.S. with his parents as a permanent resident. In 2000, after he was convicted of several felonies, the government wanted to deport him.With the law in place, Morales-Santana s father fell short of the requirements for Morales-Santana to qualify for automatic U.S. citizenship. This meant deportation looked plausible.According to NPR, the rule in a typical case would be to extend the favorable treatment of one sex   in this case, women   to men. But with this case, Ginsburg observed, favorable treatment for mothers was the exception to the general rule in the statute.Though the U.S. Supreme Court saw the law s requirements as unconstitutional gender discrimination, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the court was not free to make the exception into the general rule. Instead, she said, it is up to Congress to set the same rule for everyone.Yep. Now it s a matter of convincing Congress to fix their mess of a law. And it gets even worse. According to Ginsburg, the law would have to be equalized by making unwed mothers abide by the tougher citizenship rules that apply to unwed fathers.So there you have it   equality between unwed mothers and unwed fathers for their children s U.S. citizenship. Not what we were all expecting, but it is indeed equal.Featured image via Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images",News,"June 13, 2017"
"New Evidence Shows Foul Play, Cover-up by FBI and OSP in Shooting of LaVoy Finicum – DOJ Opens New Investigation"," 21st Century Wire says The mainstream media called it  case closed  after the FBI released its aerial footage of the ambush and shooting of LaVoy Finicum. Now, new evidence reveals that there was likely foul play and a misrepresentation by Federal and State authorities involved in the recent killing of rancher and protester LaVoy Finicum.As 21WIRE reported at the time (although ignored by the Oregonian and other mainstream media outlets) that without any audio track to synch with the FBI s aerial footage, it was impossible to really tell when shots were fired and if the official story was actually true. At the time, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Greg Bretzing, insisted that their footage provided an  honest and unfiltered view  of what happened. However, new evidence tells different story, and appears to demonstrate exactly how the official story was intentionally distorted by authorities   in order to cover-up what really happened that day.At yesterday s Deschutes County Sheriff s Office press conference, officials claimed that the state trooper tactical team members were  justified  in killing Finicum because the officers  feared for their lives.  However, authorities are now saying that the FBI agents involved are now being investigated for firing shots  and never reporting them.Mike Arnold, an attorney representing the Bundys explained on Tuesday,  The public deserved to have the video, with audio and sound, released immediately after the shooting. Now we know why it wasn t released: the public would have heard the shots that the government didn t want it to hear. The following presentation revealed at yesterday s press conference shows previously released FBI aerial footage synched together with a newly released cellphone video from passenger Shauna Cox recorded while inside Finicum s truck. Among other things, this new video proves that police fired first on the vehicle before anyone had even exited the vehicle. Watch: Most importantly, this new evidence reveals what happened immediately after that crash, and this could very well lead to criminal charges against the FBI agents and members of the Oregon State Police tactical units. According to today s Washington Post: Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson said two bullets believed to be fired by FBI agents did not strike Finicum, who was hit by three rounds fired by state troopers. But Nelson announced at a news conference Tuesday that because the FBI agents  did not disclose their shots to investigators, nor did they disclose specific actions they took after the shooting,  his office and the Justice Department would both investigate. The new video, combined with a brand new disclosure by a team of local investigators points towards a conspiracy by agents and members of an  elite national unit  who appear to have lied about events at the police ambush and LaVoy Finicum s death   has now prompted a new investigation by the U.S. Justice Department, led by Inspector General Michael Horowitz.Finicum Shot in the BackAmong other details, newly released findings show that two state troopers shot Finicum three times in the back during the police ambush Jan. 26, 2016. An autopsy revealed that one of the bullets pierced Finicum s heart.Another shocking point of this investigation shows the complete incompetence and negligence on the part of officers positioned in front and behind LaVoy Finicum   creating a dangerous  cross-fire  situation, something which professional officers are taught to avoid, for obvious reasons.Mainstream Yellow JournalismThe mainstream media are still standing by their slanted terminology by describing the incident as a  traffic stop , presumably to downplay the premeditated operation by Federal and State authorities to intercept the two vehicles (both the Oregonian, the Washington Post and many other mainstream media outlets all used this skewed language at the time).Clearly, by any sober estimation of the incident, this was an elaborate, staged ambush involving dozens of vehicles and special tactical teams, and yet every mainstream media news outlet covered the incident with a pro-government bias where the victim was assumed guilty while the government was assumed innocent. Not surprisingly, this coverage quickly turned public opinion against Finicum and anyone else protesting similar issues. One example of the public hate that was generated against Finicum can be found in the comment section of many articles on the website Gawker where Gawker readers celebrated Finicum s death:Tens of thousands of similar hate comments can be found throughout many mainstream media articles and on social media. This fact proves how pivotal the mainstream media s skewed coverage was in turning sections of the population against the protesters in Oregon   despite the fact that Finicum s killing was an obvious ambush and a clear escalation of violence on the part of the government.Stay tuned for more updates at 21WIRE.SEE MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Standoff Files",Middle-east,"March 9, 2016"
 Trevor Noah Roasts Jeb Bush’s Pathetically Desperate Effort To Remain A Viable Candidate (VIDEO),"If Jeb Bush watched The Daily Show last night, he should finally throw in the towel before he embarrasses himself and his family even more than he has already.On Monday night, Trevor Noah torched George W. Bush s brother in a hilarious segment that began with Noah referring to Jeb as the most desperate candidate in the presidential field. He s so desperate, he s even released his own fragrance for men,  Noah quipped. Dubbed  Desperation by Jeb!,  Noah promoted the scent as being  for when being yourself just isn t enough.  He then took a whiff and laughingly remarked,  Smells like George Bush. But it got even worse for Jeb from there.Noah reported that Bush and his supporters have spent more money on ads than anyone else, but that for all of the $40 million spent on positive ads telling voters about Bush, it has resulted in zero returns.This is a private admission from advisers to Jeb s own SuperPAC, Right To Rise. Even a Bush supporter was embarrassed by the results, exclaiming that,  You might as well light all of this money on fire. An amused Noah pointed out that it s pretty messed up when your campaign spending is failing so bad that burning the money would have been just as useful. That would have been more effective for Jeb Bush because at least people would have gathered around him for the warmth of the fire. People notice a fire. They don t notice Jeb Bush. The money could have been put to better use by building a new water system for Flint, Michigan, Noah added.Instead, Bush spent a lot of the money on video mailers featuring a Bush documentary that were actually mailed to his supporters and potential voters, something that Noah found to be such a huge waste of money that he was rendered speechless for a few seconds before regaining his composure to nail Jeb with another zinger. Poor Jeb, he s so desperate for his videos to go viral he s willing to physically mail them to your house. Still, Jeb Bush hadn t reached the bottom of the desperation pot.Noah then revealed that Bush had enlisted his mother to appear in an ad touting him as the one candidate who  seems  to be able to solve the country s problems. The Daily Show host noted that Jeb s own mom didn t sound sold on her son s qualifications as presidential material. It s like a guy getting his mom to hit people up on Tinder for him,  he said, which led to a video clip showing an exchange between Bush and a voter. Bush asked the voter who she is voting for. After she replied that she  didn t know yet,  Bush responded,  Oh, come on. And thus a new campaign slogan was born.Here s the video via Comedy Central.Seriously, Jeb. Do America a favor and put yourself out of our misery. It s probably the only thing you can do that people will support.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 26, 2016"
BLACK CAUCUS MEMBER James Clyburn Suggests RACISM Is Motive For Rep. John Conyers Sexual Assault Accusers…”These Are All WHITE Women” [VIDEO],"U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn could find himself in hot water.A writer for The New York Times Magazine and National Geographic tweeted that Clyburn invoked the name of Susan Smith, South Carolina s infamous child murderer, in his defense of Conyers. James Clyburn compared Conyers  accusers to the child murderer Susan Smith, who initially claimed a black man had abducted her kids. Clyburn said, these are all white women who ve made these charges against Conyers,  Robert Draper tweeted.When asked if that comment was true, Draper said he verified it through two sources, adding  Clyburn has used the Susan Smith parallel more than once, to members & staffers. Clyburn responded on Twitter, saying  This is inaccurate in many regards. The Congressional Black Caucus tweeted about the alleged Susan Smith comment, saying Clyburn  used the Smith example to illustrate the dangers of convicting people before getting all the facts. Umm yeah, sure he did.Meanwhile, Clyburn just kept digging a deeper hole. Following his baseless and disgusting and racist claims to Congress, Clyburn was met in the basement of Congress, where he was asked about fellow Black Caucus member and accused serial sexual assaulter, Rep. John Conyers (D-MI). His response was stunning.When asked about sexual harassment allegations against colleague Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Clyburn seemed to suggest elected officials should be held to a different standard than other public figures.In a video posted on Twitter, the 77-year-old Clyburn is walking to an elevator with Congressional Black Caucus chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.), when asked  Other men in other industries have faced similar accusations   and gotten out of the way, resign, stepped down, far faster than he has, right   Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer?

 WATCH: Celebrities Unite To Send POWERFUL Message To Electoral College Asking Them To Dump Trump,"December 19th could be the day 38 electors step up to courageously save our nation from the insanity of Donald Trump.On that day, which is often overlooked as a afterthought by most Americans, all 538 electors from all 50 states will gather in Washington D.C. to cast their votes for president. Usually, the electors merely certify the results that were tallied on Election Day.But the Founding Fathers created the Electoral College as a mechanism to prevent unqualified demagogues like Trump from becoming president. In short, it s the last line of defense our country has if ignorant voters manage to elect a threat into the highest office.For the first time in our history, the electors have the chance to do exactly that, and a group of celebrities, including West Wing actor Martin Sheen, M.A.S.H actors Loretta Swit and Mike Farrell, Will & Grace actress Debra Messing, along with many others, are uniting to encourage and support the 38 electors required to block Trump from becoming president.In a video, Sheen and others explain that Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers that the role of the Electoral College is to guarantee that the presidency is held by someone  To an eminent degree, endowed with the requisite qualifications  to be President of the United States. They then call on these 38 people to be heroes and do the right thing.Donald Trump is not that someone, so it is up to the Electoral College to do what it was meant to do and vote for someone else.Here s the video via YouTube:A petition has been circulating since last month asking the electors to vote their conscience rather than allowing Trump to take office and destroy this country. It currently has nearly five million signatures. But unlike the petition, Sheen and his fellow entertainers are not asking the electors to vote for Hillary Clinton. They simply want them to make sure Trump can t be president. And that can happen if 38 electors vote for anyone but Trump. They could even vote for a different Republican, preferably a sane Republican who won t burn our government and this country to the ground.This is especially critical now that the CIA and 17 other intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia meddled with our political process to help Trump win.The Electoral College exists as a safeguard for this reason. And it is their duty as Americans to correct the mistake made on Election Day.Featured image via screenshot",News,"December 14, 2016"

 Adviser Who Oversaw Obama’s Infrastructure Plan Blows IMMENSE Hole In Trump’s Plan,"One of Trump s biggest campaign promises was to create jobs, and right now his plan is a massive, trillion-dollar infrastructure program. Sounds fantastic, right? Sure, it ll cost money, but it ll mean thousands of jobs and we get our crumbling infrastructure back into shape. Sweet!Or not, says former Obama adviser Ron Klain. Those trillions won t be poured directly into projects   they ll go to investors who then may or may not back needed infrastructure projects. Klain oversaw the implementation of President Obama s  Recovery Act  of 2009 and knows a thing or two about this, and he believes Trump s plan is actually a massive trap: Trump s plan provides tax breaks to private-sector investors who back profitable construction projects. These projects (such as electrical grid modernization or energy pipeline expansion) might already be planned or even underway. There s no requirement that the tax breaks be used for incremental or otherwise expanded construction efforts; they could all go just to fatten the pockets of investors in previously planned projects. How bloody fantastic   more tax cuts for the rich. In other words, the plan may or may not create jobs for Americans. It may or may not actually give us the influx of dollars we need to repair our decaying infrastructure. It s a very pretty Mardi Gras mask placed over what s basically more government welfare for the rich and powerful.In fact, Klain points out that there s no guarantee that this will create jobs because there s no requirement that those dollars go to unfunded projects. He also says that it s not likely to go to projects that aren t profitable for investors, such as expanding and rebuilding water grids or repairing existing roads and bridges.These investors could see up to $85 billion apiece with which they have to do nothing. Without the necessary strings, those trillion dollars will effectively be flushed down the toilet while rich investors make themselves richer.And Democrats jumping on board with this plan are busy collecting their 30 pieces of silver. According to Klain, it didn t go so well for them when they backed either Ronald Reagan s or George W. Bush s tax cut plans because ultimately, those plans increased inequality and blew holes in the federal budget. Democrats sold themselves out on those plans, though, and they re selling out again on this one.Worse, though, Trump s infrastructure plan could actually open the door to Republicans who want to weaken things like wage protection and union representation for construction workers. Both of these will badly harm Americans, including, and perhaps especially, the white working class.Democrats are taking a lot of heat over an idea that they needed to focus far more heavily on white, rural America during the election, and some Democrats have jumped on the Trump train s infrastructure ideas and are calling it a  jobs plan.  Except it s not, and it will probably hurt the working class even more. At the bare minimum, it won t help them, and then they ll blame Democrats for it because reasons.They ll blame Democrats if Trump s infrastructure plan doesn t go through, too. In other words, Democrats can t win for losing, even though Trump is the cartoon villain who deserves to have this land squarely on his head like a piano or a giant anvil.Trump s setting us up for a trillion dollar failure. All he and the Republicans care about are enriching the already rich. Klain is right. This is a trap, and we need to beware.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"November 19, 2016"
 BUSTED: Trump’s Pick For Top USDA Scientist Is NOT A Scientist At All,"The USDA, responsible for everything from our food safety to climate change, is soon to get a new Chief Scientist who under the 2008 Farm Bill will be chosen  from among distinguished scientist with significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics.  The problem is, Trump s choice for this high-responsibility position is Sam Clovis, who has none of these credentials.Clovis is a business professor at Morningside College, is publicly skeptical of climate change and has never even taken a science course during his graduate studies. What s worse is that he is most known for being a conservative talk show radio host for  Impact with Sam Clovis  in Iowa. Touting that the only reason Obama wasn t impeached was because of his race, he came out as a fierce pro-Trump advocate while running an unsuccessful camping for Senate in 2014.As the current senior White House advisor for the USDA, Clovis has been described as  Trump s eyes and ears  at the agency. Clovis also takes credit for recruiting Carter Page, Trump s foreign policy advisor who s being scrutinized for his ties to Russia.The appointment of Clovis as the USDA Chief Scientist was compared to appointing someone without any medical credentials to lead the National Institutes of Health, by Obama Administration Scientists.Clovis has expressed repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, and has called efforts for climate action  simply a mechanism for transferring wealth from one group of people to another.  He has promised that the Trump USDA will take a new direction, focusing on lessening regulation and boosting trade, rather than addressing climate change.Catherine Woteki, a Ph.D. holder in nutrition and the USDA s undersecretary for research states,  access to safe food and clean air and water is absolutely fundamental to personal security,  and adding that scientific research is critical to the job.  Food system are widely recognized by the national security community as being part of critical infrastructure. It looks like our access to safe food, fresh water, and clean air are now in the hands of non-scientists who wants to use the USDA for capital gains instead of the security of our natural resources.Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2017"
"Trump Isn’t Going to Invade Venezuela, But What US is Planning Could Be Much Worse","Andrew Korybko The DuranTrump was more aggressive than usual yesterday when he said that he s not ruling out a  military option  in Venezuela, and the international media went haywire speculating that the President was considering an invasion. Nothing justifies what Trump said, but taking aside all moral considerations, his statement shouldn t have been surprising, and interestingly enough, it might even backfire on him.All US Presidents routinely restate the rhetoric that  all options are on the table  when dealing with the crises that their country provoked abroad, which in this case is the Hybrid War on Venezuela that seeks to attain proxy control over the world s largest oil reserves in the Orinoco River Belt and smash the socialist-multipolar ALBA grouping.Venezuela s preexisting socio-political vulnerabilities and institutional weaknesses were exploited by the US  economic machinations against the country in order to trigger a Color Revolution against the government. When that failed, the regime change movement transformed into an urban insurgency and recently expanded its operations by staging a terrorist attack against a military base in the central part of the country.It s very likely that the situation will devolve into an externally triggered  civil war  with the eventual intent of sparking a military coup attempt against President Maduro, but the odds of the US directly intervening in this scenario are slim. Rather, Trump s threatened  military option  probably relates to the  Lead From Behind  role that the US is slated to play in using Colombia as its regional partner for funneling weapons and other forms of assistance to the  moderate rebels  in Venezuela just as it used Turkey to do vis-a-vis Syria for the past six years. Additionally, it can be confidently assumed that the CIA is hard at work trying to engineer its desired military coup, though the chances of its success are unlikely unless the Hybrid War becomes a full-fledged externally triggered  civil war  like in Syria. These two interconnected reasons explain what Trump meant by refusing to rule out a  military option , though there s admittedly the extreme case that can t be discounted whereby a  humanitarian intervention  of varying scale is unleashed in the final stages of the crisis in order to decisively topple the government at its weakest moment.No matter what the US ultimately does or doesn t do, however, Trump s braggadocious statement might actually backfire on him by increasing President Maduro s appeal among the on-the-fence members of the so-called  opposition . It s one thing to detest an elected leader and hope for his downfall, but it s another to actively support the foreign invasion of one s country by the hemisphere s traditional hegemon, especially given the US  bloody history of military activity in the Americas across the past century.Trump s comments therefore put the US  regime change proxies in a bind because they re now caught in a dilemma between supporting what the world at large perceives to be a threat to invade their country or to support its legitimate leader whom they ve been rioting against for months already. The average anti-government supporter can be presumed to be equally against Maduro, a speculated US invasion of their country, and the  opposition s  riots, wanting only to hold snap elections in the hope of peacefully carrying out regime change.They ve been backing the  opposition  up until this point, however, because they saw them as the  least-bad  option available, but Trump s implied military threat essentially exposes them in acting as the tip of the spear in a possible invasion, seeing as how the chaotic  civil war  conditions in which the US could conventionally intervene in Venezuela would be due to their intensified Hybrid War actions.This fact should rightly give pause to self-identifying  patriotic opposition  members and prompt them to reconsider their  least-bad  normative assessment that they previously gave to the  opposition . If they engage in some serious self-reflection, they ll see that it s actually President Maduro who s the  least bad  of the two, and that the best way to achieve their objective of regime change is to begrudgingly wait until the next democratic vote is scheduled to be held.Continuing to throw one s weight behind the  opposition  at this point is tantamount to openly supporting the steps that are needed to create the conditions for Trump s media-hyped  military options  against their country, up to and including a  humanitarian intervention . It s not known what proportion of the  opposition  satisfies the  patriotic  criteria that these points would apply to, but if their numbers are large enough, then their passive  defection  from the anti-government movement s ranks in response to Trump s threat could deal a blow to the regime change effort.On the other hand, and approaching the subject from a cynical angle as the  devil s advocate , it might not tangibly change much at all if the US already has its mind dead-set on escalating the Hybrid War on Venezuela to a Syrian-like level, though it would nevertheless represent an important moral victory for the legitimate government by further exposing the  opposition s  treasonous connivance with the US.In any case, regardless of what Trump really meant in his  military options  comment and despite whatever the  patriotic opposition  members decide to do, all indications suggest that Venezuela is at a fateful turning point and that the coming weeks will decide its future for what might end up being the years to come.*** Author and geopolitical analyst Andrew Korybko and contributor to 21st Century Wire.

 Trump’s Newest Foreign Policy Advisor Is One Of The Dumbest People To Ever Serve In Congress,"If you weren t having nightmares before about Donald Trump potentially having the nuclear codes, his latest choice for national security advisor should keep you up for months, or at least until November 9th. He has chosen, as a national security advisor, a woman who believes the earth is six million years old and that the world is ending very, very soon anyway. That woman is the former Congresswoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann.The campaign hasn t yet confirmed that Bachmann is advising on matters of foreign policy, but she is advising him on evangelical matters and she was, in a bit of tragic irony, part of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence when she was still in Congress. To some who have no idea about anything outside the borders of our country (Donald Trump), it would be logical to believe that she s an expert on foreign policy. She s not.As for her reputed position as a foreign policy advisor on Trump s team, Bachmann says this:The former Minnesota congresswoman attended a fundraiser in the state for Trump on Saturday, where she revealed to the press that she has his ear on foreign policy. He also recognizes there is a threat around the world, not just here in Minnesota, of radical Islam,  she said, according to MPR News.  I wish our President Obama also understood the threat of radical Islam and took it seriously. He s a common-sense guy, not into political correctness,  Bachmann added, according to the Star Tribune.Source: The HillLet s forget for a moment that Bachmann is a disaster on social issues. She hates gay people. She thinks the Founding Fathers outlawed slavery. She is anti-science. She s an anti-government conspiracy theorist. She thinks half of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion. She thinks that there would be no unemployment if there were no minimum wage. She thinks the U.S. is running out of rich people.As for her foreign expertise, she believes that the United States wants some sort of global currency. She believes Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. That would be Tel Aviv. She believes Sharia Law is around every corner. More significantly, she believes that there s no point in making the world a better place because Jesus will come vacuum everyone up to Heaven within the very near future. We know that there is more prophecy of Jesus  second coming even than there was in the first,  she said.  We also should be encouraged and empowered as believers in Jesus Christ   now more than ever   with the Bible in one hand, the newspaper in another, to say to our neighbors and co-workers and people at church, this is about the Lord speaking to the world that,  I am coming soon.

We told you exactly what you needed to do and you did nothing,  one man told the city council members at the meeting.Two protesters who were holding a sign that read  Blood on your hands  climbed up on top of the dais, at which point several members of the city council got scared and ran away. Police eventually removed several people from the meeting and arrested at least three of them, which prompted the crowd to chant Shame  and  Shut it down. Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy, was the only official who had the guts to stay and try to negotiate with the protesters, who have every right to be pissed off that Nazis were given a permit to spread their hate and violence throughout Charlottesville. The protesters called for Mayor Mike Signer to resign from his position, chanting  Signer must go! After making it abundantly clear that they do not appreciate the city council inviting white supremacists to town, they also demanded the removal of Confederate monuments from Charlottesville. The city agreed to begin the removal process and a motion was approved by the council that will commemorate the victims of the Nazi rally by draping black fabric over the statues.Watch more on the mayhem here, via WVIR: NBC29 WVIR Charlottesville, VA News, Sports and WeatherFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"August 22, 2017"
SHOCKING VIDEOS Prove That Hillary Is Willing To Endanger Lives In U.S. And Abroad To Protect Her Political Ambitions,"Do Americans even remember the worldwide violence and hate inspired by Hillary s announcement that the Benghazi attack was a result of an amateur anti-Islam video? She was willing to throw the entire world under the bus to save her political career Watch video below, as our American flag is being ripped down and replaced by ISIS flag on our U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Note the ISIS flags being carried by protesters of the anti-Islam movie that Hillary told the world was caused the Benghazi attack.Who would hire a woman to lead our country when she was willing to watch the world burn and create violent clashes around the world in order to cover up her ineptness as a Secretary of State?And then there s the condemnation of America by a Washington DC imam that demand the American Embassy in Cairo needed to be attacked because of the anti-Islam film. Of course, his rhetoric was overlooked because the real issue is of course, Americans who are  islamaphobic https://youtu.be/K_QcAfXwOJoThe violent anti US protest that shut down Sydney turning the city streets into a bloody battle field have been condemned by leaders on all levels.

 Fiscally Conservative GOP Governor Begs The Public To Pay His Bills For Him,"Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has blown so much money on his vanity presidential campaign that he put himself $1.2 million dollars in debt. An odd accomplishment for a  fiscally conservative  Republican who says that our government s debt is the most evil thing ever.Walker is trying to sell off the surplus garbage campaign merchandise that nobody wanted to buy the first time around, in order to cover his debts. He sent out an e-mail begging people to buy t-shirts from him for $45. If you really want to wear a t-shirt which will announce to everyone how stupid you are, you can find similar Walker merch online for about half the price.Walker isn t even able to fulfill color or size requests due to a  lack of resources.  He wants you to pay 45 bucks for something you may not even want to, or be physically able to, wear properly. Don t worry, though! If you get a shirt that is 3 sizes too small or a hideous color, he also said in the e-mail that the shirts can be framed or used for  crafty things  like a pillow cover or bag.That  exactly what I d do; Lay my head on a Scott Walker pillow as I stare at a Scott Walker framed t-shirt on my wall.Walker dropped $90,000 a day on his 70-day presidential run, which is a fact he isn t divulging to the people he s asking for cash. 70 days is pretty impressive to go from the great white right-wing hope to  Scott who? In the e-mail that he sent out to the people who are now upset that they forgot to unsubscribe from his mailing list months ago, Walker made some strange statements about how careful he is with money. If there is one thing the American people learned about me during our presidential campaign, it is that I am thrifty. Source: APWalker then went on to cite how he uses coupons and loves hitting up the discount racks when shopping. Do they give coupons for failed presidential vanity campaigns intended for boosting speaking fees and book deals?There s $1,200,000 worth of irony to be found in a  thrifty  guy, who is against big spending, asking people to waste 45 bucks on what is essentially an  I m with stupid  t-shirt. He would need a little over 26,000 people who are bad enough with their money to think this is a good deal, in order to cover his debt.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty ",News,"April 12, 2016"
 Karma In All Its Glory: Republican Chairwoman Forced To Resign Over ‘Obama Is A Chimp’ Facebook Post,"A little over a month ago, Linda Sorenson, the Republican Chair for Delta County, Colorado, posted the following Facebook meme:Oh those wacky Republicans and their unbelievable racism!At first, Sorenson was defiant in the face of public condemnation, stating, I really don t care if people are offended by it,  she told me of the post, which was sent to me by a source.  Un-friend me. Stop looking at me on Facebook.  After all, this is a new day in America. This is Donald Trump s America and gosh darn it! White people won t stand for being oppressed by the PC Police any longer! Let freedumb ring!But a funny thing about Trump s America it doesn t actually exist. At least not yet. And certainly not in the very purple state of Colorado. Clearly, Sorenson thought the people would rally to her bigoted side. Instead, according to the The Daily Sentinel:That posting not only prompted calls of her resignation from fellow Delta County Republicans, but also from several outside groups, including the Colorado branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance.Whoops.In the face of all of this pressure, Sorenson changed her story from,  I m racist and I m proud!  to the perennial favorite of politicians who make a social media blunder:  Someone hacked my account! I m the victim here! After four  accountability meetings  though, including an investigation into Sorenson violating party rules by endorsing a local Republican primary candidate, Sorenson saw the writing on the Facebook wall and resigned. The Republicans Central Committee was quick to distance themselves:Suppes, who is not a member of the central committee, said it was an appropriate move. There s no room for racism, intended or unintended, in society,  he said.  It s best for the party, best for the county, that she step down. On the one hand, bravo to the Colorado GOP for dealing with this appropriately. On the other, Sorenson is hardly an outlier. Republicans have spent decades turning their party into a haven for racism and bigotry in all its many forms. Sorenson was simply stupid enough to say it out loud; a trend that has been exacerbated, but certainly not started, by Donald Trump.I wonder who she ll blame for her downfall? I m going to guess Obama. What do you think?Featured image via screencap",News,"July 3, 2016"
Does The $100 Million Given To Clintons By Gulf Sheikhs Disqualify Hillary For Candidacy?,"DOESN T THIS COMPROMISE HER ABILITY TO BE OBJECTIVE?Bill and Hillary Clinton received at least $100 million from autocratic Persian Gulf states and their leaders, potentially undermining Democratic presidential candidate Hillary s claim she can carry out independent Middle East policies.As a presidential candidate, the amount of foreign cash the Clintons have amassed from the Persian Gulf states is  simply unprecedented,  says national security analyst Patrick Poole.  These regimes are buying access. You ve got the Saudis. You ve got the Kuwaitis, Oman, Qatar and the UAE. There are massive conflicts of interest. It s beyond comprehension,  Poole told TheDCNF in an interview. Overall, the Clinton Foundation has received upwards of $85 million in donations from five Persian Gulf states and their monarchs, according to the foundation s website.Activist groups have charged the five states   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)   committed numerous human rights abuses.For years, the accusations have centered on the Persian Gulf practice of importing hundreds of thousands of poor foreign laborers who work for low wages, including hundreds of thousands of female  domestic workers  who have no labor rights and often face exploitation and sexual abuse.The ongoing Clinton financial relationship with despotic Persian Gulf states could hurt Hillary as a supporter of labor rights and tarnish her image as a vigorous supporter of women.Yet as secretary of state, Clinton consciously and actively sought to legitimize the sheikdoms through many new Department of State programs.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"May 12, 2016"
HOW PEOPLE MAGAZINE COVER Proves Hillary Has ALWAYS Been Wildly Unpopular With Women,"Does anyone else get the sense Hillary is not quite as popular with Americans as the media would like us to believe? She can barely fill a phone booth with supporters at her rallies and the activity with her social media accounts pale in comparison to Donald Trump s. Will the media be able to convince enough Americans that voters actually like or trust Hillary by November? Flashback to 2014, before the full-force of Hillary s reckless handling of highly classified emails put our national security at risk: People magazine has been a propaganda arm of the Left for decades. The June 16, 2014 cover promoting Hillary as our next President is no exception. Unfortunately, the propagandists at People Magazine underestimated the disinterest and dislike Americans had for Hillary Clinton when they made the decision to place her on their cover.According to AdWeek s report on the best and worst covers of 2014, the Clinton cover was People s most unpopular cover of the year, selling only 503,890 copies.Considering that 70% of People magazine s readers are women, this embarrassing cover flop should be of great concern to the campaign of the first female candidate for President Watch:The most successful cover? Unsurprisingly, Robin Williams memorial issue from August sold a total of 1,169,800 copies.- Huffington PostThis is just more proof of how UNpopular Hillary Clinton truly is with American voters and most especially with a demographic she can t afford to lose women voters.",politics,"Aug 16, 2016"
 Trump Sends Out Email Begging Supporters To Send Him Money To Defend Against His Scandals,"Minutes after news broke that Donald Trump had asked James Comey to drop his investigation into Michael Flynn   and that Comey had kept documentation of that meeting unbeknownst to Trump   Trump s never-ending campaign arm shot out an email asking his supporters to send him money. The grifting never stops.In the email, DonaldJTrump.com tells Trump s followers that there is a vast conspiracy against him by people who don t want him to  drain the swamp.  According to the tortured logic, these secret  special interest  groups conspired to destroy him by leaking the criminal and boneheaded things that he has been doing. And naturally, the  media  was also involved:You already knew the media was out to get us.But sadly it s not just the fake news  There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire America First movement.Steve Bannon was right when he said,  If you think they re going to give you your country back without a fight, you re sadly mistaken.

Just out from Trump campaign subject lined ""SABOTAGE"" pic.twitter.com/w7xy0L47oF  Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) May 16, 2017Trump s team promises that the next step is to  completely DRAIN THE SWAMP.  It s unclear how Trump plans to do that when his Secretary of State is an oil executive, half his staff comes from Goldman Sachs, and his own daughter has an office down the hall from the Oval Office.The wording in the email suggests that Trump and his band of followers are retreating even further into their own paranoid delusions. The leaks Trump is so concerned about have been independently confirmed time and again. Trump himself, in his own blustering way, often confirms reports about himself in fits of rage. In the most recent example, Trump took to Twitter to loudly acknowledge that he had given sensitive information to Russia despite his own staff saying it was  false  the night before.Left with few options, Trump is now declaring all out war on the truth. Any bad press is  fake news  and  deep state  malcontents trying to undermine him. The much more realistic idea that Trump himself is so completely incompetent that he brings these scandals on himself never occurs to him.Featured image by Michael Reynolds-Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017"
WHY LET THE ATHEISTS Run All Over You? City Removes Bench Honoring Veterans,"A city in Pennsylvania is removing a park bench with a religious quote in order to placate angry atheists. The atheists wants to put their own bench there instead: This bench was put there to honor veterans! Is nothing sacred anymore? The site reads:  The quote by William Penn, appearing on the Tyrants Bench, honors Pennsylvania s founding father, as well as the men and women who gave their lives to protect the rights of all U.S. citizens Men who aren t governed by God, will be governed by tyrants Does anyone else see the irony in this quote? OIL CITY, Pa.   An atheist group in New Jersey is seeking the removal of a bench at a Pennsylvania park that is meant to honor veterans due to an inscription of a quote attributed to the state s founder that mentions God. American Atheists (AA) recently sent a letter to the mayor of Oil City to request that the Justus Park bench, which was donated in 2003 by a local branch of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), be removed out of its belief that its inscribed text violates the U.S. Constitution.  Men who aren t governed by God, will be governed by tyrants,  the bench reads, paraphrasing a quote that is often attributed to Pennsylvania founder William Penn, a Quaker who wrote a number of theological books and who once stood trial for  causing a tumult  in preaching in the streets. AA contends that the quote violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which instructs that  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.  The group also says the text is disrespectful to non-Christians. The Tyrants Bench contains an overtly religious message which endorses one particular religious viewpoint: Christianity. The statement that  Men who aren t governed by God will be governed by tyrants  not only has absolutely nothing to do with honoring our service members, but is derisive toward the all non-Christian American service members who have served and died for this country,  its letter asserted. It offered to provide a secular bench in exchange for the current display.Read more: Christian News",politics,"May 6, 2017"
 WATCH: Republican Kentucky Governor Calls For Bloody Rebellion If Hillary Clinton Is Elected,"While Donald Trump is urging gun owners to assassinate Hillary Clinton before the election, Kentucky GOP Governor Matt Bevin is suggesting a bloody rebellion if she is elected.In a move that should make Kentucky voters hang their heads in shame, Bevin appeared before a crowd at the Values Voter Summit on Saturday and instantly made conservative  Christians  even more paranoid and bloodthirsty than they already were by claiming that Hillary Clinton is a tyrant who will destroy America if she is allowed to be in charge for very long. We don t have multiple options,  he said.  We re going one way or we re going the other way, politically, spiritually, morally, economically, from a liberty standpoint. We re going one way or we re going the other way. Bevin painted liberals as un-American for preventing conservative  Christians  from declaring America a Christian nation and instituting the Bible as the law of the land in place of the Constitution. They try to silence us. They try to get us to shut our mouths. They try to embarrass us. Don t be embarrassed. We were not redeemed to have a spirit of timidity. Be bold. There s enough Neville Chamberlains in the world. Be a Winston Churchill There are quite enough sheep already. Be a shepherd. After declaring that  America is worth fighting for, ideologically,  Bevin suggested spilling blood if that s what it takes to keep Hillary Clinton and the Democrats out of power. Somebody asked me yesterday, I did an interview and they said,  Do you think it s possible, if Hillary Clinton were to win the election, do you think it s possible that we ll be able to survive? That we would ever be able to recover as a nation? And while there are people who have stood on this stage and said we would not, I would beg to differ. But I will tell you this: I do think it would be possible, but at what price? At what price? The roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? The blood, of who? The tyrants to be sure, but who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren. I have nine children. It breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something, to reclaim something, that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away. Here s the video via YouTube:Earlier this year at one of his rallies, Donald Trump suggested that  Second Amendment people  could do something to prevent Hillary Clinton from picking Supreme Court nominees. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people   maybe there is, I don t know. And now a very extreme conservative Republican governor is taking that idea and running with it, proving that Hillary was right to call Trump supporters deplorable.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,"September 12, 2016"
 Conservative Supreme Court Ruling Just Gave The Oil Companies A Big Win,"In what is considered a massive set-back not just to Obama s environmental policy, but to the very planet we live on, the Supreme Court just killed the best chance America had to combat climate change in the foreseeable future. And if you think this wasn t politically motivated   the five Justices responsible all come from the right side of the bench.In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled to stay the requirements that energy companies needed to rein in the ludicrous amount of carbon that they were pouring into the atmosphere. For decades, scientists have warned that this carbon is among the number one contributors to global warming. Obama had hoped to address this with a landmark move to curtail these emissions with an initiative he named the  Clean Power Plan. With strong but achievable standards for power plants, and customized goals for states to cut the carbon pollution that is driving climate change, the Clean Power Plan provides national consistency, accountability and a level playing field while reflecting each state s energy mix. It also shows the world that the United States is committed to leading global efforts to address climate change.Or not.Instead, America s right-wing showed the world once again that it is not remotely serious about trying to combat climate change. Naturally, this lack of initiative gives other major polluters like China a fantastic excuse to not curtail their own emissions. We will, when you do, they might say.For now, the oil and gas companies get to ignore the rule. This is a major victory for the corporations that are most responsible for polluting in the first place. The Koch brothers, of course, were vehemently opposed to the new plans. So too were the Republican politicians they sponsor. How desperate were Republicans to let their pollution-heavy friends off the hook? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell broke with all existing protocol to deliver a letter to all 50 United States governors telling them to simply ignore Obama s EPA requirements altogether.The four liberal justices   Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan   all wrote that they objected to the stay.But if all of this shady monkey wrench tossing is giving you a sense of hopeless, the silver lining is this: All that is standing in the way of bold new plans like this becoming law are five aging conservative members of the Supreme Court. It s expected that the next president will get to appoint at least two new Justices. The ability to change the course of not just America s, but the world s climate rests with who Americans chose as their next president this year. That s a lot of power. Let s use it to elect a person who has our interests in mind, not the Koch brothers.Feature image from YouTube ",News,"February 9, 2016"

BENGHAZI BOMBSHELL: “SECRET” DOCS TARGET WHAT AND WHEN OBAMA KNEW ABOUT PLANNED BENGHAZI ATTACK,"Bravo for Judicial Watch! What would we do without them-they have pushed for the truth on so many things about Benghazi but other things that have happened during the lawless Obama years. Thanks to Judicial Watch for finally getting to the bottom of this!Judicial Watch Docs Reveal Obama Admin KNEW Al Qaeda Terrorists Planned Benghazi 10 Days In Advance (Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained more than 100 pages of previously classified  Secret  documents from the Department of Defense (DOD)and the Department of State revealing that DOD almost immediately reported that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was committed by the al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood-linked  Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman  (BCOAR), and had been planned at least 10 days in advance. Rahman is known as the Blind Sheikh, and is serving life in prison for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terrorist acts. The new documents also provide the first official confirmation that shows the U.S. government was aware of arms shipments from Benghazi to Syria. The documents also include an August 2012 analysis warning of the rise of ISIS and the predicted failure of the Obama policy of regime change in Syria.The documents were released in response to a court order in accordance with a May 15, 2014, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed against both the DOD and State Department seeking communications between the two agencies and congressional leaders  on matters related to the activities of any agency or department of the U.S. government at the Special Mission Compound and/or classified annex in Benghazi. Spelling and punctuation is duplicated in this release without corrections.A Defense Department document from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), dated September 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack, details that the attack on the compound had been carefully planned by the BOCAR terrorist group  to kill as many Americans as possible.  The document was sent to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Obama White House National Security Council.

 NYC Police Brutally Arrest Postal Worker After Nearly Hitting His Truck (VIDEO),"For Glen Grays, a 27-year-old New York City postal worker March 17 was not a typical day. That s because Grays was arrested after criticizing a police officer s driving.Grays was making deliveries in the neighborhood of Crown Heights in Brooklyn when a car almost hit his mail truck. Grays then did what most drivers would do if they were in the same situation   he yelled at the person driving the vehicle for his reckless behavior.What Grays didn t know is that the vehicle was an unmarked police car. It is at this point that four plainclothes police officers get out of the unmarked police car and begin to harass Grays. The incident was recorded by passersby on their cell phones. You can watch the video below.Grays was eventually ticketed with resisting arrest. He was then handcuffed and put in the back of the unmarked police car where he was taken away. It is not a crime for someone to voice outrage after almost being struck by a vehicle   It is not a crime to state that you re angry at someone who almost hit you. That is not a crime,  Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said during a press conference on Tuesday.Adams wants the four police officers involved in the arrest to be investigated. They place handcuffs on an on-duty postal employee delivering the U.S. mail. If they would do that to him in his postal uniform, they would do it to any person of color in that community. When the police arrested Grays, they also left his mail truck unattended   possibly violating several federal procedures. Adams thinks that the police should be punished for any violations of federal procedure that may have happened. I believe there were federal violations. Number one, leaving that truck unsecured. Number, two, interrupting the delivery of mail. There are clear NYPD procedures when you are arresting a federal employee. We don t know if even those basic procedures were followed.

Hollywood Hip to Al Qaeda: ‘And the Oscar for Best Documentary Short goes to…’," Alex Christoforou The DuranIt should come as no surprise that a film celebrating the White Helmets scooped up an Oscar for best short documentary. Might as well hand the Oscar to ISIS leader Ab  Bakr al-Baghdadi.Far from a humanitarian organisation, the White Helmets are an Al Qaeda staffed propaganda group that is embedded with brutal jihadists looking to overthrow the sovereign government of Syria.Watch this CrossTalk episode to learn who the White Helmets represent  Al Jazeera reports Accepting the Academy Award, director Orlando von Einsiedel urged the audience to stand up and call for an end to Syria s six-year civil war, which led to a standing ovation.Von Einsiedel read out a statement from White Helmets founder Raed al-Saleh, in which he thanked the academy and said the group had saved tens of thousands of lives since it was formed in 2014. We are so grateful that this film has highlighted our work to the world. Our organisation is guided by a verse from the Quran: to save one life is to save all of humanity,  Saleh s statement said. We have saved more than 82,000 Syrian lives. I invite anyone here who hears me to work on the side of life to stop the bloodshed in Syria and around the world. Rescue workers in Syria are at risk of being killed in so-called  double tap  air raids that target them as they arrive at the scene of an air strike. The group says that many of its volunteers have been killed.Syrian cinematographer Khaled Khatib who worked on the documentary was unable to attend after being barred from entering the United States, despite being granted a visa.US officials reportedly discovered  derogatory information  about him, according to a document seen by the Associated Press news agency.The film s producer Joanna Natasegara told AP on Sunday that the decision was  sad and confusing. Nothing sad and confusing  about it. The White Helmets are Al Nusra, aka Al Qaeda, aka ISIS.Need more proof? WATCH THIS VIDEO.

#BlackPrivilegedLives: Truth Behind The (Not So) Poor Oppressed Black Mizzou Student Who Went On “Hunger Strike” Over “White Privilege” [Video],"We ll wait for Nancy Pelosi to call this movement exactly what it is an  astro-turf  movement. The  hate cops  and  hate white people  movement is a George Soros funded, Obama, Eric Holder and Al Sharpton inspired movement created to pit  the haves  and the  have nots  against each other. To hell with America and it s great people, this is about something much more important to the Left, it s about a divided nation totally dependent upon the government.No justice no peace! We have nothing to lose but our chains  -Jonathan Butler, son of very successful multi-millionaire parents.Jonathan Butler, a central figure in the protests at the University of Missouri, is an Omaha native and the son of a railroad vice president, the Omaha World-Herald reports.Butler refused food last week in a move to force the university system s president, Timothy M. Wolfe, from office. Wolfe resigned Monday and Butler ended his hunger strike.Jonathan Butler played high-school football at Omaha Central High, where he won a state championship, and earned a bachelor s degree in business administration from Mizzou, the newspaper reports. He is working toward a master s degree in educational leadership and policy.He is a member of a prominent Omaha family. The newspaper says that Butler s father is Eric L. Butler, executive vice president for sales and marketing for the Union Pacific Railroad. His 2014 compensation was $8.4 million, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Via: SLTButler s turn from silent type to activist wasn t a complete surprise to his old football coach, Jay Ball, who remembered how Butler worked hard to bulk himself up in order to make the move from the junior varsity team to varsity. In his senior year, Butler started on a team that won the state title.Ball said Butler wasn t a big guy   standing about 5-foot-9, tops. But Ball practically had to kick Butler out of the weight room because the aspiring player spent so much time there, pushing himself.  I can remember watching him squat,  Ball said.  His eyeballs bulged out. Ball said Butler led by example, not rah-rah bravado.  He was really smart,  Ball said,  a very coachable kid. Ball said Butler s drive, tenacity and effort probably served him well these past weeks.In his senior yearbook, Butler is shown twice: once in a tie for his class portrait and once in a tiny football team photograph. According to teachers and administrators, he was not the kind of student who organized events or served on the student council. Instead, he was a quiet, solid student who paid attention.Now Butler is the public face of a protest that drew national attention and felled two top leaders. Butler and others have said he s not the center   several women at Mizzou plus the school s student body president took more public positions earlier. But his hunger strike, which stretched for eight days, seems to have been the catalyst.Where did this activism come from?Butler did not respond to a World-Herald reporter s requests for interviews. His parents declined to comment. They traveled to Missouri on Monday. A family friend described the family as incredibly humble and low profile.Butler has said in news reports that his paternal grandfather, an attorney helping the poor in New York City, was a big influence. So were his parents: Eric is a Union Pacific executive and Cynthia is a former educator who runs an advocacy program. They founded Joy of Life Ministries in their basement, and it has grown into a church now based at 56th Street and Sorensen Parkway.Butler has said that the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014 and the subsequent protests there marked a turning point for him. He spent time in Ferguson, a two-hour drive from Columbia, lending his voice two summers ago.Here is Butler, the self proclaimed speaking to students.  I am a revolutionary.

 Trump’s Energy Secretary Has An Idea For Stopping Sexual Assault – This Is INSANE,"Who knew that Rick Perry would come up with an idea for stopping sexual assault? He no doubt thinks he s absolutely brilliant because his idea is fossil fuels. Yes, he thinks fossil fuels can help stop the problems with massive rape in developing countries. But while he thinks he s shining a light on an amazingly novel idea, he s really being insanely offensive to all the victims of rape in the world. Here s how he managed to combine fossil fuels with sexual assault: But also from the standpoint of sexual assault, when the lights are on, when you have light that shines, the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts. So from the standpoint of how you really affect people s lives, fossil fuels is going to play a role in that. I happen to think it s going to play a positive role. Well gee, so sorry you were raped but your village doesn t have electricity yet. That totally would have stopped it. Does he not know that they already have ways to light their dwellings and their villages? We won t even ask whether he understands what rape is and why it happens   it s clear he thinks it s only a violent act that happens in darkness.That s not just offensive to rape victims in the developing world, it s offensive to all rape victims everywhere. But Rick Perry hails from the crowd that blames women for sexual assault and harassment. It wouldn t be surprising to find that he thinks keeping lights on will stop the rape gangs in South Africa and elsewhere.There s also the fact that Perry doesn t believe that fossil fuels are responsible for accelerating climate change, so of course he s going to put his ignorance on display like this. To that, we say, go home, Perry. You are disgusting.Featured image via Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images",News,"November 2, 2017"
" Trump Sticks To Racist Birther Conspiracy Theory, Won’t Admit Obama Born In USA","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump refused to admit that his belief and promotion of the racist and inaccurate birther conspiracy theory was wrong. The candidate doubled down on the false idea that has been promoted by conservatives for almost a decade now in an interview with the Washington Post:In the interview, conducted late Wednesday aboard his private plane as it idled on the tarmac here, Trump suggested he is not eager to change his pitch or his positions even as he works to reach out to minority voters, many of whom are deeply offended by his long-refuted suggestion that Obama is not a U.S. citizen. Trump refused to say whether he believes Obama was born in Hawaii. I ll answer that question at the right time. I just don t want to answer it yet,  Trump said.When asked about claims in the media from campaign manager Kellyanne Conway that he is no longer a birther, Trump told the paper,  It s okay. She s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on other things. He added,  I don t talk about it anymore. Trump has been promoting the birther conspiracy since 2011, and has never renounced it in the ensuing 5 years. He is on the verge of 2,000 straight days of supporting the conspiracy.President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. His birth there has been certified at the federal level when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004 and when he was elected President of the United States in November 2008.Despite this, as the first black president in U.S. history, conservatives have consistently pushed the idea that Obama is not a natural-born citizen and instead was born in Kenya, where his father is from. The story is completely false, but has been a running theme in conservative politics.Trump was the most prominent and well-known person pushing the conspiracy theory, and even since running for president, has never renounced nor condemned it.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 15, 2016"
DIRTY POLITICS: HOW OBAMA’S INTEL RULES CHANGES Opened The Door For More Spying On Americans,"As his presidency drew to a close, Barack Obama s top aides routinely reviewed intelligence reports gleaned from the National Security Agency s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad, taking advantage of rules their boss relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, Circa has learned.Dozens of times in 2016, those intelligence reports identified Americans who were directly intercepted talking to foreign sources or were the subject of conversations between two or more monitored foreign figures. Sometimes the Americans  names were officially unmasked; other times they were so specifically described in the reports that their identities were readily discernible. Among those cleared to request and consume unmasked NSA-based intelligence reports about U.S. citizens were Obama s national security adviser Susan Rice, his CIA Director John Brennan and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch.Some intercepted communications from November to January involved Trump transition figures or foreign figures  perceptions of the incoming president and his administration. Intercepts involving congressional figures also have been unmasked occasionally for some time.Read more: Circa",politics,"Mar 29, 2017"
BREAKING: US SUPREME COURT RULES King Obama Overstepped Authority…Executive Amnesty For 5 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS/ Democrat Voters Not Going To Happen,"Don t let the door hit ya B..b..but who will beat up innocent Trump supporters? The assertion of presidential power was remarkable in scale. With the flick of a pen just before Thanksgiving in 2014, President Obama ordered that nearly five million illegal immigrants be allowed to  come out of the shadows  and work legally in the United States.Standing at the same lectern where he had announced the death of Osama bin Laden three years earlier, Mr. Obama insisted in a speech to the nation that his plan for immigrants was a fully legal response to a Republican-controlled Congress that had refused his plea for an overhaul of the nation s immigration laws.But on Thursday, the Supreme Court disagreed. In a 4-to-4 decision, the justices let stand a lower court ruling that Mr. Obama had overstepped his authority. The decision freezes the president s actions for the balance of his term, leaving the future of the program   and millions of undocumented workers   in limbo.Mr. Obama campaigned vowing to win passage of comprehensive immigration legislation in his first year in office, but the Supreme Court defeat will force him to finish his term without securing the major progress he had promised to millions of Latino immigrants living under the threat of deportation.Instead, one of the president s chief immigration legacies will be the years of increased enforcement he ordered at the border with Mexico and in immigrant communities, hoping it would lead to a compromise with Republicans. The aggressive actions of immigration agents and local law enforcement, especially during Mr. Obama s first term, angered many family members separated by raids and deportations.Mr. Obama did earn praise from Hispanics for taking action in 2012 to help the so-called Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as small children. Under the president s program, more than 730,000 of them received documents allowing them to work legally without constant fear that they might be sent home.Hillary Clinton, who embraced the president s executive action programs, has said she would expand them. The court s actions could complicate her ability to do that if she is elected president in the fall.But the successful legal assault on Mr. Obama s actions may also yield some political benefits for Mrs. Clinton and Democrats by helping to motivate and energize Hispanic voters who are angry with the court s decision. Activists have promised to punish Donald J. Trump and other Republicans who opposed the president s actions by registering more Hispanic voters and getting them to vote. Mr. Trump s rhetorical assault on immigrants, especially Mexicans, is also likely to help energize Hispanic activists on behalf of Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic candidates.The court s action comes after nearly eight years of largely futile attempts by the president to make good on his promise.Mr. Obama had resorted to executive actions in 2014 after years of fighting to get Congress to act. In 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration overhaul that the White House said the president could support. But House Republicans blocked any consideration of the legislation, accusing the Senate and Mr. Obama of supporting amnesty for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States.For most of his presidency, even Mr. Obama said he did not have the power to act unilaterally. He repeatedly told Hispanic activists that he could not use the  Dreamers  program as a model to expand similar protections to a much larger pool of illegal immigrants. If we start broadening that, then essentially I ll be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally,  Mr. Obama told Jose Diaz-Balart in an interview in September 2013, after it was clear that House Republicans were blocking the Senate s immigration measure.  So that s not an option.    NYT",politics,"Jun 23, 2016"
 Trump Caught In Huge Lie About His Shady Foundation,"Donald Trump is still using his Twitter account to push big, ridiculous lies about his troubled personal foundation, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Despite his success in the presidential election, it seems Trump just can t let go of the issue since it s still generating negative headlines for him.In a tweet Trump claimed that  100% of money  donated to the foundation  goes to wonderful charities,  but as the Huffington Post reports, that is a total lie about how the foundation has operated over the years of its existence.The Donald J. Trump Foundation, established in 1987, admitted to the Internal Revenue Service just last year that it engaged in  self-dealing,  a prohibited practice in which a nonprofit leader uses an organization s money to benefit his or her own interests.According to a Washington Post report earlier this month, the foundation s 2015 tax filings confirmed it had transferred income or assets to a  disqualified person  that year (in this case, a  disqualified person  could be Trump himself or a member of his family or business) and had engaged in similar practices in previous years.While the media fixated on the  optics  and right-wing innuendo about the Clinton Foundation (much of that smear financed by the head of Breitbart by the way), Trump s foundation escaped much of the same scrutiny despite its admittedly illegal behavior.Additionally, the Trump Foundation donated money to a political group associated with Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, who dropped a probe of Trump University at the same time. The IRS fined the foundation over that behavior.He also used the foundation as a slush fund to settle multiple lawsuits that had been personally filed against him, instead of using his own bank accounts to do so. This behavior has continued to cast suspicion on Trump s claim that he is a billionaire, and his refusal to release his taxes hasn t helped alleviate those thoughts.Featured image via Flickr",News,"December 27, 2016"
" Ex-Subway Spokesman And Pedophile Jared Fogle Attacked, Beaten In Prison","Jared Fogle, the man who lost a ton of weight eating sandwiches from  Eat Fresh  chain Subway and was later a celebrated spokesman for them, suffered one of the most spectacular falls from grace in recent history. Fogle went from being Subway s favorite face to being the face of a sordid scandal in 0.2 seconds when he was investigated, and later pled guity to, charges of child pornography and child molestation.Well, Fogle s troubles are far from over. You see, everyone hates people who victimize children  even other criminals. One such criminal let Fogle know this, too, by giving him what some would say he had coming to him in the rec yard of the prison facility in which they are both housed. Fogle was unlucky enough to cross paths at Englewood FCI in Littleton, Colorado, with fellow inmate Steven Nigg, on January 29. Nigg reportedly has big issues with child molesters, and made sure that Fogle got good and roughed up. The former celebrity spokesman suffered a few punches to his nose that left him bloodied, as well as with a scratched up neck. Nigg s family says that Fogle is, quote,  lucky to be alive.  According to nephew Jimmy Nigg, Jr: My uncle was in a position to kill him. No one was there. He got him down, then walked away. (My uncle s) not a violent guy. He doesn t have a violent history. He s sending a message (to pedophiles) is what he s doing. A guy walks in with all this money and celebrity and instead of flying under the radar, he s going into the yard, walking around with big guys, saying no one can mess with me, flashing his money around. It has been reported that Fogle, instead of doing like most imprisoned pedophiles and keeping his head down and his mouth shut, has been paying other inmates off to protect him. Doesn t look like his cash is getting him much leverage, though, if this happened.Now, no one condones violence, but, let s face it, Fogle is scum. Oh   and the icing on the cake here? It seems that without his steady diet of healthy Subway sandwiches, Fogle has gained 30 lbs in the three months he has spent behind bars.Good riddance, Jared.

"PROOF That Obama Interfered TWICE In Foreign Elections, Including Time He Used U.S. TAXPAYER MONEY To Defeat Conservative Israeli Leader [VIDEO]","President Barack Obama recently said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin to  knock it off  back in September. Obama s alleged demand was a result of the supposed  hacking  of the computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), in what has been presented as an attempt by the Russians to influence the outcome of the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.This alleged effort by the Russians was even cited as a reason to block Trump s election in the Electoral College. Some presidential electors even asked for an intelligence briefing before they cast their votes, so they would know exactly what Putin s government did. Of course, almost all those asking for the briefing were Democrat electors already voting for Trump s Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, so it could be dismissed as just a political ploy.But, if the Russians did covertly attempt to alter the outcome of the presidential election, it would seem somewhat hypocritical of the U.S. government to take umbrage. After all, the United States, under several presidents both Democrat and Republican, has repeatedly interfered in foreign elections, both covertly and overtly, multiple times in the past several decades.Most recently, President Obama told British voters that they better not vote for Brexit   the public vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (EU)   or they would find themselves  at the back of the queue [line]  in getting any sort of trade deal with the United States. Of course, with Obama leaving office on January 20, he would not be making any trade deals with anyone much longer anyway.Here is the video of Barack Obama attempting to influence the Brexit vote by threatening to put them at the back of the que:Obama went on to say,  I think this [membership in the EU] makes you guys bigger players,  at a joint press conference with then-British Prime Minister David Cameron, a staunch supporter of remaining in the EU. In the end, the British did not take Obama s  advice,  and opted to leave the EU.It was not the first time that the Obama administration attempted to determine the outcome of a foreign election. In the last Israeli election, the Obama State Department funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to the opposition of Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that the State Department and a group called One Voice coordinated political activities   including the building of a voter database, the training of activists, and the hiring of a political consulting firm tied to President Obama himself.Watch here:Yet, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has charged that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election by releasing e-mails damaging to the Clinton campaign effort. But why is it acceptable for the United States government to interfere in another nation s election campaign efforts, but not acceptable for other countries   including Russia   to (allegedly) interfere in U.S. elections?The Brexit vote and Israeli election are not the only times this has happened. Don Levin of Carnegie Mellon University has documented 81 times the United States has attempted to influence presidential elections in other countries between 1946 and 2000. And then, of course, there are the military coups backed by the United States and the regime changes imposed by military actions. In his study, Levin described  intervention  as including funding of the election campaigns of selected political parties, the dissemination of political propaganda, training of local activists in political techniques, and public comments by high-ranking U.S. officials, favoring or disfavoring one side or the other. He also included public threats to withdraw foreign aid, or even promises to provide it if one side were to be elected.For entire story: The American",politics,"Jun 8, 2017"
" Trump Just Got A Secret Intel Briefing From A Foreign Power, And It’s Not Who You Think","While Trump says he s  like, a smart person,  and so doesn t need the President s daily intelligence briefings, he s taking security and intelligence briefings from spy agencies from other countries. In this case, he actually got a secret briefing from one of Israel s spy chiefs, Yossi Cohen, Director of the Mossad. The Mossad is Israel s top intelligence agency, analogous to the CIA in many ways, and none other than Benjamin Netanyahu organized this secret meeting with Trump and his people.As if that wasn t suspicious enough, the meeting included discussions of the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel claims is a clear and present threat to its existence; along with discussions of Syria s civil war and terrorism.This is all stuff he could and should be getting from our own intelligence officials, but he s alienated our intelligence community twice now   first by shunning briefings, and second by insulting the CIA after they said they were confident that Russia hacked our election to help Trump win.It s quite clear that he looks upon our intelligence community with severe disdain. That s problematic, because if he s planning on getting a lot of intelligence this way, then it s also clear that he doesn t realize these foreign envoys don t have our best interests at heart. They have their own, and they will take advantage of him this way if they can.When it comes to the Russian hacking scandal, Trump is getting most of his intel from military generals who probably don t have the complex knowledge of digital espionage that Trump needs to be able to put a solid cybersecurity plan forward. So it wouldn t be surprising to find that he s getting more intelligence briefings from more sources, like this secret one from the Mossad.(What s worse is wondering what role Trump s ego played here. It wouldn t be surprising to find out that Trump took that meeting more because it made him feel special, and less because it was something he truly believes in.)For reference, the Mossad secretly helped supply Iran with weapons in their war against Iraq as part of the Iran-Contra Affair that embroiled President Reagan s administration in a deep scandal. Now they re reaching out to our president-elect not just for help with Iran and Syria, but also for help with Palestine. As Netanyahu has said in the past, Israel must occupy all the land for the foreseeable future. They see this as essential to their security (it s actually essential to their expansion, but they d never say that).Israel also wants Trump to stand against Obama on a U.N. resolution that Israel and its supporters see as advocating pro-Palestinian rights.The horror.It s just terrible when someone wants equal rights   a  problem  with which we here in the U.S. have some experience. And Obama is expected to speak out in support of this resolution and of restarting peace talks between Israel and Palestine.Trump has tapped his own bankruptcy lawyer, David Friedman, as the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Friedman a hardliner who doesn t believe in a two-state solution and wants to declare Israel s settlements in the West Bank legal. No wonder Israel sent a secret envoy to meet with Trump.Regardless, Trump needs to get his intelligence briefings on these subjects from U.S. intelligence officials, because he needs to see these things from our point of view. Israel isn t thinking about us, they re thinking about themselves, and could seriously undermine any efforts we re making in the Middle East. This meeting was for them, not for us. If this is how Trump plans on getting intelligence, then we re in a lot of trouble.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,"December 18, 2016"
BREAKING STORY! TRUE EVIL EXPOSED: [Video] PLANNED PARENTHOOD DIRECTOR Caught On Video Selling Aborted Baby Parts,"B b but I thought they said they re just trying to provide quality  health care  for women .An undercover video recorded by the non-profit organization, Center for Medical Progress, shows Planned Parenthood Federation Senior Director of Medical Services, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, discussing their fetal parts business.Nucatola is seen in the video having lunch with actors posing as buyers who are interested in purchasing the body parts of babies who have been aborted. The Planned Parenthood senior staffer notes how abortion procedures are modified to ensure that requested body parts can be collected. She says: We ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I m not gonna crush that part, I m gonna basically crush below, I m gonna crush above, and I m gonna see if I can get it all intact. Nucatola also describes how Planned Parenthood abortionists move the preborn child into a breech delivery position so that the body can be preserved. This account is an almost exact medical description of partial-birth abortions which are illegal in the United States. In the video, Nucatola describes the procedure: I d say a lot of people want liver. And for that reason, most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance, so they ll know where they re putting their forceps. The kind of rate-limiting step of the procedure is calvarium. Calvarium the head is basically the biggest part.  We ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I m not gonna crush that part, I m gonna basically crush below, I m gonna crush above, and I m gonna see if I can get it all intact. And with the calvarium, in general, some people will actually try to change the presentation so that it s not vertex.  So if you do it starting from the breech presentation, there s dilation that happens as the case goes on, and often, the last step,you can evacuate an intact calvarium at the end. Planned Parenthood, though, appears to be concerned internally about the legality of their own behavior, as Nucatola notes how,  At the national office, we have a Litigation and Law Department which just really doesn t want us to be the middle people for this issue right now. U.S. federal law states that,  It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce. Live Action President Lila Rose has been active for years in exposing wrongdoing at Planned Parenthood through undercover investigations. She responded to the disturbing investigative video, saying:This investigation by the Center for Medical Progress reveals the unimaginable horror that is Planned Parenthood. The exploitation of human life, the cover-up, and the black market profiteering by America s largest abortion chain is not only egregious and heartbreaking, but exposes how the abortion giant is corrupt to the core   from the CEO, Cecile Richards, down to the local clinic. As Live Action has investigated through the years, Planned Parenthood s barbaric practices reveal their contempt for rule of law and human life. This latest expose of Planned Parenthood s trafficking of baby parts for profit should be the final nail in the coffin for the abortion giant. Congress must take immediate action to stop all taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and end the bankrolling of this horrific human rights abuser.Via: LiveActionNews",left-news,"Jul 14, 2015"
 WHOA: Clinton Just Effectively Sh*tcanned Debbie Wasserman-Schultz,"If you re dissatisfied with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz as the head of the DNC, Hillary Clinton has some good news for you. While one cannot simply remove the DNC Chairwoman from her position, and while she will retain her title, Wasserman-Schultz has been stripped of most of her power. CNN reports:Hillary Clinton s campaign is taking the reins of the Democratic National Committee, installing a new top official on Thursday to oversee the party s day-to-day operations through the general election.Brandon Davis, national political director for the Service Employees International Union, will become the general election chief of staff for the Democratic Party. His selection formalizes the coordination of the Clinton campaign and the committee, a stark contrast to Donald Trump who is currently at odds with his party.Now, this sort of thing is rather common   but it is expected to alleviate some of Democrats  concerns about Wasserman-Schultz s rather lackluster leadership abilities. This is in fact what happens,  former Democratic Party chairman, Howard Dean, told CNN.  Debbie will still have the title, but somebody else will be the effective operator of the DNC. It s Hillary s pick.  And, of course, Hillary could have picked anyone she wanted (including Wasserman-Schultz). But, of course, she didn t, perhaps realizing that the Chairwoman is not the right fit for this or many other jobs. We basically just turned it over to him and I left the building to him. He ran the DNC,  Dean said, explaining how he transitioned to simply raising money for Barack Obama after his campaign took over the party.  It was very clear I wasn t going to be running the DNC as soon as there was a nominee. It has long been suspected that DWS was working in cahoots with the Clinton campaign. While it is true that the Democratic nominee has benefited from the party leader s numerous blunders   including a terrible debate schedule that kept the party out of the public eye   it seems that it was just incompetence that appeared to be assistance. Or, if Debbie was providing assistance in hopes of a reward, Clinton did not return the favor. In any case, the Democratic Party is stronger with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz sidelined.This decision comes on the heels of a meeting between Clitnon and Bernie Sanders, who has long called for new leadership in the DNC. Sen. Sanders and Secretary Clinton met in Washington on Tuesday evening and had a positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation,  said Michael Briggs, Sanders  spokesman, in a statement following the meeting.  Sanders congratulated Secretary Clinton on the campaign she has run and said he appreciated her strong commitment to stopping Trump in the general election. It is unknown how or if Sanders influenced Clinton s decision to strip Wasserman-Schultz of power. We have a lot of work to do over the next five months to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president,  Clinton campaign manager, Robby Mook, said while introducing Davis to the party s staff.  With so much at stake in this election, we could not ask for a better partner in that mission than the team here. Now, we just need an election to make this  firing  permanent.Featured image via Getty Images/Andrew Burton",News,"June 16, 2016"
 Trump Declares War On NFL In Early Morning Twitter MELTDOWN,"Donald Trump is now obsessed with attacking the NFL.On Friday night, Trump demanded that NFL team owners fire any player who kneels during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and called NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick a  son of a bitch.

Kneeling during the national anthem is a protest against racial injustice, and so far, it has been working. Attention has been brought to the issue. But Trump wants owners to start firing players who kneel or force them to stand, which would likely see a bunch of lawsuits filed against the NFL.Refusing to stand during the national anthem is protected as free speech and expression by the Constitution. It would be like forcing kids to stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance in school, which is what Trump will probably do next after he gets humiliated by the NFL.The NFL can do that by making sure Colin Kaepernick gets signed by a team. And every NFL player should kneel during the anthem in solidarity with their fellow teammates. Their teammates are under attack by Donald Trump now. It s time to kneel together, not just to protest racism, but to protest him as well. Because Trump is the biggest racist of them all.Featured Image: David Becker / Stringer via Getty",News,"September 24, 2017"
"WHOA! FIRST LADY MELANIA Makes Classy, Yet Blistering Response To Kathy Griffin’s ISIS Inspired Photo Of Decapitated President Trump","Social media erupted yesterday when outspoken comedian Kathy Griffin, posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields where she held a bloodied, decapitated mask of President Trump.Today, Melania Trump questioned Kathy Griffin s mental health in a blistering statement after she posted a photo of her holding a bloodied, decapitated version of President Trump s head.The video posted on Twitter of Griffin holding the decapitated head of President Trump has since been removed. As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,  the first lady said in a statement Wednesday.

Trump s tweet also reminded Griffin that he has an 11-year old son who has the ability to see her disgusting depiction of his father s bloodied, decapitated head:Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself.

FIRST PERSON TO BE KILLED By Terrorist In Speeding Truck Was Activist Who Helped Refugees Like The One Who Killed Her Stay In Sweden,"A Belgian psychologist and mother-of-one who worked with asylum seekers facing deportation has been named as the latest victim of Friday s jihadi atrocity in Stockholm.Males Dereymaeker, 31, was waiting for friends from work on the corner of Drottninggatan and Olof Palmes gata when the terrorist struck.She was the first victim to be hit by the speeding lorry and died instantly at the scene.It took forensic experts two days to identify her mangled body from DNA samples.Ms Dereymaeker, who was from the small town of Lembeek near Brussels and had an 18-month-old toddler, worked with illegal immigrants facing deportation like her killer, Rakhmat Akilov.Today, as Sweden held a minute s silence for the victims, politicians demanded greater powers to monitor failed asylum seekers.Activists even managed to hijack memorials for the victims with politically correct messages like the sign seen below that reads,  Terrorism Isn t [sic] A Religion :The tough new measures are being demanded after it was revealed the alleged killer Rakhmat Akilove, 39, had been told to leave Sweden in December. He was given four weeks to leave, but disappeared from his last known address.The fanatic, who killed four in Friday s carnage, told the Swedish Migration Board that he had been arrested during a demonstration and was subsequently tortured by police for nine days.However, a medical examination showed that torture had not taken place.Investigators concluded that his identity could not be confirmed as he had used several aliases when applying for asylum.A court also questioned his version of events, saying that his description of conditions in prison was too vague.

NOT KIDDING: DEMOCRATS Are Calling For Obama To Be Hillary’s Running Mate…But Is That Legal?,"Not that the word  legal  means anything to either one of them Because Hillary Clinton is white and no longer young, a strain of political thought holds that she might lack Barack Obama s inherent appeal to new and minority voters and thus that she won t be able to ride the Democratic party s demographic advantages to easy victory in 2016.Writing for the Washington Examiner, Philip Klein ably sketches the nightmare scenario for liberals.  If Hillary s performance among black voters retreats to more typical Democratic levels,  he writes,  it will hinder her efforts in swing states such as Ohio and Florida, where Democrats need to rack up huge margins in urban areas to make up for their weaknesses in other parts of the states.   It s questionable that young voters will flock to vote at historically high levels for a 69-year-old white woman who has been a national political figure since before many of them were born. The nightmare for conservatives is a complementary scenario in which Clinton holds the Obama coalition together without issue and simultaneously increases Democratic margins among women and whites. In that world, she defeats her opponent by greater margins than Obama defeated John McCain and Mitt Romney. But there s no reason to assume that outcome is any more likely than the one Klein alluded to. And there s also no reason Democrats should tinker with a winning formula. If Clinton can turn out Obama s voters, she will win.The challenge, then, is to make sure Clinton s age and ethnicity don t discourage Obama s youthful, diverse supporters from turning out in November 2016. Fortunately, there s an easy way to make sure that doesn t happen. Clinton simply has to select Barack Obama as her running mate.LOL, you might be thinking. Obama can t be the vice president. That would place him at the top of the line of succession, and the Constitution limits him to two terms. Clinton would end up in court before she ended up in the White House if she pulled something like that.I ll grant that if Democrats nominate Barack Obama to be their vice presidential candidate next year, it would be somewhat controversial. But here Democrats can borrow tactically from the literal-minded conservatives who have seized on syntactic oddities to unravel Obama s domestic agenda. As a purely textual matter, the Constitution merely prohibits Obama from being elected to a third term. It doesn t necessarily prohibit him from actually being president again, should Hillary Clinton no longer be able to serve. And were he on the ticket, Clinton s potential liabilities with Obama loyalists would disappear.As hot takes go, this one is significantly more piping than, say, the idea that Al Gore should challenge Hillary for the nomination. My guru for this argument is Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, though others have examined the issue, as well.There are three sections of the Constitution that prescribe limits on who can be president and vice president: Article II, the Twelfth Amendment and the Twenty-Second Amendment. While the former two limit who is  eligible  to serve natural born citizens, 35 or older the Twenty-Second Amendment begins  No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. Whether its adopters intended it or not, the plain language of the Twenty-Second amendment doesn t prohibit a former two-term president from succeeding a sitting president and serving out the remainder of her term. It merely prohibits him from running for a third. By using the term  elected  instead of  eligible,  its authors created a loophole large enough for a Clinton-Obama ticket to coast to victory through. Via: New Republic ",politics,"May 25, 2016"

 Bernie Sanders’ Takedown Of Donald Trump’s ‘Greatness’ Is Absolutely Hysterical (VIDEO),"Senator Bernie Sanders had the crowd roaring with laughter during a campaign rally in Nevada on Sunday as he mocked a certain GOPer mercilessly.The victim of Sanders  flawless sense of humor was none other than Republican front runner Donald Trump, who has been known to boast about how great he is at every endeavor he s ever tried his hand at. Not a day goes by that Trump isn t shoving his ego down the throats of Americans, with ridiculous claims that he will be the  greatest jobs president  or  the best thing that ever happened to women. Sanders used Trump s inflated sense of self against him, turning the business mogul into some comic relief for his supporters.As soon as Sanders mentioned Trump s name, the audience was booing the GOP candidate despite Sanders  attempts to calm them down. But he knows just how to lift the mood and the entire audience was soon laughing as Sanders said, We know that Donald Trump is the greatest everything in the world. There is nothing that this man is not  the greatest  at. And one of his major scientific contributions in recent years has been to proclaim that climate change is a hoax. Now, for Republican candidates, this is not an unusual idea, but [Trump] added something to it, being the brilliant scientist that he is: That this hoax was created by the Chinese! This made Sanders  supporters giggle, as he noted how strange it was that Trump didn t blame climate change on immigrants or Muslims   two minorities that Trump loves to blame for basically anything. You can watch Sanders  hilarious takedown of the GOPer below:Obviously, Trump is nothing close to a scientist, but that doesn t stop him from blabbering on about his extensive  knowledge  of the subject. Even though Trump later tried to distance himself from the tweets where he d said China was responsible for climate change, there are plenty other examples that show Trump doesn t know a damn thing about the subject   after all, he d once said that climate change was a hoax because of extreme winter weather!Trump is a complete idiot, and perhaps one of the things he s really the greatest at is showing just how ridiculous he and his fellow conservatives are.

And no, Bundy s mother was not off limits. With regards to her helping spread the word about needed supplies, Colbert said: She would deliver the items herself, but the clubhouse sign clearly says,  No girls allowed. Colbert then went on to mock the militants  requests for things like shampoo and conditioner, saying: It s one thing to face off against the jackbooted thugs of the tyrannical government, (but) it s another to have to fight the frizzies. You want hair to bounce and behave. They really gave the Late Show host plenty of material when they begged for French Vanilla coffee creamer and throw rugs.

MAJOR DONATIONS TO CLINTON FOUNDATION From Country Who Tortures Dissidents And Provided Lavish Digs For Bill and Chelsea During CGI Conference,"What s a million dollars between friends? To hell with human rights violations Hillary s got a campaign to win!A major Clinton Foundation donor regularly arrests dissidents and brutally tortures them to extract confessions, according to a new report from Amnesty International.The New York Times reports that despite promises of reform, the Moroccan government continues to use  violent interrogation tactics  to  crush dissent. Moroccan King Mohammed VI recently hosted Bill and Chelsea Clinton at a Clinton Global Initiative conference in Marrakech, where guests were  chauffeured across the city to an opulent 56-room palace that boasts a private collection of Arabian horses, overlooks the snow-capped Atlas Mountains and serves a fine-dining menu of  biolight  cuisine,  according to the Washington Post.    During the conference Bill cited  Morocco s longstanding friendship to my family,  and thanked the king, who pledged as much as $500,000 toward the construction of the Clinton Library, as well as the OCP Corporation, a government-owned phosphate mining company that has donated at least $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. In interviews with POLITICO, former OCP miners described witnessing verbal and physical abuse doled out by the government against member of a minority advocating for independence in Western Sahara.Amnesty International secretary general Salil Shetty blasted the Moroccan government in a statement, saying:  Morocco s leaders portray the image of a liberal, human-rights-friendly country. But as long as the threat of torture hangs over detention and dissent that image will just be a mirage. According to the report, Moroccan dissidents are repeatedly subjected to  beatings, stress positions, asphyxiation, simulated drowning, psychological and sexual violence,  as a means of securing confessions for alleged crimes against the state. One tactic, known as the  roast chicken,  involves  suspending detainees from an iron bar by their wrists and knees. It is not known whether Bill Clinton met with any Moroccan detainees while hobnobbing at the Clinton Foundation event, which featured a  lavish palm-tree-lined golf resort with a cocktail reception featuring Moroccan hors d oeuvres and a saxophonist serenading about 50 donors.

Spicer, a Patriots fan, declined the offer. Mild laughs were had. Gronkowski then disappeared, presumably to cause more mischief in other parts of the building.It s not surprising that the tight end performed a bit like this. That he was wearing a shirt while doing it was a bit of a shock.Right after this video was posted Facebook comments were brutal about how unprofessional it was to have this guy pop into the briefing.

When he said he knows 3 people named  Hilary Rosen.  After Obama adviser Hilary Rosen said Ann Romney hadn t worked a day in her life, it was discovered Rosen had visited the White House numerous times. When questioned on it, Carney claimed he knew 3 separate women named  Hilary Rosen. 2. That one time he stumbled when asked why the Obama Administration withheld a crucial Benghazi email.3. That day when he called a reporter s repeated questions on Kathleen Sebelius  lame. 4. That time he admitted White House staff knew of the IRS scandal and didn t tell Obama.5. That time he admitted that the Obama Budget wouldn t balance.6. That moment when he finally admitted Obama s  Keep Your Plan  promise wasn t true.Shouldn t the liberal snowflakes be outraged at what Jay Carney did? ",Government News,"Apr 19, 2017"
 Sheriff Joe Arpaio Is FINALLY Facing Criminal Prosecution,"After 20 years of corruption, millions of dollars wasted in ethics charges, and a stain on the integrity of law enforcement, Sheriff Joe Arpaio will finally be facing criminal prosecution.After being found guilty in civil court for being in contempt of court, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow, a Republican appointee, recommended that prosecutors bring forth criminal charges against Arpaio, second-in-command Gerard Sheridan, and Maricopa County Sheriff s Office Captain Steve Bailey. Also recommended for prosecution is Arpaio s attorney, Michele Iafrate.Two months ago, Arpaio, Sheridan, Bailey and Iafrate were found guilty in civil court of violating court orders to halt a process used by the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office that included elements of racial profiling. Not only did the Office, at the behest of Arpaio, intentionally disregard the orders, those named in the civil suit lied about doing so, even while under oath.In his order, Snow, who wrote 22 times that the defendants had  intentionally  broke the law and court order, said:Criminal contempt serves to vindicate the Court s authority by punishing the intentional disregard for that authority.In other words: Arpaio and his thugs aren t above the law.Congratulations, Republicans, while you all were screaming  lock her up  at the RNC, one of your keynote speakers, Mr. Arpaio himself, is being dragged into court to face criminal charges.Arpaio s legal team said they of course would be appealing the decision in civil court and challenging the recommendation for criminal charges.Even with Trump on the ticket, Arpaio is in the fight of his life to retain his seat as Sheriff of Maricopa County. After seeing his support shrink in every election since his first one   1994   Arpaio faces his toughest re-election bid yet, with multiple polls showing Democratic challenger Paul Penzone ahead in the race, something that has never happened to Arpaio (and similarly with John McCain in his race against Ann Kirkpatrick).If all goes according to plan, the voters will kick Arpaio out of office and a criminal court will finally find him guilty of abusing his power.

RINO MITCH McCONNELL Praises Hillary Day After Benghazi Hearing…Says He Could Work With Her As President,"Is there a law against waterboarding Republican Senators who continue to be re-elected even though it s pretty clear they should be running on the Democrat ticket Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) praised former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday   the day after the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report.  She s an intelligent and capable person, no question about it,  McConnell told Time Warner Cable News, adding that he had worked well with her in the Senate and would be able to work with her as president.The Benghazi report details a pattern of incompetence, negligence, and dishonesty by Clinton and her associates. She failed to provide adequate security for U.S. diplomats in Benghazi; failed to take action to save U.S. personnel under attack on Sep. 11, 2012; and then falsely blamed an anti-Islamic YouTube video for inciting a protest that supposedly led to the attack.In addition, the Benghazi investigation uncovered the existence of Clinton s private email server, which violated State Department policies and may also have broken laws regarding the handling of classified information. Clinton seems to have used the server to evade Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, possibly in connection with fundraising for her family s private foundation while in office, including solicitations from foreign donors and governments. She has misled the public repeatedly about the email server, claiming falsely that she did not share classified information and that she had turned over all work-related emails to the government.Yet McConnell did not rule Clinton out. Instead, he said her presumptive Republican opponent, Donald Trump, had not yet proven himself qualified:Sen. Mitch McConnell:  Trump clearly needs to change, in my opinion, to win the general election. What I ve said to him both publicly and privately:  You re a great entertainer. You turn on audiences. You re good before a crowd. You have a lot of Twitter followers. That worked fine for you in the primaries. But now that you are in the general, people are looking for a level of seriousness that is typically conveyed by having a prepared text and Teleprompter and staying on message.  So my hope is that he is beginning to pivot and become what I would call a more serious and credible candidate for the highest office in the land. Geoff Bennett:  At the moment, though, I hear you saying he does not meet that threshold of credibility? McConnell:  He s getting closer. Getting closer. Via: Breitbart ",politics,"Jun 30, 2016"
JUST IN: Flynn to Plead Guilty to Lying to the FBI,"The broader story in this entire Russia witch hunt is if the one count on Flynn announced today is a plea deal. Flynn is being charged with only one count so this raises red flags There has been talk that Flynn would do what he could to protect his son who is also involved in this witch hunt The crime is not the substance but the cover-up of conversations Flynn had with the Russian ambassador. This is exactly what President Trump fired Flynn for Fox News is reporting:Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has been charged in the special counsel s Russia investigation with making false statements to the FBI and is expected to plead guilty at a hearing Friday morning.Special Counsel Robert Mueller s office released a one-count charging document ahead of the hearing.ABC News is reporting that this is a plea deal and that Flynn will assist in the witch hunt:Flynn s plea signals the former top adviser to Trump is now cooperating with the team of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. A brief statement released by Mueller s team Friday morning does not say what information Flynn has provided the government as part of this deal, but sources familiar with the agreement told ABC News Friday he has made a decision to assist investigators.THE DOCUMENT ACCUSING FLYNN:The document accusing Flynn of making false statements pertains to his interactions with Russian officials in late December   specifically discussions about sanctions and other matters.According to the document, those statements were that: On or about Dec 29, 2016, FLYNN did not ask the Government of Russia s Ambassador to the United States ( Russian Ambassador ) to refrain from escalating situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day; and FLYNN did not recall the Russian Ambassador subsequently telling him that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request; and   On or about December 22, 2016, FLYNN did not ask the Russian Ambassador to delay the vote on or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution; and  that the Russian Ambassador subsequently never described to FLYNN Russia  response to his request.

 Scumbag Gets ONLY 10 Days In Jail For Trying To Murder A Woman When She Refused To Have Sex With Him,"These kinds of slaps on the wrist should get judges fired. Period.Wesley Dylan Marshall is probably only going to serve 75 percent of a ridiculous 10 day jail sentence for what he did to a 19-year-old woman this past July.During a stay at the Church Hill Motel with the woman and another man, Marshall became angry and assaulted the woman by literally throwing her off the side of a balcony two stories high because she consented to having sex with the other man and not him in celebration of her birthday.According to the Kingsport Times-News,Aside from the jail time and anger management classes, Marshall was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days of probation, ordered to serve 96 hours of community service, issued fines and fees totaling $1,237 and ordered to have no contact with the victim.It all adds up to yet another light sentence for a white guy who committed violence against a woman, proving once again that the judicial system and the law does not go far enough to protect women from assholes like Marshall.Judges across the country have disgraced themselves by sentencing rapists and abusers to light sentences.In June, Judge Aaron Persky sentenced rapist Brock Turner to only six months in jail, igniting a firestorm of criticism.In August, Colorado Judge Patrick Butler gave a rapist ZERO prison time.A Massachusetts judge did the same thing during the same month and even gave the perpetrator permission to serve his probation in another state so he can attend college.And a Montana judge is facing impeachment for sentencing a man to just 60 days in jail for raping his own daughter.This latest sentencing in Tennessee is just adding to the pattern.Clearly, there are far too many judges in this country who have a frat boy attitude about the way white guys treat women and it s only getting worse.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"October 24, 2016"
 Ted Cruz Cries ‘Unprecedented Persecution’ Because Gay People Can Get Married (AUDIO),"Right-wing Christians are always talking about how LGBT people having equal protections under the law will mean the end of Christianity. Well, the Supreme Court s ruling Obegefell v. Hodges, which made marriage equality legal nationwide was the worst fears of bigots everywhere becoming a reality   but not because of any actual anti   Christian elements to the ruling. The ruling simply says that anyone and everyone can marry whatever consenting adult they like. However, many bigoted Christians see the ability of anyone to do anything they don t like is persecution. On that list of morons who think that way is religious conservative and presidential candidate Ted Cruz.Cruz sat down to speak with right-wing radio host Janet Mefford on Thursday, and of course the conversation turned to his bigoted views on LGBT people. First, he bragged about being endorsed by hate groups such as the Family Research Council and The National Organization for marriage. Then, he went on along rant about how marriage equality was  illegitimate,  and how the Obergefell ruling was nothing short of disastrous Here is the quote (emphasis mine): I believe that decision was fundamentally illegitimate, it was lawless, it was unconstitutional and it will not stand. And I would note, that is precisely why Dr. James Dobson has endorsed me in this campaign, it is why Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council has endorsed me in this campaign, it s why the National Organization on Marriage [sic] has endorsed me on this campaign and has said it cannot support Donald Trump or Marco Rubio because if we re not willing to defend marriage, we are giving up the foundational building blocks of the family, we re giving up the Judeo-Christian values that built this great nation. And that is where you are dead wrong, Senator Cruz. This nation was not built upon Christianity. In fact, our Founding Fathers put explicit walls into our founding documents to ensure a complete separation between church and state. If you do not know that basic fact of our history and of our laws, then you have no business being in any public office, much less the presidency.This is what makes Cruz so dangerous. He is determined to turn America in a giant church via the law should he make it to the White House. That is why it is so important to make sure you VOTE BLUE in November 2016.Listen to the audio below, via Right Wing Watch:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247707760  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"February 18, 2016"
BUSTED! Main Political “Fact” Checker For SNOPES Is FINALLY EXPOSED As Liberal Hack,"Wait until you read this woman s biography and past quotes about conservatives! Popular myth-busting website Snopes originally gained recognition for being the go-to site for disproving outlandish urban legends -such as the presence of UFOs in Haiti or the existence of human-animal hybrids in the Amazon jungle.Recently, however, the site has tried to pose as a political fact-checker. But Snopes   fact-checking  looks more like playing defense for prominent Democrats like Hillary Clinton and it s political  fact-checker  describes herself as a liberal and has called Republicans  regressive  and afraid of  female agency. Snopes  main political fact-checker is a writer named Kim Lacapria. Before writing for Snopes, Lacapria wrote for Inquisitr, a blog that   oddly enough   is known for publishing fake quotes and even downright hoaxes as much as anything else.While at Inquisitr, the future  fact-checker  consistently displayed clear partisanship.She described herself as  openly left-leaning  and a liberal. She trashed the Tea Party as  teahadists.  She called Bill Clinton  one of our greatest  presidents. She claimed that conservatives only criticized Lena Dunham s comparison of voting to sex because they  fear female agency. She once wrote:  Like many GOP ideas about the poor, the panic about using food stamps for alcohol, pornography or guns seems to have been cut from whole cloth or more likely, the ideas many have about the fantasy of poverty.  (A simple fact-check would show that food stamp fraud does occur and costs taxpayers tens of millions.)Lacapria even accused the Bush administration of being  at least guilty of criminal negligience  in the September 11 attacks. (The future  fact-checker  offered no evidence to support her accusation.)Her columns apparently failed to impress her readership, oftentimes failing to get more than 10-20 shares.After blogging the Inquisitr, Lacapria joined Snopes, where she regularly plays defense for her fellow liberals.She wrote a  fact check  article about Jimmy Carter s unilateral ban of Iranian nationals from entering the country that looks more like an opinion column arguing against Donald Trump s proposed Muslim ban.Similarly, Lacapria   in another  fact check  article   argued Hillary Clinton hadn t included Benghazi at all in her infamous  we didn t lose a single person in Libya  gaffe. Lacapria claimed Clinton only meant to refer to the 2011 invasion of Libya (but not the 2012 Benghazi attack) but offered little fact-based evidence to support her claim.After the Orlando terror attack, Lacapria claimed that just because Omar Mateen was a registered Democrat with an active voter registration status didn t mean he was actually a Democrat. Her  fact check  argued that he might  have chosen a random political affiliation when he initially registered. Lacapria even tried to contradict the former Facebook workers who admitted that Facebook regularly censors conservative news, dismissing the news as  rumors. In that  fact check  article, Lacapria argued that  Facebook Trending s blacklisting of  junk topics  was not only not a scandalous development, but to be expected following the social network s crackdown on fake news sites.  The opinion-heavy article was mockingly titled: The Algorithm Is Gonna Get You.Lacapria again played defense for Clinton in a fact check article when she claimed:  Outrage over an expensive Armani jacket worn by Hillary Clinton was peppered with inaccurate details. One of the  inaccurate details  cited by Lacapria was that,  The cost of men s suits worn by fellow politicians didn t appear in the article for contrast.  She also argued the speech Clinton gave while wearing the $12,495 jacket, which discussed  raising wages and reducing inequality,  wasn t actually about income inequality.Read more: Daily Caller",left-news,"Jun 18, 2016"

 WATCH: Anti-LGBT Activist Gets Destroyed When He Can’t Answer Which Bathroom Trans Women Should Use,"The director of the Anti-LGBT group the Family Research Council had an interview with Chris Mathews that he probably should not have shown up for. Travis Webber, who is the director of the Center for Religious Liberty at Family Research Council, seemed quite incapable in this interview, constantly dancing around and attempting to avoid a valid question by MSNBC host Chris Mathews on which bathroom he would suggest for trans activist Jennifer Finney Boyland.The conversation got started when Boyland pointed out that the conservative push on bathrooms was simply an attempt to make up for lost ground after they lost the same-sex marriage battle. Boyland said: I don t think this is about bathrooms at all. I think it s about equal rights. Transgender people don t want special rights. We want equal protection under the law, and mostly what we want is to be left alone. And if we can t be left alone, we d like to be treated with love. So you don t want me in the men s room. And you know how you create that perfect situation? Just stop. Stop coming up with these laws. Stop causing trouble where there is no trouble. Maybe because now gay men and lesbians can get married, and they re no longer the whipping boys and whipping girls in this country, now maybe they re trying to rile up people against transgender people. And it s not right, and it s not fair. That s when host Chris Mathews jumped in, putting Webber on the spot, asking him,  Travis, tell Jenny what bathroom she should use. That s when Webber stumbled and paused, at one point saying,  Yeah, I mean I m not sure, um  .  Mathews then said,  Well just answer that question. Travis continued to avoid the question with a response that had nothing to do with the question, prompting Mathews to include,  See, no, you can t answer the question, can you? Webber s inability to respond to a valid question is indicative of the way conservatives have handled this issue and many others. One thread to notice about these so-called conservative GOP folks is their constant attempt to divide and deny people their rights. Whether it s supporting discrimination for same-sex couples, banning Muslims, building walls, denying rights to transgender Americans, or supporting an apartheid state like Israel which denies Palestinians human rights, the conclusion about conservatives must be that they are crazy.Watch the video here: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 14, 2016"
OBAMA’S NEW PEP PROGRAM Could Force Early Release Of Illegal Alien In Jail For Filming Woman In Walmart Bathroom,"So many good people coming across our border all just looking for a better life Thanks Obama!An illegal alien from Mexico pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges of secretly filming a woman in a Walmart bathroom and he might soon be released into the U.S., according to the local sheriff.He was sentenced to 270 days in jail and could be released as early as next month. Border Patrol currently has an immigration hold placed on the Mexican national.Jose Santos Argueta was arrested on Valentine s Day after a Hispanic woman noticed a cell phone on the floor under her public bathroom stall, according to San Angelo Live. She realized she was being filmed and contacted store security and the San Angelo Police Department. Argueta gave permission for police to go through his phone and the video was found.He has been in jail since being arrested, and the 243 days he spent behind bars will be credited towards his 270-day sentence. Despite the immigration hold placed by federal authorities, under President Obama s Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), it is possible that Argueta could be released from custody and set free as early as next month.In an interview with Breitbart Texas, Tom Green County Sheriff David Jones said it is a very real concern.  He certainly could be released,  Sheriff Jones said.  We have had several people who were convicted and turned over to federal authorities released. It is a very real concern. Sheriff Jones said he has a good working relationship with the men and women who serve as Border Patrol agents locally.  The problem,  Jones stated,  comes from the orders they receive from higher up. Breitbart Texas  Lana Shadwick has reported extensively on the work Texas sheriffs have been doing to try and make the public aware of the dangers of this PEP program. Earlier this month, Shadwick reported the Department of Justice s plans to release 2,000 foreign citizens from federal custody beginning as early as October 30.  Law enforcement should always be concerned when this number of criminals will be released.  Jackson County Sheriff Aj Louderback told Breitbart Texas in an interview. Louderback also serves as legislative director of the Sheriff s Association of Texas.  I am also concerned that although the federal government claims they will be deported, as many as 2,000 illegal aliens could be released into our communities. The October 7 Breitbart Texas article explains the issues regarding PEP:PEP is a federal program which Louderback and other law enforcement officials say  endangers communities, rather than secures them, from the ravages of illegal immigrant crime.  The sheriff is talking to anyone who will listen about the program.The PEP program has replaced a congressionally-mandated program that governed how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials dealt with criminal aliens. This program replaced the Secured Communities Program. The more aggressive 287(g) program has also been eliminated.The PEP policy was released by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in November of 2014. In January, the program went into effect and Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby exclusively reported leaked training documents detailing how the program would be implemented. Darby dubbed the program,  Catch and Release 2.0. In August, Louderback led a group of Texas sheriffs to the Texas Capitol for a press conference announcing their concerns about the PEP program. He said the PEP program forces Texas sheriffs to sometimes even release violent offenders. Louderback told Breitbart Texas at that time, that criminal aliens know that law enforcement officials in Texas have their hands tied because of these new federal policies. They know they can come into the country illegally and stay here with impunity. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Oct 16, 2015"

" Trump Faked Out Fans, Used Machine To Autograph Hats He Sold Them","Donald Trump supporters thought that when they donated to his presidential campaign, they were actually receiving  Make America Great Again  hats, books, and other merchandise actually autographed by their idol. But like so much else with Trump, this was a scam too.These items offered on his website, including signed hats and signed copies of his book  The Art of the Deal,  were heavily advertised on social media and by Trump himself. But what some buyers may not have realized is that it seems Trump didn t actually sign any of the items available for purchase on his website with his own hand. Instead, the autographs all appear to have been done by an autopen machine, a device used to automatically sign a signature.The use of an autopen machine only became evident to some after Trump won the election, when opportunists who had purchased such items off Trump s website took to eBay to re-sell what they believed would be a more valuable John Hancock.On eBay, the Trump Tribe suddenly realized that all the merchandise had been signed in the exact same identical position, impossible if he had been signing them by hand.One fan told ABC News,  You think for $183, you have to be getting the real thing. Had I known, not only would I not have bought this, but I m pretty sure no one would have. Another told the news outlet that he would like to receive a refund after shelling out money for a fake Trump autograph.Trump relies on a world in which people simply accept the snake oil he s selling and don t bother to actually verify what he s saying and compare it to reality. It s a formula that has worked for him for years and years, while he profits and walks away from businesses in collapse. And now he ll be running the country.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 19, 2016"

"TORONTO IMAM WANTS MUSLIMS To Only Do Business With Muslims, Work Together To Implement Sharia Law","We hear so much talk from the Left about working to help foreigners  assimilate. Yet here we have a prominent Imam calling for the segregation of Muslims from their host nation. How is this okay? Shaykh Said Rageah (     ) was born in Somalia and in the late 80s and moved to North America. Rageah has a Bachelor s in Islamic studies and a Masters in Shari ah and he has had several posts over the years, including: founder of Masjid Huda in Montreal and Masjid Aya in Maryland, advisor for Muslim Youth magazine, and member in the Aqsa Association.He is also the founder of both Muslim Magazine and Al Aqsa Association, and served as the Chaplain at both the University of Calgary and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). He served as an Imam at the Abu Hurairah Mosque in Toronto, the Chairman for the Journey of Faith Conference and as an instructor for the AlMaghrib Institute.In a sermon delivered at Abu Hurairah Centre in Toronto (the video was uploaded to YouTube on February 8, 2009), Imam Rageah called on Canadian Muslims to unite and translate their demography into a political and economic power that is necessary to make the government allow Muslims to implement the Islamic Law (Sharia) in their communities and to change the foreign policy.Rageah spoke in favour of following the example of the Sikh neighbourhood in Edmonton, Alberta, by bringing the Muslim community to live together in one area in which the authorities will not be able to make any decision without the approval of the Muslims.He urges Muslims to hire only Muslim workers, to buy products or services only from Muslim-owned businesses and to avoid advertising with media outlets owned by kafir, meaning unbeliever or infidel. In this way, he maintained, Canadian Muslims can strengthen themselves and live according to Islam.The following is a transcript of segments from Rageah s sermon:  With four, five [hundred] thousand Muslims you can create the most powerful lobby in Canada  with that number of Muslims you can create one of the strongest Muslim business in Toronto   If you just put our resources, if we put our resources together, if we can work together as an Ummah [Muslim nation] we can change a lot As Muslims, we are scattered all over the city. You have people living in Brampton, you have people living in Mississauga, you have people living in Whitby, you have people living in Richmond Hill. Imagine if we all get together in one area. In the City of Edmonton, the Sikh, Sikh, they live in one neighbourhood and nothing can be changed or done without their approval. We here we may as well benefit from the system that they have here. What can you do with unity? A lot. You can change a lot. You can change the foreign policy of this country. You can change how the Muslims think. You can even when need help, when you need help you call Muslim for your need you will help the Muslim community Brothers in the masjid [Mosque] right now, they are coming up with the magazine or newspaper called Ummah Times. What Ummah Times is that? Ummah Times is advertising all your businesses all the Muslim businesses [are] Ummah.  All you need to do   I will never advertise with a kafir [unbeliever, infidel], there you go. I hear some advertisements giving to 680 News $5,000. Before your Muslim brothers $50 and $80 or $100 we think twice before we do it. Unless we work together, the day we need a truck driver we know where to find truck drivers. The day that I need a cab I should have a number of a Muslim cab it s ok, pick me up. When I wan to see a doctor, only Muslim doctor. When I want to hire someone only Muslim worker. Then we can strengthen ourselves. This is the way and this is the only way we can exist in the society, living according to Islam. When the Sharia [Islamic Law], when the government of Toronto, Ontario gave us a break and said: deal your internal affairs based on your Sharia [Islamic Law] we did not go and say: Those few people are Ismailis and Ahmadis, they are not even Muslims. Why would they speak on behalf of Muslims. But, we say no, we keep quiet and see and watch what happens, and then the result was that they said  we will never allow you to rule yourselves, your internal affairs based on the Shariah My brothers in faith [     ], anything that happens in your Muslim community, in the City of Toronto, anything that can be done, five hundred thousand Muslims that is a great number, large number, you can do a lot, work together. Let s be an Ummah [nation] Take your children to Islamic schools. Take your vehicle to Muslim owned business. If you buy a vehicle make sure there is a Muslim business or car dealer that sells cars. If you want to do anything just ask if that individual is a Muslim or not. If he is not, then look for a Muslim, because I m sure you ll find a Muslim. I m sure you ll find a Muslim in that field    O Allah, Raise the standing of Islam and the Muslims [       ], and humiliate the infidels and the polytheists.

 Bernie Sanders Rocked 3 Rallies In Florida Yesterday,"Yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders swept through North Florida, holding rallies in Gainesville, Tampa Bay, and Kissimee (outside of Orlando), with turnouts in each rally exceeding 5,000 people each. I attended the rally in Gainesville. I know that Florida is a big football country, right?  Senator Sanders told the crowd in Gainesville, home of the University of Florida Gators.  But unless you are on the playing field, football is a spectator sport. Democracy is not a spectator sport. In Florida, voter turnout, especially for Democrats, is a big issue. There are more than 300,000 Democrats registered in the state of Florida than Republicans. Despite Democrats consisting of the majority of voters in the state, Republicans hold majorities in the State Senate, State House, the Governorship, and 17 out of 27 congressional districts. A Florida Democrat, besides U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, hasn t won a statewide election since Alex Sink was elected CFO in 2006.The rally in Gainesville was filled with all sorts of different people. A trio of Native Americans dressed in traditional garments sat in one of the rows in front of the press box. College kids screamed with excitement as though they were at a Justin Timberlake concert. Veterans cheered with signs of support. A local punk band warmed up the crowd in anticipation for Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard to introduce Senator Sanders. At the end of Sanders  speech, supporters stormed towards the stage desperately trying to get a selfie with Bernie or at least get close enough to shake his hand.Normally, this excitement is reserved for Justin Bieber concerts or NFL football games, but all over the country apathy and disenfranchisement from the American political system is losing out to Americans, young, old, and every demographic in between, getting excited about having a voice, and being heard on issues that affect us all. Whether you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, a Hillary Clinton supporter, or like them both, what Senator Sanders  presidential campaign has done for the Democratic Party by not only rejuvenating progressive ideals, but inspiring voters to actively participate again, is something every Democrat can take pride in.

WOW! CONFIRMED BY ICE: 5-Time Deported ILLEGAL ALIEN Protected By Sanctuary County Is Suspected ARSONIST Behind Worst Fires CA History,"Remember when candidate Donald Trump was condemned by the left for telling Americans that we have criminals coming across our borders? Well, it turns out that he was not only correct, it appears as though the worst fire in California s history that caused the death of 42 so far and over $1 billion in damage to almost 3,000 homes was very likely started by an ILLEGAL ALIEN arsonist. From Donald Trump s campaign speech at a rally in Arizona: The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else s problems. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best. They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us.  They re bringing drugs, they re bringing crime, they re rapists and some, I assume are good people. Watch:Well, now that ICE has confirmed that the arsonist arrested in connection with setting the fires that devastated California is a 5-time deported ILLEGAL ALIEN, who in the media is going to tell Trump they re  sorry  for criticizing him? Will it be one of the local government officials in Sonoma County who decided to make their county a  sanctuary county  to protect people like Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday?Breitbart   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Tom Homan confirmed on Thursday that a man arrested in connection with setting a fire in Sonoma County Wine Country is an illegal alien from Mexico who has been twice returned to his  home country. Homan also confirmed that ICE has issued detainer requests for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez five times now in the past year alone, including the one issued on October 16 in relation to his most recent arrest on suspicion of arson. All of the arrests were made  by Sonoma County on various felony and misdemeanor charges,  according to Homan.Sonoma County is considered a sanctuary jurisdiction and does not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials. That includes not honoring ICE detainer requests.  ICE was never notified of Mr. Gonzalez  various releases,  Homan wrote in the statement regarding Gonzalez.There were several fires in the region, and it is not clear what role the fires Gonzales allegedly set played in the overall disaster.The LA Times reported on the incident from eyewitnesses after Gonzalez was seen leaving the scene of the fire: He was screaming really bad things at the police when he was arrested,  recalled David Moreno, 29, who witnessed the arrest.  He was yelling things like,  I m going to teach you a lesson you ll never forget. Three Sonoma County probation officers patrolling Maxwell Farms Regional Park just before 3 p.m. noticed a plume of smoke rising from an area near the Sonoma Creek, Sheriff s Department spokeswoman Misti Harris said.Gonzalez walked away from the fire as the officers approached, Harris said. Nobody else was in the area,  Harris said.Sonoma County Sheriff s Department deputies followed Gonzalez to a nearby McDonald s. Gonzalez had  previous contacts  with law enforcement, she said.Gonzalez told police he started the fire because he was cold, Harris said. Officers found a lighter in his pocket.*The recorded temperature at the time that the fires started was a balmy 78 degrees.Some homeless people who knew Gonzalez said that he had a habit of setting fire to brush along the creek bed.Tensions were already high in this smoke-filled region, about 25 miles east of Santa Rosa.Local mechanic Shawn Stephensen, 40, said,  A few days ago I was walking down the street with a gas can and someone driving by stopped to say,  I wouldn t be carrying a thing like that around at a time like this. At first I didn t get it,  Stephensen, who knew Gonzalez, said.  Then it dawned on me    Oh yeah, instant felony case. What will Governor Jerry Brown, who recently signed off on legislation that makes the entire state of California a  sanctuary state  have to say about this recent development?

 Watch: Joe Biden Just Wrecked Trump In Six Words And It’s Hilarious,"Former Vice President Joe Biden was asked on Monday by Matt Lauer on NBC s  Today  to name something specific that Donald Trump has been  doing well. Well, that seems like a trick question since Trump has passed no major legislation and reaches across the aisle only to take shots at Democrats in his Twitter timeline during his morning rage-tweets, so Biden struggled to find something, anything, that Trump has done well since taking office. I think there s a number of things he s doing well. But even the things he s doing well, it s how he does them,  Biden said. It s more the tone of this administration that bothers me,  he continued. With all due respect, you haven t come up with one thing you think he s doing well,  Lauer said. Well, I think he married very well,  Biden joked.Although, Biden didn t mention which of Trump s three marriages he s speaking of. Trump s first marriage to Ivana ended after he had an affair with Marla Maples. Trump went on to marry Maples, then they divorced. Trump is currently married to Melania. All three of Trump s wives are former models. Trump is a former reality show star. But, in all instances, he did marry up, since there is no  down  that Trump hasn t hit yet.After struggling to come up with something, Biden eventually praised Trump s choice of keeping military personnel stationed in the Middle East that was there at the end of the Obama administration.Watch:""What do you think Trump is doing well?""""I think he married very well.""Joe Biden answers questions on @TODAYshow https://t.co/F6EKxHe64M  NBC News (@NBCNews) November 13, 2017In January, Biden had some advice for Trump.

" Trump Said America ‘Never’ Wins, But Obama Just Took Out A Major Terrorist","On Friday, Donald Trump gave a speech to the NRA after picking up their endorsement ahead of the general election (they don t care if he has a week record on guns, as long as he s a Republican), and in his speech Trump made an insane claim about the country he hopes to lead. Trump proclaimed,  We don t win anymore. We never win. This is, of course, absurd. You can check out the hashtag #WeWinDonald for examples of America winning over the last 240 years (disclosure: I started it).But before the ink on the NRA s endorsement was even dry, along came news of another American victory. This time against the Taliban, who once harbored Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks (his death, another win for America).The Pentagon says it launched an airstrike in Afghanistan Saturday targeting Mullah Akhtar Mansur, the Taliban s overall leader. Though the Pentagon is still assessing the results of the airstrike a U.S. official said Mansur was  likely killed  in the airstrike personally authorized by President Obama. Today, the Department of Defense conducted an airstrike that targeted Taliban leader Mullah Mansur in a remote area of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region,  said Peter Cook, the Pentagon s Press Secretary in a statement released Saturday.The Pentagon press secretary also explained that Mansur has been  actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners. President Obama authorized the drone strike that appears to have killed the Taliban leader while en route to Vietnam on Air Force One.You may remember that President Obama s epic correspondent s dinner roast of Donald Trump came at the same time the Bin Laden raid was about to be executed. Perhaps it s time to start panicking if you re in Al Qaeda or the Taliban   or ISIS   when Trump s buffoonery is in the news.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 22, 2016"
 Proof Ted Cruz Only Wants The Already Healthy And Wealthy To Have Healthcare (VIDEO),"It has been the life s work of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He s obsessed, really. And it really seems to stem from not wanting President Obama to get credit for being the president that completely overhauled the healthcare system. Proof of this is in his response to any question regarding what he would do instead. He wants to repeal it   to make it his own.However, when Cruz was asked directly about his plan for healthcare during the most recent GOP debate, he answered, or rather didn t answer, the moderator s question.Fox News  Bret Baier asked Cruz: Today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it. So the question, Sen. Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will: Will you be fine if millions of those people don t have health insurance, and what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured? And here s Cruz s non-answer, completely dodging the question: If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need health care reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting between us and our doctors. Three specific reforms that reflect those principles: Number 1, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That ll create a true 50-state national marketplace while will drive down the cost of low-cost catastropic health insurance. Number 2, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine health care needs. And Number 3, we should work to delink health insurance from employment, so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you, and it is personal, portable, and affordable, and I tell you, Bret I think that s a much more attractive vision for health care than the Washington-driven, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions to hurt. To summarize: Cruz wants to make it so healthcare is only available on the free market, and with regard to what his plan for those who become uninsured due to the repeal of Obamacare, well, he doesn t have one.One of the key components to the Affordable Healthcare Act is making sure insurance companies can no longer deny coverage based upon preexisting conditions. If the law is repealed, healthcare companies will be able to go back to these harmful practices and leave control of coverage back in the hands of for-profit care. Thus, in the hands of those who see it in their best interest to deny care to those they may deem too expensive to cover, because it would harm profits. Cruz seems to be in favor of this happening, since he didn t even touch upon it in his response.In addition, Cruz wants to make it so those who are covered by their employers are no longer covered, and would have to completely pay out-of-pocket for care. This makes it remarkably hard for those in low wage earning positions to even remotely dream of having care. The only people Cruz s plan helps are the wealthy and business owners who will no longer be required to offer coverage to their employees. His plan is in no way whatsoever beneficial to the average American. However, he words it in such a smarmy, salesman-type way that the average American won t pick up on the scam.Cruz wants the government completely out of healthcare which sounds great on paper if you only think of things in black and white. However, the reality of the situation is millions of people rely on the government subsidies granted in the Affordable Care Act, millions also rely upon Medicaid, and even more rely upon the fact that Obamacare makes it so insurance companies can t deny a person based upon a preexisiting condition.Don t fall for the evils of Cruz in his effort to bring America back to an era of people dying because they can t afford coverage, which is exactly what he is proposing.

 Elizabeth Warren SMASHES Trump Over His $100 Million Ties To A Foreign Bank,"Donald Trump s many business ventures mean that he s got business relationships with many banks, including Wall Street banks. He could easily waltz into the White House owing at least $100 million to Deutsche Bank, which creates a massive conflict of interest that many have pointed out. Deutsche Bank has been heavily penalized by our government for repeated violations, and having business ties to Trump means they could whip him into letting them off the hook just to preserve his businesses, creating a massive conflict of interest.Now, anti-Wall Street crusader Elizabeth Warren has joined the chorus of voices decrying this, slamming Trump and his relationship with Deutsche Bank in a statement to Mother Jones: The job of the President is to enforce the law fairly. If a serial lawbreaker like Deutsche Bank is caught manipulating markets again, how would Trump hold it accountable knowing that the bank had the power to pull the plug on his own businesses? That s a question that should worry every American. These financial entanglements along with many of his other ongoing business concerns and arrangements present huge conflicts of interest. Deutsche Bank settled with U.S. regulators for things like fixing metals prices and rigging interest rates   that s what Warren means when she calls them a  serial lawbreaker,  but they re fighting us on other things and have been for years. They re among the banks that screwed the little guy that Trump claims to stand for in order to enrich themselves.Having Trump in the White House could easily allow them to put our regulators over a barrel, and he ll have to break his promises to the little guy.Two weeks ago, Warren attacked Trump for saying that he d made money off of the 2008 economic crash, which is something for which everyone should attack him because that s just sick for a presidential candidate to say.

" California Tells NRA To F*ck Off, Passes Several Gun Reforms","While the federal government is at a chronic standstill in dealing with gun violence, the largest state in the union is doing something about it. On Friday, California s governor, Jerry Brown, signed six bills into law that would make it harder for the wrong people to get guns.The bills would require background checks to buy ammunition and the purchase would be registered with the California Department of Justice. The term  assault rifle  will be broadened to include more guns, as assault rifles can only be loaned to family and magazines will be limited to 10 rounds or fewer. My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,  Brown said in a statement.Source: USA TodayBrown also vetoed some bills, including one that would make stealing a gun grand theft. That, Brown said,  proposes to add an initiative that is nearly identical to one which will already appear on the November 2016 ballot. He also vetoed a bill that expanded the definition of  firearm  to include the homemade kind. It also would have limited purchases of guns to one a month.  While well-intentioned, I believe this bill would have the effect of burdening lawful citizens who wish to sell certain firearms that they no longer need.  said Brown.The third vetoed bill would have allowed employers, coworkers, metal health workers and school workers to get restraining orders against gun violence. Currently, restraining orders are only available to family members when it comes to gun violence.The fourth would require gun theft victims to report to law enforcement within five days.  I continue to believe that responsible people report the loss or theft of a firearm and irresponsible do not,  Brown said.  It is not likely that this bill would change that. California currently has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation. They work. The last time California passed major gun laws was in the early 1990s and the result has been dramatic.Gun violence across California dropped 56% from 5,500 gun deaths in 1993 to 2,935 in 2010, according to the study, which took into account California s expanded population from about 30 to 37 million people over the same period.Among all 50 states, California has perhaps the strongest gun control laws.  California is at the very top end of firearms regulation,  legal expert Bryan L. Ciyou and author of  Gun Laws By State  told msnbc.The current laws include a ban on military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. There are also laws empowering law enforcement and adding safety requirements to handguns. The bills that Brown just signed will strengthen the laws that are currently on the books.Featured image via Justin Sullivan with Getty Images",News,"July 1, 2016"
 Ammon Bundy’s Lunatic Militia Men Facing More Charges From The Feds,"The saga surrounding the idiots who decided to invade and occupy a federal building on a wildlife preserve in Oregon continues. Though the occupation itself is over, the legal troubles for this group of right-wing loons are just beginning. It has been reported that Bundy and his band of nutbags have been indicted on yet more federal charges.These latest indictments state that they will be facing charges because they had weapons in federal facilities, as well as with vandalism and theft of property belonging to the government. The original federal charges drop the hammer on the group   26 people charged in all   for conspiracy to disrupt the duties of federal agents. Also, their infamous stealing of a government truck for a grocery store trip is included in these latest indictments. There are also charges of using weapons during violent criminal activity.Another blow came to the group when the death of LaVoy Finicum was ruled  justified and necessary. Further, another occupier, Sean Anderson and an unnamed accomplice are charged with destruction of sacred artifacts belonging to a local Native American tribe.The fact that any of this happened at all is nothing short of absolutely disgraceful. This nonsense about being able to take over federal land whenever they please is treason. Hopefully, the charges being handed down are serious enough for all of these lunatics to do some very hard time in a federal lock-up.They went into this thinking that they could cause another Waco-type situation, but luckily there was only one death, despite all of those weapons and lunatic gun nuts hellbent on dying for this ridiculously misguided  cause.  There is no cause here. That land belongs to the federal government, and these people are just lawless fools who are a danger to themselves and the rest of society.Lock them up and throw away the key.Featured image via screen capture from WMUR/Addicting Info archives",News,"March 10, 2016"

 WATCH: Fox Host Stuart Varney Agrees That Trump Won’t Make America Great By Insulting People,"Trump supporter and Fox host Stuart Varney has finally had enough if Trump s petty Twitter insults.Donald Trump s attack on Meryl Streep was a step too far for Fox Business host Stuart Varney and his guests on Monday.During the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, Streep delivered an amazing defense of Hollywood, the press, disabled people, and foreigners without mentioning Trump by name. There was nothing good about it,  Streep said of Trump s campaign.  But it was effective, and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter- someone he outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. Predictably, instead of letting it go, Trump lashed out at Streep on Twitter.Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn t know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017Now, Trump has been throwing these little hissy fits for quite some time now, especially after becoming president-elect, which is really embarrassing because presidents usually do not hurl insults like a petulant child at people who disagree with them.And Fox Business host Stuart Varney, who is a big supporter of Trump, agrees that he crossed the line and only hurt himself and the office he will hold on January 20th.During his show, journalist Elizabeth MacDonald expressed her thoughts about Trump s tirade. How does name calling make American great again?  she asked.  Doesn t that undercut Mr. Trump s agenda by responding in ways like this? I mean, he demeans himself. You cannot expect people to climb on board with your agenda when your judgement is so poor in making attacks like that. Indeed, such attacks only divide our country and reflect poorly on Trump as he continued to destroy the dignity of the presidency even though he s not even the president yet. I got it and I think you re right,  Varney replied simply before moving on to a new story.Here s the video via YouTube:Every time Donald Trump lashes out at someone on Twitter he embarrasses himself, the office of the presidency, and this nation. He needs to learn to ignore criticism, or better yet, listen to it and learn from it instead of throwing a temper tantrum.Featured image via screenshot",News,"January 9, 2017"
 Dan Rather Brilliantly Rips Trump’s Lawless Week In SCATHING Facebook Post,"Donald Trump has had what is arguably the most bizarre week in the history of the American presidency. He has careened from outrage to outrage, lie to lie, and lawless action to lawless action   all in the span of five days, starting with his firing of FBI Director James Comey because he threw a massive tantrum over the Trump-Russia collusion investigation. Well, there is one respected American who has had about enough of Trump s acting as if he is above the law: journalist Dan Rather.Rather took to his Facebook page to rip Trump to shreds as only he can. He begins by talking about how long he s lived and how many presidencies he s lived through   including Richard Nixon s   and then moves on to the extraordinary disgrace that is the Donald Trump presidency. Rather says, in part:But I have never seen a week where a president of our nation has behaved with such a cavalier disregard for the norms and institutions of our democracy. And it now seems like the investigation is expanding into Trump s business dealings. The comparisons with Richard Nixon are plentiful these days, but even he did not seem so untethered from our basic governance. And I have never seen so many members of a political party rally around incompetence, intemperance, and inanity.Dan Rather is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. Trump is downright dangerous, and he must be restrained. If only the Congress would do their jobs and speak out, and act as the check on this president that they are supposed to be. Hell, they were more than happy to be a check on President Obama   and he didn t even do anything that was lawless.This is the Republican Party putting partisan politics and their own political futures above the good of the republic. It is shameful, and that is why we must vote them out of Congress in 2018.Mr. Rather, thank you for speaking truth to power.

BUCKLE UP: 2008 Was Just A “Warm-Up”…Facts Show The REAL Financial Crisis Is Coming,"A fake economy can only sustain itself for so long The Fed is out of control,  exclaims David Stockman   perhaps best known for architecting Reagan s economic turnaround known as  Morning in America    adding that  people don t want to hear the reality and the truth that we re facing. Well, it s one of the scariest moments I think in our history, but also we need to recognize we re in uncharted waters. No central bank has ever printed this much money this long, kept interest rates at zero, fueled so much speculation. Not just here, but worldwide.-David StockmanFor six years, the world has operated under a complete delusion that Central Banks somehow fixed the 2008 Crisis.All of the arguments claiming this defied common sense. A 5th grader would tell you that you cannot solve a debt problem by issuing more debt. If the below chart was a problem BEFORE 2008  there is no way that things are better now. After all, we ve just added another $10 trillion in debt to the US system.Similarly, anyone with a functioning brain could tell you that a bunch of academics with no real-world experience, none of whom have ever started a business or created a single job can t  save  the economy.However, there is an AWFUL lot of money at stake in believing these lies. So the media and the banks and the politicians were happy to promote them. Indeed, one could very easily argue that nearly all of the wealth and power held by those at the top of the economy stem from this fiction.So it s little surprise that no one would admit the facts: that the Fed and other Central Banks not only don t have a clue how to fix the problem, but that they actually have almost no incentive to do so.So here are the facts:1) The REAL problem for the financial system is the bond bubble. In 2008 when the crisis hit it was $80 trillion. It has since grown to over $100 trillion.2)The derivatives market that uses this bond bubble as collateral is over $555 trillion in size.3)Many of the large multinational corporations, sovereign governments, and even municipalities have used derivatives to fake earnings and hide debt. NO ONE knows to what degree this has been the case, but given that 20% of corporate CFOs have admitted to faking earnings in the past, it s likely a significant amount.4) Corporations today are more leveraged than they were in 2007. As Stanley Druckenmiller noted recently, in 2007 corporate bonds were $3.5 trillion  today they are $7 trillion: an amount equal to nearly 50% of US GDP.5) The Central Banks are now all leveraged at levels greater than or equal to where Lehman Brothers was when it imploded. The Fed is leveraged at 78 to 1. The ECB is leveraged at over 26 to 1. Lehman Brothers was leveraged at 30 to 1.6) The Central Banks have no idea how to exit their strategies. Fed minutes released from 2009 show Janet Yellen was worried about how to exit when the Fed s balance sheet was $1.3 trillion (back in 2009). Today it s over $4.5 trillion.We are heading for a crisis that will be exponentially worse than 2008. The global Central Banks have literally bet the financial system that their theories will work. They haven t. All they ve done is set the stage for an even worse crisis in which entire countries will go bankrupt.The situation is clear: the 2008 Crisis was the warm up. The next Crisis will be THE REAL Crisis. The Crisis in which Central Banking itself will fail. Via: Zero HedgeDavid Stockman:Well, it s one of the scariest moments I think in our history, but also we need to recognize we re in uncharted waters. No central bank has ever printed this much money this long, kept interest rates at zero, fueled so much speculation. Not just here, but worldwide. Not just in the normal stocks and bonds, but the whole shale boom, for instance, in the United States was massively funded by cheap debt based on oil prices that weren t sustainable, and now that s all coming unwound. We have never had deficits of ten percent of GDP back to back, or even still four or five percent four or five years into a recovery.We have a runaway budget where the population is getting older and older, 10,000 people are retiring every day. Nothing is being done about Social Security. It s a festering time bomb, and we re not sure how it will explode, but we know it isn t sustainable. We have a Wall Street that is more addicted to pure overnight gambling and trading and speculation for the ultra short run that is driven by robo traders, the so-called HFT money, like never before. It s unstable. That s why we see things happen like the overnight 40 percent gain with the Swiss Franc when the Swiss National Bank pulled the pay.Forty percent overnight   not overnight, but in a couple of minutes or seconds when there were hundreds of billions of short positions in the Swiss Franc. All of these things have never existed simultaneously, not only in the United States, but worldwide. All the central banks are doing it. We re reaching the point where it s unsustainable, things are going to give and break, but the good thing is it s going to be more a disaster in the financial markets in my view, less some kind of Great Depression impact on Main Street. It will be difficult on Main Street, but Wall Street is in the gun sites of this disaster coming.",politics,"Oct 29, 2015"
WATCH YOUNG TEENAGE THUGS AS THEY ROB FEMALE REPORTER Filming #BaltimoreRiots,"Because nothing says  justice  for Freddie Gray like a large group of teenage thugs descending on a defenseless woman and stealing her purse A producer for Ruptly, a video news service run by RT (formerly Russia Today), was robbed on camera while filming the violent protests in Baltimore overnight.The dramatic video shows the female victim first surrounded and harassed by a group of youths, who rapidly grow bolder reaching out at her, all the while hurling a stream of vulgarity and ranting about the police. She is then clearly physically attacked by the group. As the video stabilizes you see that the producer is chasing the thieves down the street trying to retrieve her stolen bag before the intervention of the Baltimore police.The protests in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray while in custody turned into violent riots overnight Saturday into Sunday morning. So much so that 30,000 people were locked down in Camden Yards.As Twitchy notes, at the time of the lockdown President Obama was delivering jokes to the mainstream media and assorted celebrities about a half hour away.Toward the end of the video, the woman who was robbed can be heard sobbing as she continues to film.Via: RT Ruptly",politics,"Apr 26, 2015"
THREE SHOCKING REASONS WHY Hillary Clinton Is Considered An Abortion EXTREMIST," EXTREME POSITIONS ON ABORTIONHillary Clinton positioned herself as a moderate on abortion for much of her career, but now holds the most extreme positions on abortion of any presidential candidate ever.Here are three reasons why:1. She wants taxpayers to pay for abortion.Clinton supports government funding for abortion. On June 10, Clinton delivered a speech at a Planned Parenthood event in which she called for repealing the Hyde Amendment, a policy that prevents taxpayer funding for abortion. Let s repeal laws like the Hyde Amendment that make it nearly impossible   for low-income women, disproportionately women of color, to exercise their full reproductive rights,  she said.The Democratic National Committee added this goal to its platform after Clinton became the nominee.An August YouGov poll found that 55 percent of Americans support the Hyde Amendment. This includes a large number of Democrats, who are about evenly divided. Forty-one percent of Democrats support the ban on abortion funding while 44 percent oppose it, which is within the poll s margin of error (4.8 percentage points for the full sample).2. She supports abortion until birth.Clinton supports abortion up until the moment of birth.She doesn t say it exactly like that, of course, because it sounds awful when you say a baby can be legally killed right before she s born. Instead, Clinton uses some shifty Clintonian lingo.Clinton has said she supports restrictions only in the third trimester and only if there are exceptions for the  life and health of the mother.  (In one interview she said there should only be restrictions at the  very end of the third trimester. ) But as Clinton understands, and most voters don t, the  health exception  is just a huge loophole that allows for abortion for any reason.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Doe v. Bolton, the companion case to Roe v. Wade, that the health exception can be whatever the abortionist decides it is.An abortionist s  medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors   physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman s age   relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health,  the court decided.So, when Clinton says she ll only support abortion restrictions in the third trimester if there is a health exception, she is effectually saying there should be no restrictions on abortion through the entire pregnancy. She admits this when pressed on the issue.In an April appearance on ABC s  The View,  Clinton was asked if she supports legal abortion  just hours before delivery,  and she agreed. That same week, on NBC s  Meet the Press,  she was asked,  when or if does an unborn child have constitutional rights?  She answered,  the unborn person doesn t have constitutional rights. A July 16 Marist poll found that only 13 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal  through the entire pregnancy.  Similarly, a 2012 Gallup poll found only 14 percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal  in the last three months of pregnancy,  and a July 2014 HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 59 percent of Americans support a ban on abortions after 20-weeks of gestation, which is during the second trimester. 3. She thinks abortion should be common, not rare.Clinton no longer argues that abortion should be rare.During his 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton s husband, Bill, said that abortion should be  safe, legal and rare.  It was controversial at the time within the pro-choice community because saying that abortion should be  rare  implies that there is something wrong with getting an abortion. (What could that be?) But the phrase helped establish Bill Clinton s public image as a moderate on abortion.Read more: Christian Post",politics,"Oct 7, 2016"
JOHN KERRY BREAKS LEG IN BIKE CRASH IN FRENCH ALPS… [Video],"Fortunately, our useless Secretary of State John Kerry was able to make France a part of his taxpayer funded four-nation trip where he had hoped to ride along a small part of the Tour de France according to the Washington Post. Unfortunately, he was unable to take part in the Tour de France or um Iran s nuclear negotiations due to his accident. Our nation is likely better off without John Kerry at the negotiating table with Iran s prime minister anyhow US Secretary of State John Kerry broke his leg in a bike crash Sunday, apparently after hitting a curb while taking a break after talks in Geneva, Switzerland.The diplomat was biking near Scionzier, France before the accident, which caused him to scrap the rest of a four-nation trip that included an international conference on combating the Islamic State group.Kerry, 71, was in stable condition and in good spirits as he prepared to return to Boston for further treatment with the doctor who previously operated on his hip, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said.He said X-rays at a Swiss hospital confirmed that Kerry fractured his right femur in the 9.40am incident. The secretary is stable and never lost consciousness, his injury is not life-threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery,  Kirby said in a statement.Kerry was taken by helicopter to Geneva s main medical center, HUG, after apparently hitting a curb with his bike in the French town about 40 kilometers southeast of the Swiss border.Paramedics and a physician were on the scene with his motorcade at the time and provided him immediate attention. They quickly decided to order the 10-minute-long helicopter transport.Kerry s cycling rides have become a regular occurrence on his trips. He often takes his bike with him on the plane and was riding that bicycle Sunday. Via: UK Daily Mail",politics,"May 31, 2015"
US Advising Soldiers to Be ‘Less Masculine’ as Military Tries to Curb Flood of Sexual Harassment Cases,"170619-N-AA175-092..SAN DIEGO (June 19, 2017) Command Master Chief (Ret.) Kathleen Henson, from Midland, Mich.,, center, and USS Makin Island (LHD 8) Sailors cut a cake during the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month observance. Makin Island is homeported in San Diego. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Eric Zeak   Published at Wikicommons)21st Century Wire says While military forces are fighting one enemy in the theatre of combat, another multi-front culture war is also being fought within their institutions. According to a recent report in Military.com, US military lawyers have begun speaking about how sexual assault cases are flooding the military courts   threatening to break the back of the military s legal system, and perhaps radically alter the institutional culture.After the release of the documentary,  The Invisible War,  the issue of sexual assault in the military has again been thrust into the national spotlight, claiming that 1 in 5 U.S. female veterans have sustained some form of sexual assault.The issue of sexual assault in the US military first rose to national prominence in 1992 with the emergence of the infamous  Tailhook Scandal. One likely reason for this new spike in reported cases could be because each military service branch has recently implemented new  awareness programs  as well as  sexual assault prevention  campaigns   which actively encourage female troops to report anything they might feel constitutes sexual harassment or a constitutes a sexual assault.This also comes at a time where the US military has undergone the gradual process of becoming more  gay friendly  in order to advance  issues of equality  and to cater for its growing ranks of LGBT service men and women.Military.com explains how the new liberal progressive agenda may be adversely affecting operations: Military lawyers said the Pentagon leadership has the right intentions, but these prevention campaigns have flooded military court rooms with so many sexual assault cases, it s made it harder to prosecute guilty sexual predators.Prosecutors lack witnesses or strong evidence in the majority of cases, making it hard to yield a conviction, said Michael Waddington, a military defense lawyer and former judge advocate in the Army. He sees too many cases that involve alcohol and depend on hearsay.The military has the resources to take many sexual assault cases to court, said Philip Cave, a military defense lawyer and retired Navy lawyer. Waddington estimated that ninety percent of the sexual assault cases taken to court-martial would be thrown out in a civilian court because of a lack of evidence.As a result, the military are now trying various other different initiatives to try and cope with a problem which to have spun out of control.RT International reports Promoting empathy and cracking down on hypermasculinity may help the Department of Defense to reduce unwanted sexual behavior and improve combat readiness, a new government report on sexual violence in the military says.Unwanted sexual behaviors   such as sexual harassment, sexual assault, and domestic violence    undermine core values, unit cohesion, combat readiness, and public goodwill, says the report, published this month by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and signed by Brenda Farrell, director of defense capabilities and management.The report pointed out that  interconnected, inappropriate behaviors  are part of a  continuum of harm  that creates a climate conducive to sexual harassment, assault and violence. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2017 expanded the definition of sexual harassment in the military beyond sex discrimination, to make it  an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault.  Both the Pentagon and the separate service branches have yet to update their policies to reflect this new definition, the GAO found.The report also urged the Pentagon to incorporate the guidelines for preventing and dealing with sexual violence developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The Pentagon is ignoring risk factors identified by the CDC such as  alcohol and drug use, hypermasculinity, emotionally unsupportive family environments, general tolerance of sexual violence within the community, and societal norms that support male superiority and sexual entitlement,  the report says.NEWPORT, R.I. (Oct. 29, 2010) Gunnery Sgt. Duncan Hurst encourages an officer candidate to properly perform pushups during the first week of the 12-week Officer Candidate School at Naval Station Newport. Hurst is one of 12 Marine Drill Instructors who train the candidates in military bearing, discipline, drill and physical fitness. (U. S. Navy photo by Scott A. Thornbloom/Released). Also ignored by the DoD are protective factors such as  emotional health and connectedness, and empathy and concern for how one s actions affect others. CDC s research has also established that survivors of one form of violence are more likely to be victims of other forms of violence, that survivors of violence are at higher risk for behaving violently, and that people who behave violently are more likely to commit other forms of violence,  the GAO report notes, apparently seeking to make a distinction between violence in authorized military conflict and personal violence.Noting that the DoD instructed the services in 2014 to develop mechanisms for reporting incidents of sexual harassment anonymously, the GAO said that such mechanisms are not yet part of the department-wide sexual violence policies.Additionally, each service branch uses a different database format to record formal complaints of sexual harassment   the Navy uses Excel spreadsheets, for example. While the GAO does not go as far as to recommend a single database, the report does advocate  improving and standardizing data collection  so that the Department of Defense can  further develop its understanding of the connection between unwanted sexual behaviors. Having a single standard across service branches would also be helpful, the GAO report says, noting that the US Marine Corps (USMC) updated its standards of conduct in May. The USMC made the change in response to the  Marines United  scandal, where current and former members posted nude photos of female recruits in a Facebook group, along with disparaging comments. While the Marines now consider posting nude photos of others without consent to be harassment, other service branches do not as of yet.The GAO report comes at a time of renewed interest in sexual harassment in the US. Accusations of improper behavior have forced a number of Hollywood celebrities, media executives and members of Congress to resign or be removed from public life.In 2015, the Obama administration lifted restrictions on having women in combat roles and set a deadline for allowing openly transgender troops to serve. In July this year, President Donald Trump said he would not allow transgender people to serve  in any capacity,  citing  tremendous medical costs and disruption  to the military. The matter is currently being fought over in the courts.So far, only men are required to register for potential draft ( Selective Service ) under US law. Attempts to expand the requirement to women have failed to get enough votes in Congress.See more at RTREAD THE FULL US GOV T G.A.O.

LISTEN TO HILLARY LAUGH…As She Recalls Helping Suspected Child Rapist Walk Free [VIDEO],"How very  Presidential She s cold calculating..deceitful but she has a vagina, so that s a good enough reason for women to vote for her. After all..it s Hillary s turn! So vote for the wife of a rapist, who laughs about getting child rapists off with plea bargains. It s been 16 long years without a Clinton in the White House  let s make America Sleazy again!It s time to make history with the first female President because our first  Historic black President  worked out so well In a newly unearthed audio interview Hillary Clinton reveals how she managed to get a plea bargain for a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl   and shockingly laughs as she indicated she knew he may have been guilty.During the course of the conversation which dates from the early 1980s, Clinton, then 27, outlines how she used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor to walk free.Indeed, so cavalier is her attitude to securing the freedom of a man suspected of raping a child that the shocking and candid interview may tarnish her role as an advocate for women and children in the United States.The recordings which date from 1983-1987 were discovered by the Washington Free Beacon and are of Clinton recalling her role in the most important criminal case of her career.Who knew Killary had such a strong southern accent?This is not the first time that the trial has been written about.In 2008 at the height of her primary battle with Barack Obama, a Newsday story focused on Clinton s deeply controversial strategy of attacking the credibility of the girl. Rodham, records show, questioned the sixth grader s honesty and claimed she had made false accusations in the past. She implied that the girl often fantasized and sought out  older men  like Taylor, according to a July 1975 affidavit signed  Hillary D. Rodham   in compact cursive,  wrote Newsday.The girl was a family friend and Clinton has acknowledged in her past 2003 memoir, Living History, the difficulties the case provided her having just moved to Fayetteville. to run the University of Arkansas  new legal aid clinic. This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn t, and all this stuff,  says Clinton.However, what is most shocking is the breezy manner in which she discusses her clients crime and the offhand way in which she questions his innocence. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed   which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,  she says with a laugh.Indeed, Clinton laughs during several different parts of the interview   especially when she discusses the forensic lab destroying key evidence   which led to Taylor getting away with the crime.But, Ronald Rotunda, a professor of legal ethics at Chapman University, told the Washington Free Beacon.  We don t have to believe the client is innocent our job is to represent the client in the best way we can within the bounds of the law. However, he did raise the possibility that Clinton may have breached the attorney-client privilege by discussing the case so openly. You can t do that,  he said.  Unless the client says:  You re free to tell people that you really think I m a scumbag, and the only reason I got a lighter sentence is because you re a really clever lawyer.

He was taken to the hospital where he suffocated to death in front of doctors who refused to treat him because he was covered in sewer sludge. The doctors refused to treat him because they were fasting and said my son was  napaak (unclean),  Irshad Masih, the sewer worker s mother, told Pakistan s Express Tribune.Muslims across the world are currently observing the holy month of Ramadan, which requires them to abstain from eating, drinking and sex during daylight hours, but treating the worker does not appear to fall under these rules. Muslim medical professionals across the world frequently work with patients in all sorts of conditions during the holy month. -Daily Caller",left-news,"Jun 3, 2017"

 Ellen DeGeneres Tells Hillary Clinton To Her Face Who She Wants As President (VIDEO),"With the primaries getting closer and the choice for Democratic nominee for president becoming a choice between Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, more and more people are letting their opinions be known when it comes to who they want to lead the nation.And while Sanders is definitely getting his fair share of endorsements, Clinton has been receiving quite a few lately. Between Planned Parenthood and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords giving her the nod back to back, now another person has told Hillary to her face that she has every aspect that they d like to see in a president.While appearing on the The Ellen Show, Clinton sat down with host Ellen DeGeneres, who then let her feelings be known directly to the candidate: I mean, I ve said it before, that you ve been held to a completely different standard than everyone else seems to be, you know, held to. You know what a supporter I am. I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president. And while this isn t a direct endorsement, this should really come as no surprise. Last October, while interviewing Pharrell, the producer/singer let DeGeneres know that he would be supporting Hillary, and she responded with: We have become a society where it is all about personality and celebrity and charm, instead of it being about the person who s gonna get the job done. And while we still don t know who is going to win the Democratic primary, let alone who will win the White House, Hillary definitely has the experience, know how, and wherewithal to get the job. She s seen and dealt with it all throughout her tenure in Washington DC. That being said, Bernie Sanders would still make a very formidable candidate, and honestly either candidate would be heads above any Republican candidate.Here s DeGeneres speaking with Clinton: // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt; I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president.  -Ellen DeGeneresPosted by Hillary Clinton on Monday, January 11, 2016Video/Featured image: Facebook",News,"January 12, 2016"
WATCH: TUCKER CARLSON DESTROYS Leftist Professor Who Claims “It’s a privilege to teach future DEAD COPS” and Defends Antifa’s Right To Beat Their Opponents,"This is just one of literally thousands of liberal activists who are being paid to teach our youth. Let that sink in The head of the city s largest police union is calling for the firing of a John Jay College professor after he tweeted  it s a privilege to teach future dead cops. Professor Michael Isaacson, a self-proclaimed member of the Antifa movement who works in the economics department at the CUNY Manhattan college, tweeted from the account @VulgarEconomics:  Some of ya ll might think it sucks being an anti-fascist teaching at John Jay College but I think it s a privilege to teach future dead cops  on Aug. 23.Patrolmen s Benevolent Association boss Pat Lynch wrote a letter saying Isaacson  harbors total disdain for the active and future police officers that he teaches at John Jay College. In a Friday letter to Karol Mason, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Lynch demanded the  immediate dismissal  of Isaacson  on behalf of nearly 50,000 active and retired New York City police officers who are members of the Patrolmen s Benevolent Association of the City of New York. Recent media reports have revealed Mr. Isaacson s disgusting anti-police attitudes and his gleeful embrace of political violence, including violence against police officers, as expressed in his own social media postings,  Lynch wrote.Lynch continued:  It is absolutely outrageous that an individual who holds and expresses these views could be employed by any academic institution, much less one that counts an overwhelming number of New York City police officers as among its students, alumni and faculty members. He wrote that Isaacson s  continued presence will make it next to impossible for John Jay College to maintain any respect or credibility among the women and men who have dedicated their lives protecting this city, or among prospective students considering a law enforcement career.

 Trump Brings Us DANGEROUSLY Close To State-Run Media Before His Administration Is Even Chosen,"Trump has just made his campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, his new chief strategist, and that doesn t bode well for anybody who might hold out some hope that Trump doesn t have fascist tendencies. Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, and Breitbart is positively reveling in Trump s win. They feel it gives them legitimacy, and Bannon s placement gives them unprecedented access to and influence over a presidential administration.The New York Times published a report on this, and Alexander Marlow, Breitbart s editor-in-chief, told them: So much of the media mocked us, laughed at us, called us all sorts of names. And then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president, despite all of that hatred, is something that we certainly enjoy, and savor. They re thrilled now because they think this makes them legitimate. What they apparently don t see is that people laughed at and dismissed Breitbart because they became an alt-right conspiracy site, as opposed to a legit conservative media site. They want to shape narratives like everyone else, but Bannon s dictatorial rule turned them into just another InfoWars. His placement on the transition team (along with the blowjobs he probably gave Trump in order to get on the campaign) makes this dangerous.It opens a very wide door to a state-run media outlet. Throughout his entire campaign, Trump vilified any media outlet that dared criticize him. He openly and repeatedly claimed to want to open up libel laws so it would be easier to sue outlets for saying bad things about him. He only liked media outlets that gave him favorable coverage, and he wanted to burn any outlet that didn t.Make no mistake, this is a reason to be nervous. State-run media is nothing more than a government s propaganda arm, and Breitbart s newfound fame reaches a lot of people. They re even talking about expanding into Paris, Cairo, and Berlin, according to the Times report.State-run media uses a variety of methods to control information, and one that could become true here very quickly is known as  the big lie.  What is  the big lie?  According to North Korea s media, for instance, it s the idea that there s no poverty and everyone would have laid down their life for their late dictator, Kim Jong Il. The  media  even claimed that people ran into buildings damaged by a munitions explosion to save paintings of Kim before they tried saving their own family members.Who believes that actually happened and that North Korea is so prosperous under the Kims that there s no poverty? Really.Yet, Breitbart already does things like this, too. They ran unsubstantiated rumors about Hillary Clinton s health; they ve claimed the rash of hate crimes since Election Night is  fake,  and they turned their backs on one of their own reporters, Michelle Fields, after Corey Lewandowski grabbed and bruised her.Furthermore, Mike Pence himself tried to start a state-run media outlet in Indiana. He wanted it to compete with Indiana s independent media. They would even  break  stories ahead of everyone else, most likely to shape the narrative before the mainstream media had a crack at it. There s a good chance he d be on board with Breitbart being the administration s own personal propaganda machine.Then there s the liar of liars himself. Trump just lied about The New York Times again after a campaign filled with these lies:@realDonaldTrump @nytimes fact: surge in new subscriptions, print & digital, with trends, stops & starts, 4 X better than normal.  NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016Breitbart can easily start pushing these lies, too, and anything else they see fit. Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who quit earlier this year, voiced worry over the idea that Breitbart was suddenly so close to the White House: It will be as close as we are ever going to have   hopefully   to a state-run media enterprise. Think it really can t happen, because we re already full of independent journalism along with a Constitutional right to a free press? Think again. The Times floated this small fact in their report: [T]he site s influence on social media, where more and more Americans now consume information, has been palpable. On election night, Breitbart s Facebook page received the fourth-highest number of user interactions on the entire platform   beating Fox News, CNN and The New York Times. If they get big enough and command a large enough audience, other media outlets could fade to irrelevance. It snowballs from there. Of course, The Times says that Breitbart s editor-in-chief totally rejects the idea that they could become Trump s own propaganda mill, which is baloney: Our loyalty is not going to be to Donald Trump; our loyalty is to our readers and to our values. That s regardless of what role Steve has.If Trump runs his administration and honors the voters who voted him in, we re all good. But if he is going to turn his back on those values and principles that drove his voters to the polls, we re going to be highly critical. We re not going to think twice about it. Trump and Bannon can quietly use Breitbart to push whatever they want. They can use its propaganda to counter what the mainstream media is saying, and people will buy it up lock, stock and barrel.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 14, 2016"
 The RNC Has Made Itself The De Facto Judge And Jury Of America,"We all knew the 2016 Republican National Convention would be a Hillary hate fest. For the past three days, Republicans have given the voters not one reason to vote for them, but many reasons why they shouldn t vote for Hillary Clinton.No substance, only an us-against-them mentality. This shouldn t come as a shock to anyone.But what has come as a shock is that the RNC has crowned itself as the de facto judge and jury of America. Not only was it a Hillary hate fest, it was a hyper-partisan witch hunt that transcends anything we ve seen in presidential politics.While their presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, paints himself (humorously) as the  law and order  candidate, speaker after speaker, from General Michael Flynn, to Patricia Smith, to Chris Christie, have decided to take the law into their own hand, and convict Hillary Clinton of egregious crimes. They are, in their minds, the judge and jury that will convict Hillary Clinton, courts be damned.No matter how many times they scream  guilty,   lock her up,  or  Hillary for prison,  they know, as much as anyone else, that Clinton is innocent. Since the 1990s, when Ken Starr and his band of ideological thugs (including Newt Gingrich), Republicans have never been able to successfully pin anything on Hillary Clinton. Not Rose Law Firm, not Whitewater, not Benghazi, and not her emails. Yet they have convinced themselves that they know better than the law, and they know better than the judges, juries, prosecutors and special counsels that have spent countless hours   no, years   trying to find something, anything, to convict Hillary Clinton of.Republicans know what they re doing. It s pure political theater. It s tidbit SoundBits that stick in voters  minds and fester until election day, polluting the electorate s ability to look at the facts in an objective, impartial manner. They know they can t really convict her, but if they can convince the people that they re right and the law is wrong, that s good enough for them.But in the eyes of the Republicans, whose only goal is to win and not govern, the court of public opinion is mightier than the courts that uphold the rule of law.There is no law and order with Republicans. That s just a talking point they use when they want to stop black people from having their voices heard or when they don t like the Supreme Court granting marriage rights to same-sex couples.These instances, coupled with their sophomoric chants at their coveted convention, shows one thing: Republicans do not respect the law. They do not respect the institutions thatAl Franken is right.  Lock her up  has become a banana republic for the GOP. They have no substance to run on. Hillary Clinton is their main topic, and their world s revolve around her. It s actually quite pathetic not just on the surface but also deep down. They know they can t win with their ideas, so they must rely on smearing others.The Democratic convention can t come fast enough.Featured image via Jeff J.

 Dallas Morning News Endorses Hillary Clinton – The First Democrat In 75 Years,"Something big happened in Texas, and Hillary Clinton is going to love it.The Dallas Morning News, a highly conservative publication that has always supported Republicans, made the shocking announcement they would not be endorsing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and instead threw their support behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Here s why that s a big deal.The paper, which made its endorsement Wednesday morning, wrote that the decision was not easily reached, but acknowledged the significance:This newspaper has not recommended a Democrat for the nation s highest office since before World War II   if you re counting, that s more than 75 years and nearly 20 elections. The party s over-reliance on government and regulation to remedy the country s ills is at odds with our belief in private-sector ingenuity and innovation. Our values are more about individual liberty, free markets and a strong national defense.We ve been critical of Clinton s handling of certain issues in the past. But unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has experience in actual governance, a record of service and a willingness to delve into real policy.The only other time the News neglected to endorse a Republican was in 1964 when Barry Goldwater ran   although they did not endorse Lyndon B. Johnson.While the News was not head over heels for Clinton, chiding her for her  dodgy  nature and  her willingness to shade the truth,  the conclusion was made that her bipartisan approach to governing offered a stark contrast to Trump s campaign of  exploiting base instincts of xenophobia, racism and misogyny. Flying in the face of typical conservative speak, the News also shot down the ridiculous alt-right conspiracy theories that she is treasonous and a murderer. Avoiding the unnecessary gobbledygook that comes with Republican talking points (they referred to these people as  political hyenas ), the News finished with a straightforward appeal to its readers:After nearly four decades in the public spotlight, 25 of them on the national stage, Clinton is a known quantity. For all her warts, she is the candidate more likely to keep our nation safe, to protect American ideals and to work across the aisle to uphold the vital domestic institutions that rely on a competent, experienced president.Hillary Clinton has spent years in the trenches doing the hard work needed to prepare herself to lead our nation. In this race, at this time, she deserves your vote.And just like that, a Republican newspaper that never dared to endorse a Democrat has endorsed arguably the most famous Democratic feminist this country has ever seen. Of course the readers were upset with the News, calling the editorial board  sellouts,   pathetic,   shameful,  etc. Some even accused DNC operatives of coercing or bribing the board to endorse Clinton.When Republicans feel threatened, they pounce. And the irony is so rich   the same  political hyenas  the News espoused as crazy conspiracy theorists are now flocking to their website, accusing them of being DNC or Clinton plants.You ve got to love what the Republicans have turned into. No wonder the News endorsed Clinton. And the timing is great. A recent Washington Post/SurveryMonkey poll has Clinton winning Texas by 1 point over Donald Trump.While not a Hillary Clinton love fest, the paper did show amazing courage in standing up for what is right, putting country before politics.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016"
" Ex-FBI Tears Trump To Pieces, Wonders ‘Who’s In Charge of This Country?’ (VIDEO)","All Americans, and indeed the entire world, should be very afraid of what is going on with Donald Trump s presidency. Many people have voiced those concerns publicly, and one of them is former FBI Special Agent Clinton Watts.On Friday, Watts appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump s threatening tweet directed at now-former FBI Director James Comey, and his remarks were most extraordinary. First, he addressed Trump s tweet. He s threatening somebody he already fired. He would make passive threats to the FBI Director via Twitter before he fired him. He s saying he might taping recordings of you to use against you later. It s not the rule of law, it s the rule of Trump. Watts then turned to the fact that Trump really doesn t seem to be running the nation at all. This is evident to anyone watching the chaos unfold on a daily basis, of course. He continued: He s obviously not working right now or in charge, he s sitting watching TV and tweeting. Who is in charge of this country? This is a different level of seriousness, in terms of this tweet this morning. This is getting more and more grave by the day. Trump is drunk with power and abusing it. The White House is in chaos, its spokespeople seem to have no idea what to say to the American public. Everyone in the administration lies routinely to the American public. And now, most grave of all, we have this out of control president threatening the man he just fired   a man who happened to be leading up an investigation into the president himself. The firing itself seems like obstruction of justice, and the threat is even worse.Congress, if ever there was a time for you to do your jobs and check and balance Donald Trump, it s now. This man is ripping our democracy apart before our very eyes, and you re sitting by and letting it happen.Watch Clint Watts rip Trump apart below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 12, 2017"
 Trump’s Revolting ‘Hot Mic’ Moment Has Just Blown His Campaign And The GOP To Bits (VIDEO),"Earlier today, an audio recording surfaced of Donald Trump talking about working really hard to fuck a married woman eight months after he married Melania. But this is about more than just a leaked extramarital affair; he actually tried to assault this woman and he bragged that he just starts kissing beautiful women, which is likewise sexual assault.His inner circle and surrogates don t know what to do with this.Mike Pence actually dodged his press pool and then disappeared when they asked him about it. Politico s Matthew Nussbaum got that on video and posted it to Twitter earlier today:My attempt to get Pence to respond to the Trump tape. He ignored the question. pic.twitter.com/jgv5rUJZIb  Matthew Nussbaum (@MatthewNussbaum) October 7, 2016Perhaps, when he s had a chance to calm down, he ll tell the press that Trump never said those things he said. He s good at that. Maybe he ll even say the audio was doctored, the Washington Post s David Farenthold obviously fabricated it, whatever. It ll be the only way that Mr. Mike Family Values Pence can deal with this without cracking up.One of Pence s campaign staffers said that his hasty departure with no comment to his press pool had nothing to do with this news. We call bullshit on that.Ben Carson, another staunch defender of  family values,  and who s one of Trump s surrogates now for whatever reason, said through his spokesman that this is no big deal, because everyone cheats on their spouse: You know, these things happen. I m sure somebody could find a video of Bill Clinton talking like this   are we gonna say Bill Clinton was the same person as president that he is today? Obviously not.People commit adultery. It happens. Ministers. Heads of state. Everyday people. People are human, they do human things. It s nothing unusual that somebody committed adultery on their spouse. Women do it. Men do it. Should we be shocked by it? No. The difference is that Republicans tried to argue, back in the day, that Bill Clinton s sexual escapades made him unfit to be President. They felt, at the time, that presidents should be held to a higher standard. Yet here s Ben Carson, a staunch evangelical and Republican, basically saying,  Eh. Everyone does it. So what? Others are not so quick to defend him, though. Paul Ryan, who had finally managed to swallow his bile enough to appear with Trump, disinvited him to the Wisconsin event tomorrow and will appear alone.He said: I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who has spent an awful lot of time defending Trump from various attacks since the July convention, blasted him: No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever. And one of his own campaign advisers said: This should have never happened. I wish it had never happened. I think I know that men talk this way sometimes, but it s nothing I would ever want to hear or condone or approve of. My reaction is   it s appalling. It s just flat out appalling. The adviser said,  Another day in Trump world I hate it. Trump s campaign did issue an apology, but it was lukewarm and backhanded and tried to deflect some of the backlash by saying Bill Clinton was probably worse.And so it goes. If Bill Clinton was unfit to serve because of his extramarital affairs, then what s Trump for sexually assaulting women and openly bragging about it? The GOP will never coalesce around a response for this.Featured image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016"
 Al Gore Has The PERFECT Piece Of Advice For Donald Trump,"Al Gore had hopes for Donald Trump at one time. He even met with him at Trump Tower, hoping he could influence the newly elected Trump to stay in the Paris Climate Accord. It failed, and Gore regrets the whole thing. I went to Trump Tower after the election,  said Gore, who was on Colbert s show to promote his new movie,  An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.   I thought that there was a chance he would come to his senses. But I was wrong. Source: Huffington PostNot only has Gore lost all hope for Trump on his most passionate issue, climate change, he s lost all hope for Trump altogether, and as a former Vice President, he has one piece of advice for the dumpster fire of a presidency, end it.  Resign. The interviewer asked if there was  one piece of advice  for Trump, what would it be? He responded:  Resign. Source: Washington ExaminerThis piece of advice came before last weekend s violent fascist march in Charlottesville, VA and before Trump insisted on siding with the Nazis, the KKK and other assorted heavily armed white supremacists. It was before Gore s latest movie, the sequel to his original climate change documentary ( An Inconvenient Truth ), called  An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,  which was released earlier in the month.A number of people and media outlets have been calling for Trump to resign.The Los Angeles Times said:If Trump won t resign, Congress should find a reason   any good reason   to impeach and remove himRolling Stone says,  Republicans Must Tell Trump to Go   Now.  Sadly, they aren t. While many have disavowed Trump s reaction to the Charlottesville violence and his support of the fascist fringe groups that make up a good portion of Trump s base, they are part of the Republican base as well, and Republicans need every vote they can get.Trump s biographer, Tony Schwartz, who was the real author of Trump s  The Art of the Deal,  has hope. He tweeted that trump will resign before the end of the year.The circle is closing at blinding speed. Trump is going to resign and declare victory before Mueller and congress leave him no choice.

" Numbskull Republican Ignores History, Says Reagan Would NEVER Negotiate With Iran","Republican Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) spoke with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins yesterday, on the radio show  Washington Watch,  where they discussed Obama s diplomatic victory in the peaceful release of Iranian prisoners.Perkins was very upset over the idea that we got Americans returned home by talking to Iran and using diplomacy. He suggested that America has hit a dangerously slippery slope in regards to Americans being held abroad in prisons, because the fact we did something to get our people home would only invite more and more demands in future incidents.Poe agreed that it was a very sad state of affairs for the nation. The  price  as he put it, that America had paid was simply too high. What price is acceptable, he didn t say. He only continued on to lament the fact that the days of Ronald Reagan and not negotiating with terrorists were gone from the country.Since he brought up Ronald Reagan and his policy of not negotiating with terrorists, let s take a closer look at that.During Reagan s second term, officials of his administration and very likely Reagan himself secretly and illegally sold weapons to Iran. Iran was under an arms embargo at the time because they were considered a terrorist state. The sale was done in order to bribe Iran to help facilitate the release of American hostages in Lebanon.The Republican revisionism and selective memory, when it comes to the legacy of Ronald Reagan is nothing short of amazing. The Iran-Contra scandal happened when practically every establishment Republican was alive and old enough to be able to watch the news or read the newspaper. It s like Germany insisting World War 2 never happened, and instead the entire nation was on vacation for 6 years.President Obama did everything right, getting our people home, not firing one bullet to do it, while not sending more weapons into the hands of those who can do us harm, and the first reaction from the right is to attack him for it.I m sure Republicans wish the prisoners were still being held so they had a political football, but can t they just try to repeal Obamacare again?[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242909973  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]featured image via YouTube screen capture",News,"January 20, 2016"

CHICAGO DELI OWNER Says He Was Relieved To Hear Las Vegas Massacre Happened At Country Music Festival: “White people shooting white people isn’t terror … it’s community outreach”,"Chicago Tribune   Just weeks after stoking controversy by using Nazi imagery on his Jewish deli s Facebook page, the co-owner of Max s Deli in Highland Park again has ignited outrage   this time with a tweet he fired off in response to the Las Vegas shootings. Soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief. White people shooting white people isn t terror   it s community outreach. #LasVegas,  the tweet read.Morelli attempted to apologize for his remark:Morelli, who described himself as politically  lost  with no allegiances, said his tweet about the deaths was thoughtless. It was a dumb joke and it didn t work. I own it. It was stupid,  Morelli said. It was seven in the morning and I was stressed out and freaked out by the shooting,  he added.  I was trying to participate, and all I did was put my foot in my mouth. But is he really sorry, or is he only doing damage control?  Only one month ago, Morelli posted this vile image on Max s Deli s Facebook page. Although Morelli admitted that after his post, his family, who were affected by his outrageous post, are  done  with him. Chicago Tribune   Highland Park deli is facing backlash over a Facebook post that includes a cartoon drawing of a man wearing a Nazi armband, giving a stiff-armed salute and donning a T-shirt reading,  I m with Alt-Right. Greg Morelli, who owns Max s Deli with his brother, posted the image last week. Morelli frequently posts the deli s menu along with cartoon drawings he creates to the restaurant s Facebook page. He said the recent events in Charlottesville inspired him to use the page to make a strong political statement. I have a Jewish deli, I am a Jewish man,  Morelli said.  I am the first person that s going to get a brick through the window if this plague is not stopped immediately. Morelli, 49, said the image was of an alt-right member who has hair evocative of President Donald Trump, but was not meant to be a depiction of the president himself.The full post and its related image are still on the deli s Facebook page.He said the deli was inundated with calls on Thursday as the post began to spread on Facebook and through news stories. Callers have been criticizing the post s imagery and its political message, he said.The effect of the post on his family has been difficult and Morelli says they are  done with him. When you create a storm, everyone that loves you just wants you to take the easy path,  he said.In a Facebook post on the restaurant s page Thursday evening, Morelli did not back down from the discussion the initial image provoked. I do not regret getting involved. I do not regret speaking out,  he wrote.  I do not regret assigning symbolism to hatred. I do not regret being trashed on Facebook. That said, it hurt. When asked about the specific use of Nazi imagery in the post and the reaction to not just his intended message, but the image itself, Morelli said the symbolism was a necessary point to make. We have to use the imagery and assign it to the groups so we know how to react,  Morelli said.  I happen to find satire very powerful. ",politics,"Oct 5, 2017"

BREAKING: SEAN HANNITY Interviews Wikileaks’ Julian Assange…Proves He’s Still Alive: “Our source is NOT the Russian government”,"The Democrats have 26 more days to discredit Donald J. Trump until he becomes our next President. They are really pulling out all of the stops. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange emerges from hiding to do an interview with Fox News  Sean Hannity in order to set the record straight on the DNC leaks he released prior to the election. It s interesting how mainstream media  reporters  have no interest in the content of those undisputed leaked emails, they only care about how they got into the hands of Julian Assange.Julian Assange has finally spoken out on the recent news about intel assessments on Russia being the source of hacking designed to reportedly help Donald Trump. Julian Assange spoke with Sean Hannity on his radio show this afternoon and stated,  Our source is not the Russian government.  He told Hannity WikiLeaks did receive a little bit of information having to do with Trump and the RNC, but  it was already public somewhere else. https://youtu.be/GJIVOsptcBsHannity applauded Assange and said he s  done us a favor  by 1) showing how weak U.S. cybersecurity is, and 2) exposing government corruption. He asked Assange if the information he received came from inside the United States. Assange did not say definitively, but insisted,  It has not come from a state party.  (At a later point in the interview, Assange said that info leaks from other places could have been from Russia.) Hannity also asked him if President Obama knows this too and is  purposefully  pushing a false narrative to delegitimize Trump. Assange said yes. On Thursday afternoon, Hannity, the Fox News host and informal Trump adviser, once again interviewed WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange this time on Hannity s nationally syndicated radio show. Hannity gave Assange a large platform to deny that the source of the DNC and John Podesta emails was the Russian government, and to also join Hannity in some fairly typical bashing of Hillary Clinton and the  liberal  mainstream media. Hannity gushed on-air. Thanks to Assange and WikiLeaks s work, Hannity said,  we can now fix the problem  of our gaps in U.S. cybersecurity. (The DNC and Podesta emails were a wake-up call, in a sense.) Assange also  exposed the corruption in our government  for all to see.  I have so many questions for you,  Hannity said, before reminding his audience of WikiLeaks s  perfect  record:  You have not been proven wrong, not one single time,  he reiterated. When asked if President Obama was trying to  delegitimize Donald Trump by promoting any evidence of Russian interference and cyberattacks aimed at helping Trump to defeat Clinton in the election) Assange answered firmly,  yes.   This wouldn t be the first time that the CIA would be politicized,  Hannity continued, making a Benghazi analogy. Assange also wagged his finger at  the liberal press  in America that tried to make Trump voters feel  ashamed  of themselves for supporting the Republican candidate.  What is the difference between what you and WikiLeaks have done, and what The New York Times and CNN [have done]?  the host inquired.  Our stuff has more impact,  Assange replied.  Touch ,  Hannity answered.  I can t disagree with that.  The conservative host continued to make the case that the so-called mainstream media was  trying to scapegoat  Assange, and that  if [Hillary] were a Republican they d be singing your praises day and night.   America owes you a debt of gratitude,  Hannity said, concluding their friendly chat.-YouTube copy and video provided by Jim Browski",politics,"Dec 15, 2016"

" Trump Lashes Out At CEOs, Suggests He’ll Replace Them With Ones Who Support His Racism","Donald Trump attacked the CEOs who are leaving his Manufacturing Council over his failure to condemn Nazis.In the days since his weak reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia in which he blamed both sides, three CEOs of major companies did the right thing by calling Trump out and stepping down from the council.Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier was the first to leave the council, drawing an attack from Trump. What made this particular situation worse is that Frazier is black and Trump attacked him just after refusing to condemn white nationalists.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was the next to resign, followed by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich.Of course, Trump feels personally insulted because he thinks anyone who works for him or with him should show him complete loyalty, even it that means supporting his racism and hate.And so, Trump accused the three CEOs of  grandstanding  and suggested he will replace them with CEOs who will be blindly loyal.For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!  Donald J.

 The Worst Environmental Disaster Since The BP Oil Spill Is Happening And The Media Is IGNORING It,"One of the largest environmental disasters in American history is happening right now, and there is a great chance that you never heard of it thanks to corporate-owned media.There is a colossal leak of methane gas currently pouring out of the ground in Aliso Canyon, California, at an astonishing rate of 110,000 pounds per hour. The fallout is intense. 1700 homes in the area have been evacuated so far, prompting many lawsuits to be filed against the corporation that owns the faciliy.Southern California Gas Company is the entity that s responsible for the disaster, which began in October of 2015. A statement by SCGC in December said that stopping the leak would take at least 2 more months.Below you can see video footage of just how bad the leak is:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exfJ8VPQDTY&w=420&h=315]The severity of this can t understated. This single leak is accounting for 25 percent of the entire state s methane emissions, and has been classified as the worst environmental disaster since the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas as well, marking this as a signicant ecological threat.Anne Silva, spokesperson for SCGC, made the following statement: Our efforts to stop the flow of gas by pumping fluids directly down the well have not yet been successful, so we have shifted our focus to stopping the leak through a relief well.The relief well process is on schedule to be completed by late February or late March. Source: MotherboardThe part that is making it so difficult to deal with, is the fact that the well is 8,000 feet deep. This is preventing the normal disaster recovery method of plugging the leak with fluids from working, due to too much pressure coming up from underground. The hope is that the relief well will drain off some pressure from the main well, allowing the fluid plug to work as intended.If you thought this was the only methane leak in California, you were wrong. The reality is far worse.In Pasadena, 35 miles from the Aliso Canyon leak, investigators found a cluster of leaks at 4 miles or less from each other. Below is a map of them, courtesy of Earth Defense Fund:Image credit: EDFWhere the hell is the accountability for this? The map above should be a criminal offense.The story of Southern California Gas Company is a pretty damning one. EDF has found that more than 38 percent of the methane pipes that SCGC manages are more than 50 years old, and 16 percent are made from sub standard materials prone to leaks and corrosion. Over 150 million pounds of methane have been released by the leak so far, and that isn t counting the huge cluster of leaks shown above.Lets put this into perspective. If 1700 families had to evacuate a California town because of volcano suddenly springing up, it would be everywhere in the media. There would be a nightly obsession over it on cable news. Politicians on every level would be pledging to help, and doing everything they can to hasten relief efforts.If we had a terrorist act that caused 1700 people to have to evacuate an American town, we would already be invading multiple middle eastern countries that had nothing to do with it.Instead, we have 1700 people displaced by an ecological disaster caused by a corporation, and the media response is  What disaster?

"OBAMA STONEWALLING ON Why He Sent 13 Payments Of $99,999,999.99 To Iran…Where Was Congress?","Leave it to the one and only Andrew McCarthy to put together a fantastic case against Obama and his lying administration when it comes to the latest race on the Treasury. This time it was a raid on a Treasury slush fund to give $1.3 billion to Iran. The Iran Deal is a great example of just how corrupt and dysfunctional our government is. Please take the time to read this incredible overview of the inner workings of giving billions to Iran It s UNREAL!The structured transfers of $1.3 billion from a Treasury slush fund remain shrouded in mystery.  Confidentiality ? Yes, that s the State Department s story on why the Obama administration is stonewalling the American people regarding the president s illegal and increasingly suspicious Iransom payoff. The administration refuses to divulge any further information about the $1.7 billion the president acknowledges paying the world s leading state sponsor of terrorism.Grilled on Wednesday about how Obama managed to pay the final $1.3 billion installment   particularly given the president s claim that it is not possible to send Tehran a check or wire-transfer   State Department spokesman Mark Toner decreed that the administration would continue  withholding this information  in order  to protect confidentiality. Whose confidentiality? The mullahs ? That of the intermediaries the president used? Whose privacy takes precedence over our right to know how Obama funneled our money to our enemies?The closest thing to an answer we have to the latest round of questions comes courtesy of the perseverance of the investigative journalist Claudia Rosett. (You weren t expecting the Republican Congress to be minding the purse, were you?) Recall that we have been asking about the $1.3 billion payment since the first revelations about this sordid affair. After all, if, as Obama and his toadies maintain, the payment is totally on the up and up   just a routine legal settlement involving Iran s own money   then why won t they answer basic questions about it? Why are such matters as the administration s process in tapping a congressionally appropriated funding source for the settlement   a settlement Congress did not approve and seems to be in the dark about paying for   being treated as if they were state secrets so sensitive you d need have a Clinton.mail account (or be a Russian hacker of a Clinton.mail account) to see them?Generally speaking, the State, Treasury, and Justice Departments cannot issue press releases fast enough to salute themselves over legal settlements that supposedly benefit taxpayers by billions of dollars   at least according to the same math that brought you all those Obamacare savings. How is it that, in what is purportedly a completely aboveboard legal case, we are not permitted to know how our own money was transferred to the jihadist plaintiff?With the administration taking the Fifth, it was left to Claudia to crawl through Leviathan s catacombs. In her New York Sun report on Monday, we learned that she hit pay dirt: stumbling upon a bizarre string of 13 identical money transfers of $99,999,999.99 each   yes, all of them one cent less than $100 million   paid out of an obscure Treasury Department stash known as the  Judgment Fund.  The transfers were made   to whom, it is not said   on January 19, just two days after the administration announced it had reached the $1.7 billion settlement with Iran. They aggregate to just 13 cents shy of $1.3 billion, the same amount the State Department claims Iran was owed in  interest  from the $400 million that our government had been holding since the shah deposited it in a failed arms deal just prior to the Khomeini revolution. So, stacked atop of the pallets of $400 million in foreign cash that Obama arranged to shuttle from Geneva to Tehran as ransom (or, as the administration prefers,  leverage ) for the release of American hostages   via an unmarked cargo plane belonging to Iran Air, a terrorist arm of the mullahs  terrorist coordinator, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps   we now have a second whopping money transfer that (a) violates federal criminal laws against providing things of value to Iran and (b) looks like it was conceived by Nicky Barnes.Read more: NRO",Government News,"Aug 27, 2016"
BRAVE FBI AGENTS Come Forward On Clinton Email Scandal: “Comey thought this was going to go away”,"FBI agents say the bureau is alarmed over Director James Comey s decision to not suggest that the Justice Department prosecute Hillary Clinton over her mishandling of classified information.According to an interview transcript given to The Daily Caller, provided by an intermediary who spoke to two federal agents with the bureau last Friday, agents are frustrated by Comey s leadership. This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have been convened, but was not. That is appalling,  an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision.  We talk about it in the office and don t know how Comey can keep going. The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton s house during the investigation. We didn t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,  he said. There should have been a complete search of their residence,  the agent pointed out.  That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire. Another special agent for the bureau who worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey s saying:  we  and  I ve been an investigator. After graduating from law school, Comey became a law clerk to a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan and later became an associate in a law firm in the city. After becoming a U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, Comey s career moved through the U.S. Attorney s Office until he became Deputy Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.After Bush left office, Comey entered the private sector and became general counsel and Senior Vice President for Lockheed Martin, among other private sector posts. President Barack Obama appointed him to FBI director in 2013 replacing out going-director Robert Mueller. Comey was never an investigator or special agent. The special agents are trained investigators and they are insulted that Comey included them in  collective we  statements in his testimony to imply that the SAs agreed that there was nothing there to prosecute,  the second agent said.  All the trained investigators agree that there is a lot to prosecuted but he stood in the way. He added,  The idea that [the Clinton/e-mail case] didn t go to a grand jury is ridiculous. According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova, more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at bureau and specifically the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena.DiGenova told WMAL radio s Drive at Five last week,  People are starting to talk. They re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked today to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away.

"EYE-OPENING: Why Liberals Won’t Talk About White, Poverty-Stricken, Rural Americans","This is a story you will never find in the mainstream media What seldom gets talked about and when it is, often with irreverent humor and contempt is the poverty of rural America, particularly rural white America: Appalachia, the Ozarks, the Mississippi Delta, the Dakotas, the Rio Grande Valley, the Cotton Belt.If you spend time among coastal liberals, it s not unusual to hear denigrating remarks made about poor  middle Americans  slip out of mouths that are otherwise forthcoming about the injustices of poverty and inequality.Yet, since the 1950s, Americans living in non-metropolitan counties have had a higher rate of poverty than those living in metropolitan areas. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, the poverty rate among rural-dwelling Americans is three percent higher than it is among urban-dwellers. In the South, the poorest region of the country, the rural-urban discrepancy is greatest around eight percent higher in non-metro areas than metro areas.Watch here, as Levi Holstein, 22 explains what Obama s shut down of the coal industry has done to his community: Holstein s youth was spent hunting deer,turkey and bears,fishing for catfish with his father and riding four wheelers through the hills of Boone County. Now,the mountains he grew to love have been leveled in pursuit of coal,and their debris scraped into the hollow above his childhood home,destroying old haunts. I would be the first to tell you I hate strip mines. I hate it,I don t like it one bit,  Holstein said.  But at the same time it gives a man a job. Unfortunately, for 8 years we had a President who was committed to shutting down the coal industry in rural America, where primarily low income white families live.For Holstein,and many others throughout the region,the changes to the landscape and negative environmental impacts are weighed against paychecks to support their families. However,in the past few years career miners have seen their jobs vanish or move to other parts of the state.Once the most formidable industry in West Virginia,coal is progressively losing its economic dominance throughout Central Appalachia as production slows due to tightening pollution controls,greater availability of cheap natural gas and growing competition from other coal basins.From 2007 to 2012 West Virginia s annual coal production dropped by 31.7 million tons annually,falling over 20 percent,from 165.7 million to 129.5 million. Over half of that decline,17.9 million tons,came from Boone County,which until 2012 had long been the state s top producer.So why is the poverty of rural America largely unexamined, even avoided? There are a number of explanations.Rural and urban poverty are similar to the degree that both occur when people do not have access to jobs specifically ones that pay a living wage (i.e. enough to provide themselves and their dependents with basic necessities like food and shelter). Many of the causal factors for poverty, however, are exacerbated in remote areas where the job and labor markets are smaller and less diverse, and communities lack the human capital of city economies. Often a single industry (in some cases single employer) will dominate a vast region.The geographic distance between some rural communities and higher education institutions, as well as technical and vocational schools, is also a factor. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, 20 percent of non-metro residents complete their college degrees compared to 30 percent in metropolitan areas.Similarly, when it comes to providing social services in rural America, spatial challenges arise in making those services accessible and visible to a remote public. The repertoire of services available to [rural people] is smaller,  Lobao says. Her research indicates that 50 percent of metropolitan counties provide subsidies for emergency medical services, while only 30 percent of non-metro counties do. Similarly, 30 percent of metro counties make elder care available, but only 20 percent of non-metro counties do. And 25 percent of metro counties provide childcare care, but only 16 percent of non-metro countries do. Each of these deficits contributes to the higher rate of poverty that we see among the rural poor.Lisa Pruitt, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, studies the intersection of law and rural livelihoods. She also runs a site called the Legal Ruralism Blog, where she writes about the problem of rural American poverty. Pruitt grew up in a working-class rural Newton County in the Ozarks of northwest Arkansas. She tells Rural America In These Times that one important misconception about rural poverty is that it is an exclusively white problem. While the majority of rural Americans struggling with poverty are white, Pruitt says, the racial makeup of the rural poor is far more diverse than the image most Americans realize. We tend to associate rural poverty with whiteness,  Pruitt says.  When we think about rural poverty, most associations with rural poverty are with white populations and in fact, that is true to some extent but it s actually far from being monochromatic. The demographics of poverty in rural and urban America are quite similar. Though whites make up the majority of both metropolitan and non-metropolitan populations in the United States resulting in a higher numbers of whites living in poverty poverty rates throughout rural America are much higher among the rural minority population. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 40 percent of blacks living in non-metro counties fall below the poverty line, compared to 15 percent of whites. Poverty rates among non-metro Hispanics and American Indians are also considerably higher than they are among whites.This popular association between rural American poverty and whiteness is key to understanding why the media, and liberal America as a whole, doesn t talk about rural American poverty. While black poverty in the United States is attributed to the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, housing discrimination, incarceration, and other forms of institutionalized racism, we have no national narrative that explains white poverty. As a result, there is an implicit belief that whites who have benefited from all of the advantages that come with being white don t have a good reason to be poor. In other words, that when whites live in poverty, it is their fault, or even their choice.Since the 1960s, the current U.S. economic system has had as a constant feature 15 percent of the population living below the poverty line. For better or worse,  says Pruitt,  when we talk about poverty, we focus on black poverty, and we focus on Hispanic poverty. We ve collapsed our nation s poverty problem into our nation s racism problem and it leads us to turn a blind eye to rural poverty. One of Pruitt s overarching arguments is that this political polarization between the liberal mainstream and the rural poor is self-perpetuating, and will only worsen with time as the rural poor are  excluded from the pipeline to power. There is such a disconnect between the people in power in this country and the rural poor. It s a negative feedback loop,  says Pruitt.  If you re deciding who you are going to admit to Harvard and you see they grew up socio-economically disadvantaged from rural America, the knee-jerk reaction is,  We don t want those people among us. They re racist. They re uncouth. They re unsavory.   Though the left has all but cornered the subject of poverty and its myriad dimensions, the fact that rural Americans tend to espouse conservative positions on social issues like abortion and gay rights does not make the liberal media or Democratic candidates any more sympathetic to rural American poverty. And if the 2008 Presidential Election is any indicator, poor rural Americans, especially whites, feel increasingly at odds with liberal politics and liberal candidates. I think the assumption is that rural white voters are racist and illiberal and intolerant,  says Pruitt.  And so there are all sorts of incentives to distance ourselves for the Democratic presidential candidates to distances themselves from rural whites. I think that most rural white voters are pretty alienated from politics generally, and the Democratic Party in particular. Yet the left and working class rural Americans have many reasons to forge a stronger relationship specifically in challenging the authority of corporate America and growing the bargaining power of workers. Lobao, clearly frustrated, says rural sociologists have spent a lot of time thinking about how the left could appeal to rural Americans and often find themselves mired in  platitudes. The one thing that we could stress in terms of social values is the value of building community,  she said.    Do you like your community? Do you want to build it? Well why can t we?  We can try to emphasize building the community, you know, because people identify with their community whether they re Republican or Democrat.  Via: In These Times",left-news,"Jan 18, 2016"

 Nancy Pelosi BRILLIANTLY Points Out the Brutal FAIL In Trump’s Address To Congress (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s join address to Congress last night left much to be desired, and many Democratic leaders are absolutely disgusted by what they heard and witnessed from the undeserving POTUS.In response to Trump s pathetic speech, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has received the following statement, which blatantly calls Trump out for being untrustworthy and fake. Pelosi wrote: The President s speech was utterly disconnected from the cruel reality of his conduct. And she s absolutely right. Trump s speech was completely disconnected from what he has done so far, and Pelosi accurately assessed Trump s address as a  bait-and-switch assault on America.  She also brilliantly pointed out that Trump has yet to actually back up any of his campaign promises and proposals.Pelosi also called Trump out for  selling working people down the river to Wall Street  and for jeopardizing  the security of our country  and weakening  our fight against terror with his Administration s dangerous, incompetent and unconstitutional actions.  Those are harsh words, but they re absolutely true and reflect how the majority of Americans feel about Trump s first few weeks in the White House. At the end of her statement, Pelosi warned Trump that  Democrats will continue to lead the fight  against his disgusting rhetoric and harmful policies.Echoing Pelosi s statement, colleague Chuck Schumer also held a similar opinion of Trump s address to Congress:Unlike Trump, who is infamous for walking back and flip-flopping on his stances to please the masses, Pelosi only doubled down on her comments earlier this morning in an appearance on MSNBC s  Morning Joe .

NO! OBSCURE FUND OF BILLIONS To Be Used To “Shore Up” Obamacare,"The Obama administration is maneuvering to pay health insurers billions of dollars the government owes under the Affordable Care Act, through a move that could circumvent Congress and help shore up the president s signature legislative achievement before he leaves office.Justice Department officials have privately told several health plans suing over the unpaid money that they are eager to negotiate a broad settlement, which could end up offering payments to about 175 health plans selling coverage on ACA marketplaces, according to insurance executives and lawyers familiar with the talks.The payments most likely would draw from an obscure Treasury Department fund intended to cover federal legal claims, the executives and lawyers said. This approach would get around a recent congressional ban on the use of Health and Human Services money to pay the insurers.Read more: WaPo",politics,"Sep 30, 2016"

 Black Caucus Demands Action: Calls On Congress To Hold Gun Vote In Wake Of Dallas Tragedy,"Following the horrific tragedy in Dallas, Texas, the Congressional Black Caucus expressed grief, sorrow, and outrage at the deadly violence that took place after what had been a day of peaceful protests. Amid their messages of mourning and healing as a nation, members also demanded that congress finally hold a vote on several pieces of legislation that focus on tightening gun restrictions.Representative G.K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina and the chairman of the caucus, said that in the wake of the  despicable crimes  in Dallas, the Caucus was determined to continue  our fight to remove guns from the hands of terrorists and would-be criminals. We come to this place each week to represent our constituents who are in pain. As of June 30, just a few days ago, 491 Americans have been fatally shot by the police; most of those were African-American.Last night, despicable crimes were committed against Dallas police officers, and when the dust settled five of them were dead as a result of an organized execution by criminals who possess guns and use them to the extreme. And so the Congressional Black Caucus convenes today to say to America we are continuing our fight to remove guns from the hands of terrorists and would-be criminals.Democrats have been fighting for several pieces of legislation. These measures include an effort bolster mandatory background checks and  No Fly No Buy,  which would stop suspected terrorists on no-fly lists from being able to legally purchase guns. Republicans have staunchly refused to take any action on the measures.Republicans, what on Earth are you, why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence?  Mr. Butterfield said.  Why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence? Why not give it a hearing, give us a debate, give us an up-or-down vote on our legislation on gun violence? Why?Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, led last month s sit-in on the House floor over gun control legislation following the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando. He urged protesters to remain peaceful, preaching the non-violent ways of the Civil Rights movement, in which he was an influential leader.There s no room in our society for violence; we respect law enforcement. There needs to be greater training of law enforcement and sometimes I feel that maybe not only those of us that engage in nonviolent protest but police officers need to be taught the way of peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence, to respect the dignity and the worth of every human being.It doesn t matter whether black or white, Latino, Asian-American or Native American; we are one family living in one house. We must learn to live together as brothers and sisters. If not, we will perish as fools. We have too many guns. There has been too much violence. And we must act.Watch the Black Caucus demand congress hold a vote on gun control legislation here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"July 8, 2016"
 Donald Trump On Accusations Of Sexual Assault: Mexico Did It,"Donald Trump is backed into a corner. After he was caught on tape admitting to sexually assaulting women, surprise! several women have come out saying Trump sexually assaulted them. He s running out of defenses, so Trump turned to one of his old hits. He s blaming the accusations on the Mexicans. Well, one Mexican in particular: billionaire Carlos Slim.As early as Friday, Mr. Trump is planning to claim that Mr. Slim, as a shareholder of New York Times Co. and donor to the Clinton Foundation, has an interest in helping Hillary Clinton s campaign, according to a Trump adviser.Attacking the Mexican billionaire would allow Mr. Trump to hit several targets. He could slam the  failing  New York Times, which he says had to be  rescued  by a  foreigner    Mr. Slim, the adviser said.Source: VoxUnfortunately, this is how Trump sees the world. People are either with him or against him. Not surprisingly for the controversial land developer, Trump has made a lot of enemies, and it appears those enemies are spread throughout the world. That alone should disqualify him for the position that is in large part, diplomacy.Beyond that, though, this is a man who refuses to take responsibility for his own actions. He admitted on tape the he grabs women  by the pussy.  Why should it surprise anyone that he actually grabbed some? Here s a list of all the women who (so far) have accused Trump. Even if Trump is right that it s some sort of personal vendetta by the New York Times (he s not), reports have come out in the Daily Beast, from CBS News, from a People Magazine reporter, from the Palm Beach Post, from Rolling Stone, from BuzzFeed, from the Guardian, from Vanity Fair, from USA Today, from Jezebel, from the New Yorker and from the Washington Post.Gotta wonder how he s going to blame the Mexicans (or perhaps the Chinese) on all of these.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images.",News,"October 14, 2016"

" If You’re A Domestic Violence Victim In Mississippi, You Can’t Get Divorced","Few states in this country can compete with Mississippi when it comes to enacting legislation which significantly constricts the rights and liberties of women,the LGBT community, minorities, and other marginalized groups.Most recently a state senate bill, 2418,  failed to incorporate domestic violence as a justifiable reason for divorce. The state currently allows only 12 justifiable reasons to legally grant a divorce including impotency, adultery, alcoholism, and incurable mental illness among some of the reasons.According to a 2014 report conducted by the Violence Policy Center, Mississippi ranks 5th in the nation in the rate of women murdered by men. In the United States, a woman is beaten or assaulted every 9 seconds. One in three women have been victims of severe physical violence from an intimate partner as some point in their lifetime. A gun being present during a domestic violence situation, where in Mississippi there is virtually no gun control, increases the likelihood of a homicide by 500 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, domestic violence is the third leading cause of homelessness among families.Setting justifiable reasons to legally grant a divorce is already a ridiculous aspect, but rescinding domestic violence off the list of justifiable reasons gives the abusers in a relationship even more power to abuse and control their victim without any repercussions. Domestic violence is rarely an anomaly, rather it is a behavior pattern of an individual,   to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence. Mississippi has caught a lot of negative publicity recently, in addition to North Carolina and other southern states, which have either passed or attempted to pass discriminatory laws against the LGBT community. Mississippi s GOP is disgraceful and they seem bent on trying to get away with passing as many unconstitutional laws as possible.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 21, 2016"
 ICE Agent Spills: We’re Targeting Children For Detention ‘Because We Can’,"Trumpers are rejoicing over the escalating activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their wholly misguided belief that undocumented immigrants do nothing but sit here, in the U.S., illegally soaking up every dollar that should go to actual Americans. That mentality has spawned five squillion allegations about the behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has gotten increasingly brazen, and even abusive, since Trump s election.One ICE agent has apparently had enough, and he s speaking out. Jonathan Blitzer, a contributing writer to The New Yorker, got in touch with this agent (who would only allow these details to be published under condition of anonymity) who finds himself increasingly alarmed by the culture shift at the agency.He s particularly angry about ICE s specific targeting of children who entered the country as unaccompanied minors years ago. Those children were placed with families and allowed to attend school here, hopefully so they could make themselves into contributing members of society. He told Blitzer something shocking: That they re going after these children literally because they can, even though there s no real policy for what to do with them after they re rounded up. The plan is to take them back into custody, and then figure it out. I don t understand it. We re doing it because we can, and it bothers the hell out of me.The whole idea is targeting kids. I know that technically they meet the legal definition of being adults. Fine. But if they were my kids travelling in a foreign country, I wouldn t be O.K. with this. We re not doing what we tell people we do. If you look [at] next month, or at the end of this month, at the people in custody, it s people who ve been here for years. They re supposed to be in high school. This isn t some rookie who s only been with the agency for a few months or a year, and probably hasn t fully assimilated into the culture and become a cold-hearted, contemptuous, power-drunk officer. This is veteran officer who has been in federal immigration enforcement since the Clinton administration.He talks about what things were like before Trump: ICE used to look at the full circumstances of a deportation case before making decisions. He feels that the job of the agency is not to judge the people they re detaining, and yet, many ICE agents are doing just that now, and that s part of the problem. Their contempt is growing by leaps and bounds and it s affecting how the agency runs as a whole (which Trump fans no doubt love).While this particular agent was heavily critical of Obama and what he saw as micromanaging from Obama s administration, there s so much now that s gone that it s really no wonder individual agents seem hungry to arrest and remove as many people as possible   even if those people are children. It sounds like they re becoming single-minded about it.And this agent is also upset about the use of resources. Our immigration system is already badly clogged, and has been for a long time. ICE is pretty much intentionally making that worse. We still have to make decisions based on a responsible use of the government s resources you can t lock everybody up, We re putting more people into that overburdened system just because we can. There s just this school of thought that, well, we can do what we want. This is Trump s America. This is what the Trumpers want   they want  the other  gone and they don t care how it happens or who that  other  is, let alone what it s going to cost us. The fact that ICE is targeting children who were specifically placed with families here, and who should be attending high school now, is just flat-out vile. This is not America.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"July 24, 2017"
 BUSTED: Trump Fired A Woman For Saying THIS In His Boardroom (VIDEO),"Donald Trump thinks he should be president despite bragging about sexually assaulting women by grabbing them  by the p*ssy.  But he once fired a woman for saying something far less inflammatory in his boardroom.During the final moments of an episode of Celebrity Apprentice in 2010, Trump listened as professional wrestler, Maria Kanellis, blasted chef Curtis Stone for using her dressing room to take a  crap. The reason why I said you were so arrogant was because you came in our dressing room and you took a crap and left the stench in the room,  Kanellis said while seated in the boardroom facing Trump as his son, Donald Jr., looked on.Even though his behavior was completely inappropriate, Stone and Trump focused on Kanellis using the word  crap,  calling it  a little below the belt.  Trump also called her use of the word  disgusting  and  gross  before firing her for using locker room talk. This is my boardroom, it s not a locker room. Maria, you re fired. Here s the video via Twitter:Donald Trump in 2010:  This is my boardroom. It's not a locker room. Maria, you re fired.   \_( )_/  pic.twitter.com/UlsP9Xjg7F  The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 10, 2016As you can see, this is prime example of Trump s hypocrisy. Ever since audio of his outrageous remarks about groping women came to light on Friday, Trump and his team have been writing the remarks off as mere  locker room talk  that should have no bearing on the election.But unlike the celebrities in the boardroom, Donald Trump is trying to gain the highest office in the United States, so his remarks, especially his use of the word  p*ssy,  should absolutely be held against him. They reveal his lack of character and how he treats women, whereas saying the word  crap  is pretty damn harmless in comparison.Donald Trump literally fired Kanellis for saying  crap  in his own boardroom, but he thinks he should be hired by the American people as the new president, despite using a worse word to describe how he sexually assaults women. Trump is nothing more than a misogynist who holds women to a standard that he can t follow himself. Firing a woman for saying a word instead of firing the man who took a shit in her dressing room, uninvited, proves that Trump will not be able to treat women fairly in the White House, and that he would let male employees get away with bad behavior towards them.This is not the kind of person we need leading our country.Featured Image: Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 11, 2016"

" I Let A Pit Bull Near My Baby, And This Is What Happened (IMAGES)","This is a two-year-old American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT). Her name is Akamara.This is a human baby. His name is Siegmund.Siegmund first met Akamara the day after he was born. We NEVER leave Siegmund alone with Akamara   after all, she s dangerous to him. She might quite literally snuggle him to death! Here s what happens:She gets pretty sad about it, but she s only allowed to put her head near him, and only with eyes on her at all times. He s just too small and she s too insistently snuggly.She really wants to lay on that pillow.Nothing to see here, just a ferocious pit bull trying to cuddle with a two-day-old baby.He s almost two weeks old now, and she s getting pretty impatient about it. Why isn t he petting her? Why will he not play tug?Akamara really can t help but cuddle the baby. It s her instinct! Little known to most people, but American Pit Bull Terriers   one of several breeds commonly referred to under the broad title  pit bulls    are nanny dogs. As the United Kennel Club (UKC), which recognizes and classifies APBTs as a breed, states in their breed standard:  APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. They make bad guard dogs, by the way   they re too friendly. Friendlier than you d believe. The American Temperament Test Society rates them higher than many common family breeds, such as golden retrievers! Here s an interesting video by Animalist on pit bulls:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Dogfighting has existed probably since humans domesticated dogs, and has flourished during the last century as an underground sport. Pit bulls are favored for a number of reasons, but that s not their fault, and it certainly isn t due to their temperament. It s because they bite hard, and when you factor in their size, they bite extremely hard.You can take a territorial, defensive dog   a normal personality type across most breeds, which requires socialization and training as a pup to deter aggression   and turn them into a fighter. It s criminal, but possible. And those dogs, if rescued, may suffer from PTSD or other mental trauma that increases the chances of an attack, especially if rescued by an inexperienced or unprepared owner. But it s not the breed. It s the choice by dog fighters to use the breed. Even if you restrict the breed, they ll find another.If it came down to it, dogfighters would probably pit chihuahuas against each other. It s the sport and the blood. It s the breeders and fighters, not the dogs. We don t put city-wide bans on cars that can go over 50 mph because a few people are souping them up and racing them. We arrest the racers and take their misused cars away.Akamara is a rescue, but a victim of only neglect. I got her at six months old with mange, no inoculations, and a desperate need for attention. Her immune system was extremely deficient due to mange and allergies, and she s struggled with secondary ear infections her entire young life. I would not advise rescuing an adult dog with unknown history in a house with children.Just remember, this isn t what most pit bulls look like:This is:",News,"February 17, 2016"
 Megyn Kelly Called Trump A ‘Predator’; What Newt Gingrich Said Next Was DISGUSTING (VIDEO),"It s Fox News, but that doesn t mean that everyone is blindly following Donald Trump. Anchor Megyn Kelly fell off the Trump train right about the time of the first Republican presidential debate of the season, after which Trump accused Kelly of having  blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,  all because she dared ask about Trump s history of sexism.It s been more than a year since that debate, and in that time, Trump the sexist has come front and center, especially after Trump was caught on a hot mic, saying that he likes to grab women  by the pussy,  and to confirm Trump s own words, nearly a dozen women are now accusing the self-described billionaire of sexual misconduct.Kelly, when interviewing Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, suggested that Trump is a  sexual predator.  At that point, the interview went off the rails. Gingrich became very angry and said to Kelly,Kelly responded in the best way possible,  I m not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by the protection of women and what we are getting in the oval office. Every woman knows that when a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  he s not saying it in a way that means she d be welcome in Trump s locker room   not at all. When a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  especially in an argumentative context, he s calling her a whore. While that statement might not have the same bite in 2016 that it might have had when Gingrich was young, the intent is there. Gingrich is trying to discredit Kelly in the exact same way that Trump is trying to discredit his alleged victims. A woman liking sex is still used as a defense in rape trials. While men grabbing pussy, or talking about grabbing pussy, is just boys being boys. Women talking about sex is taboo and any woman who dares talk about sex deserve whatever they have coming to them.Believe it or not, that exchange was the most rational part. In the now familiar Trump tactic of  I know you are but what am I,  Gingrich went on to call Bill Clinton a  sexual predator.  He even tried subtly bullying Kelly into  say(ing) the words,  Bill Clinton sexual predator.' Kelly went on to say that on her show, they ve covered the Bill Clinton story and that she s interviewed Kathleen Willey, who has accused Clinton of rape (an accusation for which a grand jury found insufficient evidence).Here s the video:Gingrich has a grudge against Clinton, to be sure. If you recall, the former Speaker of the House was one of architects of the Clinton impeachment, which only served to boost Clinton s popularity while it seriously hurt Congress s.Ironically, Gingrich and the other two Speakers who presided during the impeachment investigation and trials, were all sexual predators. Dennis Hastert molested boys while a wrestling coach in Illinois and Bob Livingston had a string of affairs. Gingrich was cheating on his second wife. Before that, though, Gingrich earned the title of sexual predator, at least that s what he s accused of:One former aide describes approaching a car with Gingrich s daughters in hand, only to find the candidate with a woman, her head buried in his lap. The aide quickly turned and led the girls away. Another former friend maintains that Gingrich repeatedly made sexual advances to her when her husband was out of town. On one occasion, he visited under the guise of comforting her after the death of a relative, and instead tried to seduce her. In certain circles in the mid-1970s, Gingrich was developing a reputation as a ladies  man.Source: SalonOh, and he also served his first wife her divorce papers while she was recovering from cancer surgery.

 Texas Father Disowns Teenage Daughter For Her ‘Sickening’ Interracial Relationship (TWEETS),"It has been nearly fifty years since the landmark Supreme Court ruling, Loving v. Virginia, that made interracial marriages (relationships) legal in the United States, but apparently some people are unaware of the ruling. A teenager in Texas recently tweeted an infuriating letter from her dad explaining the reason why he s disowning her: the relationship she was in with an African-American male.Stephanie Hicks, 19, is dating a black male and apparently this pissed her father off so much that he disowned her. In a letter she posted on Twitter, her father says: My belief is that interracial relationships are despicable. Vulgar and reprehensible. There s nothing worse than a half-black, and I m crushed that my own daughter has entered into such a disgusting relationship Mistakes can be forgiven, but you have willingly and consciously chosen a lifestyle of sickening choices, and I won t tolerate it. Her father then tells her that is she does not break up with her boyfriend, Nike, that she is not welcome in his life any longer: If you choose this black kid over your parents fill [suitcases] up and leave my house Change your name as soon as possible, because I won t have any association with you. Ever. First of all, as a parent, I am disgusted by this piece of garbage who has the audacity to call himself  Dad.  If he s are willing to disown his child over who they are dating, he never had any business raising a kid in the first place.Secondly, it is 2016 and no matter how much the GOP would like us all to believe racism is dead, it is clearly alive and thriving in the state of Texas. Her father called her relationship  sickening  but the only thing sickening about any of this is that guy s vile, hatred for a person because of the melanin he has in his skin. It is sad that this is even a battle that needs to be fought still, but it does.Like Stephanie, I am super white. I m so white that you could all use me to guide your way through a dark forest and my husband isn t white at all. I also live in the South, just like her and know what it is like to have people stare at me with disgust because my husband and child are naturally tan. Seriously. In 2016.America really has changed that much in the last fifty years because we have an entire political party that campaigns on platforms of racism and hate   hell, just look at Donald Trump. And this is going to continue to be a problem until we all step up and fight back. That means that we all have to vote for progressive candidates who want to move this country forward, not back.Hopefully, Stephanie takes this and uses it to become an even stronger human being.

NEOCON FILES: The Kagans Are Back – Wars to Follow,"Consortium News Exclusive: The neocon royalty Kagans are counting on Democrats and liberals to be the foot soldiers in the new neocon campaign to push Republicans and President Trump into more  regime change  wars  Robert Perry Consortium News The Kagan family, America s neoconservative aristocracy, has reemerged having recovered from the letdown over not gaining its expected influence from the election of Hillary Clinton and from its loss of official power at the start of the Trump presidency.Back pontificating on prominent op-ed pages, the Family Kagan now is pushing for an expanded U.S. military invasion of Syria and baiting Republicans for not joining more enthusiastically in the anti-Russian witch hunt over Moscow s alleged help in electing Donald Trump.In a Washington Post op-ed on March 7, Robert Kagan (photo,left), a co-founder of the Project for the New American Century and a key architect of the Iraq War, jabbed at Republicans for serving as  Russia s accomplices after the fact  by not investigating more aggressively.Then, Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the neocon American Enterprise Institute, and his wife, Kimberly Kagan, president of her own think tank, Institute for the Study of War, touted the idea of a bigger U.S. invasion of Syria in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on March 15.Yet, as much standing as the Kagans retain in Official Washington s world of think tanks and op-ed placements, they remain mostly outside the new Trump-era power centers looking in, although they seem to have detected a door being forced open.Still, a year ago, their prospects looked much brighter. They could pick from a large field of neocon-oriented Republican presidential contenders or   like Robert Kagan   they could support the establishment Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, whose  liberal interventionism  matched closely with neoconservatism, differing only slightly in the rationalizations used for justifying wars and more wars.There was also hope that a President Hillary Clinton would recognize how sympatico the liberal hawks and the neocons were by promoting Robert Kagan s neocon wife, Victoria Nuland (photo, left), from Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs to Secretary of State.Then, there would have been a powerful momentum for both increasing the U.S. military intervention in Syria and escalating the New Cold War with Russia, putting  regime change  back on the agenda for those two countries. So, early last year, the possibilities seemed endless for the Family Kagan to flex their muscles and make lots of money.A Family BusinessAs I noted two years ago in an article entitled  A Family Business of Perpetual War :  Neoconservative pundit Robert Kagan and his wife, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, run a remarkable family business: she has sparked a hot war in Ukraine and helped launch Cold War II with Russia and he steps in to demand that Congress jack up military spending so America can meet these new security threats. This extraordinary husband-and-wife duo makes quite a one-two punch for the Military-Industrial Complex, an inside-outside team that creates the need for more military spending, applies political pressure to ensure higher appropriations, and watches as thankful weapons manufacturers lavish grants on like-minded hawkish Washington think tanks. Not only does the broader community of neoconservatives stand to benefit but so do other members of the Kagan clan, including Robert s brother Frederick at the American Enterprise Institute and his wife Kimberly, who runs her own shop called the Institute for the Study of War. But things didn t quite turn out as the Kagans had drawn them up. The neocon Republicans stumbled through the GOP primaries losing out to Donald Trump and then   after Hillary Clinton muscled aside Sen. Bernie Sanders to claim the Democratic nomination   she fumbled away the general election to Trump.After his surprising victory, Trump   for all his many shortcomings   recognized that the neocons were not his friends and mostly left them out in the cold. Nuland not only lost her politically appointed job as Assistant Secretary but resigned from the Foreign Service, too Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE NEOCON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NeoCon FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"March 17, 2017"

MN: SOMALI MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS Explain Why It’s Acceptable To Kill Anyone Who Insults Mohammed [VIDEO],"Ami Horowitz is a thought provoking filmmaker who took a lot of heat for exposing the truth about the horrific, violent  no-go zones  in Sweden in one of his recent documentary films. Horowitz is also very controversial because he doesn t shy away from asking tough questions of the people he randomly interviews on the streets.In fiscal year 2014, Minnesota took in 2,232 refugees, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. Almost half of those were from Somalia.In the video below, Ami took to the streets in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN to talk a variety of Somali Muslim immigrants. Ami posed several questions to a large variety of random Somali Muslim immigrants. He asked young boys, teenagers, middle-aged men and even an older woman their thoughts on how they felt about living in the United States, and if they d rather living back in Somalia. Horowitz also asked if they would prefer to live under Sharia Law or American laws. Their answers may surprise you.The most shocking part of the video however, comes near the end when Horowitz begins to discuss freedom of speech in America. While one of the men being interviewed talks about how great it is to be in America and to be afforded rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, every single Muslim respondent believed that free speech is great unless it involves criticizing the prophet Mohammed. Horowitz took his question a step further and asked if was okay for Muslims to use violence against someone who disparaged or insulted Mohammed. Every Muslim he asked, believed that using violence, including killing a person who criticized or mocked Mohammed, would be justified.Watch:After a major dip in 2008, the year ly num bers of new So ma li refu gees in Minnesota have re bounded stead i ly.

Hillary Clinton Supporters Now Calling for a Recount of Votes in Battleground States," The person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened. 21st Century Wire says Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party s ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected).Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot.It s interesting reading past stories by  news  sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled,  Why the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton  which lays out the case of Hillary s lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. Will Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?  howled CNN s Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply  Move On,  as they say?Of course, we now know that  journalists  like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign.As it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election  was the mainstream corporate media. More form the Guardian  John Swane The GuardianA growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers.The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton s campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved.The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. I m interested in verifying the vote,  said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting.  We need to have post-election ballot audits.  Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement.A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan s center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons.In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,  he said.The developments follow Clinton s surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election Continue this article at The GuardianREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files ",US_News,"November 23, 2016"
DEPLORABLE! CROOKED CLINTON’S Ask For Donations To Help Haiti Following Hurricane Matthew…After Using 2010 Earthquake Donations To Rob Them Blind [VIDEO],"Despite the media s best attempts to keep the truth hidden from the public, poor Haitian activists and a few honest journalists have managed to expose the truth about how the Clinton s and their  foundation  raped the poor island of Haiti. The Clinton s took billions from people around the world who trusted them to help the poorest of the poor, following a devastating hurricane in 2010. Here is what Haitians have to say about the  help  they got from the Clinton Foundation:Thanks to the media, who has largely hidden this story, Bill Clinton is able to once again make a shameless pitch the world, asking them to donate to the Clinton Foundation, so they can help the Haitians. There has never been a more shameless and selfish couple in public office in America. Here s Bill s pitch:In the wake of the devastating destruction to Haiti caused by Hurricane Matthew, President Bill Clinton took to Twitter and urged his six million-plus followers to go to the embattled Clinton Foundation to assist in relief efforts.Praying for everyone impacted by #HurricaneMatthew. Here's how you can help in Haiti: https://t.co/OX77AS2bT6  Bill Clinton (@billclinton) October 4, 2016 Praying for everyone impacted by #HurricaneMatthew. Here s how you can help in Haiti,  Clinton said his tweet, which linked to a Medium article, entitled,  Members of the Clinton Foundation Community Respond to Hurricane Matthew; Ways to Support. The last time tragedy struct the tiny Caribbean country, Bill and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   according to scores of enraged Haitians   used their billion dollar charity and leveraged their global connections to enrich themselves and their monied cronies.Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010   while 316,000 lifeless bodies lay buried under rubble, and while 300,000 Haitians suffered from injuries, with another 1.3 million displaced   the Clintons saw an opportunity to cash in.Watch here to see how the Clinton Foundation ripped off Haiti:https://youtu.be/nlS4SimQfv8Hillary Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, landed a lucrative and historically rare Haitian  gold exploitation permit,  while Clinton Foundation donors, including Digicel mobile phone company founder Denis O Brien, were winning multi-million dollar contracts that would siphon massive profits from the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.While then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s State Department was funneling billions in relief funds to rebuild Haiti, the Clinton Foundation was leveraging its influence to guide high-dollar contracts to longtime Clinton cronies who would go on to reap millions off the catastrophe that had claimed so many lives on the devastated island. I deal through the Clinton Foundation,  Tony Rodham said according to a transcript of his testimony during court proceedings, obtained by The New York Times.  That gets me in touch with the Haitian officials. I hound my brother-in-law [Bill Clinton], because it s his fund that we re going to get our money from. And he can t do it until the Haitian government does it. The anger at the Clintons from the Haitian people is no secret.Indeed, dozens of Haitian protesters gathered outside the Democrat National Convention in July and railed against the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation for their long-reported history of using their global connections to exploit the resources and the poor people of Haiti. The main message is that Hillary Clinton belongs in jail,  one protester said at the time when asked what the overall message of the protest was.  We believe that the world should know about the crimes the Clinton family has committed against the country of Haiti the money they have stolen from the earthquake victims. And we believe that were this to be anyone else, they d be in jail right now. She s not in jail because she s being protected by the Obama administration, the Justice Department, State Department,  the protester said. Via: Breitbart ",left-news,"Oct 7, 2016"
WOW! CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT Case Decides ‘Right to Vote On Taxes’,"Wow! The people of California might lose the right to vote on taxes? Only in California would this even be a possibility!Last week the California Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could determine whether the right to vote on local taxes, which is constitutionally guaranteed by both Propositions 13 and 218, will cease to exist.The case, California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland, at first glance seems limited to a narrow technical question: When a local initiative seeks to impose a new tax, does the issue need to be put to the voters at the next general election or can the proponents, relying on other laws, force a special election? But in answering that question, the lower court ruled that taxes proposed by initiative are exempt from the taxpayer protections contained in the state constitution, such as the provision dictating the timing of the election.The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (HJTA), which filed the petition seeking Supreme Court review, was alarmed because the constitution s taxpayer protections include the right to vote on taxes. If local initiatives are exempt from those protections, then public agencies could easily deny taxpayers their right to vote on taxes by colluding with outside interests to propose taxes in the form of an initiative, then adopting the initiative without an election.Via: iotw",Government News,"Jul 7, 2016"
 General Motors NAILS Trump For Lying After He Accuses Them Of Making Chevy Cruze In Mexico,"Donald Trump just attacked an American car company and got humiliated in response.In his first tweet of the day on Tuesday, Trump accused General Motors of manufacturing the Chevy Cruze in Mexico and shipping it across the border tax-free to sell in the United States. He then threatened them to make the car here or pay a huge tax penalty.General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.

Most Chevy Cruzes are made here in the United States by American workers.General Motors fired back at Trump in a statement. General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S. But as a result of Trump s accusations and threats General Motors  stock price tumbled briefly and then recovered. Keep in mind that General Motors was nearly wiped out of existence at the beginning of the Great Recession, which would have cost thousands of Americans their jobs. Trump s attack on General Motors could have harmed the company in a way that would have harmed American workers he the stock price fallen more than it did.And Americans were unforgiving on Twitter in response to Trump s bullshit and even called out the fact that GM CEO Mary Barra is one of Trump s economic advisers.@realDonaldTrump attacks on individuals companies are crony capitalism, with potentially devastating consequences. https://t.co/sUEgf4lLFI  Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump and isn t GM s chairman and chief executive, Mary Barra, one of your appointments to your economic advisory panel?

 Trump Supporters Terrorize An American Woman On The Subway For Wearing A Hijab,"Donald Trump s deplorable supporters strike again.18-year-old Yasmin Seweid was born in Brooklyn, New York. So she has been raised in America her entire life. She grew up surrounded by American culture and values religious freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution.And that is why she is able to wear a hijab and practice Islam.But while she was standing on the subway platform waiting to go home, three male Trump supporters targeted her and began harassing her. They called her a  terrorist,  ripped the straps on her bag, and tried to forcibly remove her hijab all while saying Trump s name.The abuse continued on the train and Seweid was forced to exit at an early stop in order to get away from them. Bystanders even watched the incident unfold and cowardly did nothing to stop it.She reported the incident to police, who are investigating the crime.In order to warn others about the dangers of Trump supporters, Seweid chose to write about her horrific experience on Facebook. I take the train every single day going to & coming from class, but yesterday, something happened that I never thought would happen to me,  Seweid wrote.  I was harassed on the subway last night and it was just so dehumanizing I can t speak about it without getting emotional. Three white racists ripped the straps off my bag & attempted to yank my hijab off my head. They yelled such disgusting slurs at me, I was so helpless and felt defenseless.  Look it s a fucking terrorist ,  go back to your country ,  take that rag off your head  and so many more. Trump s name was repeatedly said & it finally clicked in my head. No matter how  cultured  or  Americanized  I am, these people don t see me as an American.It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs.

Just thought I should share that with you all tonight.Here s her full post via Facebook.Ever since Election Day, Trump supporters have been celebrating by committing hate crimes against women and minorities. In fact, the number of hate crimes skyrocketed and nearly 900 of them have been committed in the weeks since November 8th. And experts say it is worse than the number of hate crimes committed after the 9/11 attacks.Donald Trump has done nothing more than create an atmosphere of hate and violence in this country. With that being said, his call for unity is complete bullshit. We can t have unity in this country when his own supporters are going around terrorizing people.Featured Image: Steve Pope/Getty Images",News,"December 3, 2016"
" Oklahoma Gun Range Refused Service To Muslim Man, Now He’s Giving Them What They Deserve","You d think in the year 2016 we d no longer have to deal with discrimination of this magnitude anymore, but alas, the nation is still filled with bigoted morons, so, we still have businesses refusing service to customers based upon, in this case, religion.The Oktaha, Oklahoma gun range  Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gun Range  (what a name) decided to prohibit 29-year-old Raja ee Fatihah from their establishment because he s a Muslim. And now the U.S Army reservist, who proudly serves his country despite being openly discriminated against by bigots, is throwing a much-deserved lawsuit back in their face.The gun range, quite openly, prohibits Muslims, as can be seen in the photo:Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gun Range via CAIRLittle did they realize that the person whom they banned from their establishment was none other than a board member in the Oklahoma chapter of the Muslim advocacy group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is the one who helped file the suit, and the legal director of the Oklahoma chapter, Brady Henderson perfectly stated: Whether the sign in question says  no Muslims  or whether it says  no coloreds  or whether it says  no women  or  no Christians  or  no Buddhists    it is just as un-American and fundamentally it is just as wrong. Fatihah said the range was fine and pleasant with him until he revealed that he was, in fact, Muslim. He said: At that point, they started treating me with suspicion. The ACLU released this as part of their press release: The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates Oklahoma s non-discrimination law as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids certain places of business from denying service to customers based on their race, color, religion, or national origin. Although the business is open to the general public, in July 2015, the owners posted a sign near the front entrance announcing that Muslims are not permitted at the facility and that the business is a  Muslim free establishment. There is no justification for a business denying people service based on religion,  said Fatihah.  I am a servant of my community in every respect, and as a proud American, I have enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve to protect this country. I should be afforded the same rights and privileges as anyone else. When Fatihah arrived at the business s main counter, owners required him to fill out a liability form and provide his name, address, and driver s license number  standard procedure for patrons seeking to use the gun range s facilities. However, after Fatihah identified himself as a Muslim, the owners armed themselves with handguns and demanded to know whether he was there to  commit an act of violence or as part of a  jihad.  Fatihah was then made to leave the gun range without receiving service. According to WBRZ: The Oklahoma store owner s attorney, Robert Muise, says Fatihah was denied service because he was belligerent, not because of his religion. However, if you look at the sign on the front door that reads plain as day, MUSLIM FREE ESTABLISHMENT,  it s hard to buy that story line. It will definitely be interesting to see how this lawsuit moves forward and if justice will be served.Featured image: Council on American-Islamic Relations via Mother Jones",News,"February 19, 2016"
"IMMIGRANT With Soros-Funded Education, Who Earned $1.5 Million Per Year as DC Lawyer, Flees To “Somewhere in Africa” After Wife Is Caught Collecting Over $100,00 In Welfare [VIDEO]","An Arlington woman was arrested this week and charged with four counts of welfare fraud for collecting over $100,000 in benefits   all while her husband was a high-earning attorney in D.C., police say.Police say a six-month investigation into Helen Agbapuruonwu, 41, found that the mother of four had collected benefits like food stamps and Medicaid assistance for the past six years. While Helen was collecting benefits, her husband, Fidelis Agbapuruonwu, was earning $1.5 million per year as a lawyer, according to court documents obtained by News4.In 2001, Fidelis received the prestigious Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship which helped pay his way through law school.The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans offers up to $90,000 for two years of graduate education. Paul Soros, older brother to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, created the fellowship program in 1998 to honor  the contributions of immigrants and children of immigrants to the United States,  and help fund graduate study for immigrants  who are poised to make significant contributions to US society, culture or their academic field. As a lawyer at Mayer Brown, Agbapuruonwu worked on a number financial and civil cases, according to a search of federal court records.In one of his cases, Agbapuruonwu assisted a pro bono team in 2011, which helped a woman from El Salvador win asylum in the U.S. from the  continuous and severe physical, emotional, and psychological abuse inflicted by her ex-boyfriend.

"OBAMA’S BACKDOOR GUN CONFISCATION: 260,000 VETERANS STRIPPED Of Second Amendment Rights","Obama s cowardly backdoor gun confiscation starts with those who ve risked their lives defending our rights.In what amounts to a backdoor gun grab, two Senate Republicans are demanding to know why the VA stripped 260,000 veterans of their Second Amendment rights.As of December, the VA has reported 260,381 individuals to the FBI as  mentally defective  and therefore not permitted to purchase a gun, Guns.com is reporting.U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa lawmaker who is currently the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, finds this unacceptable. Our military heroes risked their lives to protect and defend this country and all that we stand for, including our most basic constitutional rights,  said Grassley in a statement.  Now the very agency created to serve them is jeopardizing their Second Amendment rights through an erroneous reading of gun regulations. The VA s careless approach to our veterans  constitutional rights is disgraceful. In an effort to fix the issue, Grassley, along with Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., penned a letter to VA Secretary Robert McDonald last week and another to the subcommittee over the agency s funding, questioning the practice.Making a due process argument, the lawmakers argue the VA uses the fiduciary trustee status of a veteran to regulate firearms possession without ever seeking to find out if the service member is a danger to themselves or others. The use of the VA regulation, adopted for a totally unrelated purpose, is suspect, especially in light of the Supreme Court holding that the Second Amendment is a fundamental right,  reads the letter to McDonald.  That holding changed the legal calculus by which a regulatory scheme can survive constitutional scrutiny and it is not clear how these regulations would fare under that increased scrutiny.

 Watch Elizabeth Warren DESTROY Donald Trump in Epic Tweetstorm (TWEETS),"Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) lit into Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with a series of tweets. Warren hammered away at Trump, calling him a  loser  and accused him of engaging in  petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, flagrant narcissism. Warren is hugely popular and influential with Democrats and liberals, and her series of tweets targeting Trump is seen by some as a sign that the primary season is effectively over and that the general election has begun.Here are Warren s tweets:Let s be honest   @realDonaldTrump is a loser.

Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016The way I see it, it s our job to make sure @realDonaldTrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016Warren s tweets all hit at what are considered soft spots for Trump. He has boasted about his huge wealth, but numerous reports indicate that his net worth is considerably exaggerated. From Trump biographer Timothy O Brien:On a single day in August 2004, he told me his net worth was $4 billion to $5 billion, then revised that later the same day to $1.7 billion. Forbes said at the time he was worth $2.6 billion. A year later Donald told me he was worth $5 billion to $6 billion, but a brochure left on my nightstand at his Palm Beach resort said he was worth $9.5 billion.The tweets also discuss Trump s sexism, which appears to be one of his major Achilles  heels. When Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pointed out his history of demeaning women, he complained she was bleeding out of her  whatever,  and still months later has referred to her as  crazy,  which drew an uncharacteristic rebuke of a Republican from the right-wing propaganda network.Perhaps most importantly, Warren is indicating to the mainstream media and other Democrats that Trump s racially motivated campaign won t be off limits to criticism. So far, Republicans have largely avoided hitting Trump on his offensive language towards latinos and Muslims, as well as towards black activists (he called for protesters to be punched). The Democrats largely have no interest in courting the racists that dwell in the base of the GOP, and have no such restrictions on what they can say in the general election.It looks like the fight is truly on.Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 21, 2016"

John McCain (R-Ariz.) said American leadership was stronger under President Trump s predecessor, President Barack Obama, according to a Guardian report published Sunday.Asked if the country stood on sturdier ground under Obama s leadership, McCain said  yes,  according to the report. As far as American leadership is concerned, yes,  said McCain, who also vocally criticized many of the Obama administration s foreign policy decisions.For months, President Donald Trump has been trying to convince Cindy McCain a respected voice on refugees and other humanitarian issues and wife of Sen.

Now, it s a  done deal  for both parties, according to two senior administration officials.After months of being offered and rejecting several potential posts in the Trump administration, Cindy McCain and the president came to the agreement of a Washington, D.C.-based ambassador-at-large position, which would focus on anti human trafficking efforts, refugees, and humanitarian-aid matters.

 WATCH: Fox News Host Smacks Down Trump Supporter For Being A Hypocrite About Tax Returns,"Donald Trump still refuses to release his tax returns. So when Fox blowhard Eric Bolling tried to defend him for it he was utterly laid to waste by his own colleague.As usual, the panel of Fox hosts were busy trashing Hillary Clinton and attacking her over her recently released tax returns. But Bolling claimed that he cares more about the transcripts of Hillary Clinton s speeches to Goldman Sachs, remarking that he  really wants  to see them.Julie Roginsky then chimed in suggesting a trade in which Trump would release his tax returns in exchange for the release of the speech transcripts which drew approval from the panel. But Roginsky pointed out that she doesn t think Trump will do it because the New York Times reports that his tax returns will show that Trump pays zero percent in taxes while Clinton paid 43.2 percent in federal, state, and local taxes in 2015.In short, his tax returns would be embarrassing, and would spark outrage as it would be clear that Trump doesn t pay taxes while Hillary Clinton does.Roginsky s colleagues immediately jumped to Trump s defense by claiming that he can t release his taxes because he is being audited, but Roginsky didn t let that excuse fly. She pointed out that Trump is only being audited for a couple years of his taxes and said it doesn t stop him from releasing other years. In fact, an audit doesn t prevent releasing any tax returns at all even if they are under audit.Bolling, of course, continued making excuses for Trump and claimed that he can t release any of his taxes because the current audit could somehow affect his past returns. And that drew a sharp rebuke from Roginsky in which she called him out for being a total hypocrite. You are are coming up with Kool-Aid excuses! If this was Hillary Clinton, you d be the first to demand that she release those taxes. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, if Hillary refused to release her tax returns, Fox would immediately begin demanding that they be released and it would be a never ending topic from now till Election Day. But because Trump is the Republican nominee, Fox News has no problem defending him for refusing to release his own. That is except Julie Roginsky. She not only would like Trump to release them, she s tired of the lame excuses pushed by Trump apologists like Bolling.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 12, 2016"
 WATCH: George Stephanopoulos SHREDS Kellyanne Conway With Facts About Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Kellyanne Conway tried to baffle George Stephanopoulos with bullshit on Monday morning and got her ass handed to her with facts.Donald Trump s Muslim ban has caused worldwide chaos as airports across the country are detaining and blocking people traveling from seven countries, including green card holders who are permanent American citizens, children, and the elderly. For some reason, Trump and his team think these people are terrorism threats.But the ban not only violates constitutional rights, it is absolutely wrong about the seven countries listed because none of them are responsible for any deaths on American soil.And during an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Conway took a beating after she claimed that protesters against Trump s ban don t know the facts. I see all these protesters,  Conway whined.  I think if you actually surveyed them, they would probably get the facts wrong. They re being misinformed. Stephanopoulos then unleashed devastating facts, pointing out that Saudia Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates were left off the list even though those countries were home to the 9/11 hijackers. Trump mentioned 9/11 as a reason for the executive order. None of the deadly terror attacks in this country since 9/11 have been carried out by anyone from those seven countries. Eighteen of the 19 9/11 attackers came from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates   there is no ban from that country. Those countries also happen to be countries where President Trump has significant business interests. So why weren t those countries included? Conway responded by blaming President Obama, claiming that Obama banned Iraqi refugees for six months.But that s a lie because it appears there was only a delay in processing visa applications of Iraqi refugees in response to an actual threat. But there was no ban like Conway claims. Stephanopoulos even pointed out the inaccurate claim and informed Conway that there was a lot of media coverage at the time.Conway then whined about not getting bipartisan cooperation, which is quite hypocritical to expect since Republicans refused to work with President Obama for eight years. She also demanded that Democrats and Republicans collaborate with Trump on his tyrannical agenda, which she called an  extraordinary accomplishment. I mean, Donald Trump has been on the job for, what, eight, nine, ten days. Barack Obama was here for eight years. The extraordinary accomplishments in just the first week truly are breathtaking. No reductive curating reporting, in my view, is helpful to the American public to understand. We re being very collaborative and very open. We would just like the same in return.

An Egyptian court sentenced Mohamed Badie, leader of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and 13 other senior members of the group to death for inciting chaos and violence, and gave a life term to a U.S.-Egyptian citizen for ties to the Brotherhood.The men were among thousands of people detained after freely elected Islamist president Mohamed Mursi was toppled in 2013 by the military under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is now president.Sisi describes the Brotherhood as a major security threat. The group says it is committed to peaceful activism and had nothing to do with Islamist militant violence in Egypt since Mursi s fall following mass protests against his rule.Egypt s mass trials of Brotherhood members and people accused of links to the group, as well as its tough crackdown on Islamist and liberal opposition alike, have drawn international criticism of its judicial system and human rights record.The sentences, pronounced at a televised court session on Saturday, can be appealed before Egypt s highest civilian court in a process that could take years to reach a final verdict.U.S.-Egyptian citizen Mohamed Soltan was sentenced to life in jail for supporting the veteran Islamist movement and transmitting false news. He is the son of Brotherhood preacher Salah Soltan, who was among those sentenced to death.Mohamed Abdel-Mawgod, one of the defense lawyers, condemned the verdicts.  The court did not differentiate between the defendants and put them all in the same basket,  he told reporters at the courthouse. None of the defendants were present during the hearing.Badie is the Brotherhood s General Guide and has already been sentenced to several death and life sentences. His deputy Khairat El-Shater was given a life sentence on Saturday. OPERATIONS ROOM  TRIALRights groups say Egypt, where a popular uprising toppled veteran autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and started years of political turmoil, is now cracking down on all dissent. Sisi says stability is needed to revive the shattered economy.Rights advocates have criticized a U.S. decision to end a freeze on military aid to Cairo, saying Washington is putting human rights on the backburner. The United States has said the decision to end the freeze was in the interest of national security.Mohamed Soltan, 27, arrested in August 2013, had been on hunger strike while in prison. He deserves the punishment because of the money and instructions from the Brotherhood which were found with him, and for spreading chaos and horror in society,  presiding Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata told reporters.Sara Mohamed, a relative of the Soltan family, said they would appeal the verdict.  It was a farce trial of the first class None of the defendants attended the session,  she told Reuters by phone.A website calling for Mohamed Soltan s release says he was not a member of the Brotherhood, describing him as a U.S.-educated peace activist who was involved in youth events and charities. The website shows pictures of him lying emaciated on a stretcher while in detention.Saturday s case was known in local media as  The Rabaa Operations Room  trial. This is in reference to a sit-in at Rabaa square in 2013 in which hundreds of people protesting at the overthrow of Mursi were killed when security forces tried to clear the area by force.Cairo has defended its actions, saying it had given protesters the opportunity to leave peacefully and that armed elements within the Brotherhood initiated the violence.Saturday s session sentenced 51 people. Those who were not sentenced to death were given a life sentence. The long list of charges included leading and funding an outlawed group, overturning the constitution and planning to spread chaos, a court source said.Via: Reuters",Government News,"Apr 11, 2015"
BREAKING: Obama Threatens Great Britain With Trade Penalties If They Leave The EU,"ITV Reporter: British reporters in various degrees of politeness they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself. With that in mind, Mr. President, do you still think it was the right thing to intervene in this debate?  ANd what happens if the UK does decide in June to leave the European Union?Barack Obama: This is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make. I am not coming here to fix any votes  Maybe some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement but it s not going to happen anytime soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big block the European Union to get a trade agreement done. And the UK is going to be in the back of the queue. Not because we have a special relationship but because given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements is hugely inefficient.",Government News,"Apr 22, 2016"
RUSSIAN ROULETTE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT: Border Patrol Agents Given Awards For Putting Lives Of Armed Illegal Aliens Before Their Own,"Mind blowing incompetence and reckless disregard for the lives of these brave men and women by politically appointed leftists A new service award recently created by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for Border Patrol agents could actually put their lives at risk. The award recognizes an agent who does not use deadly force in a situation where they are confronted by an armed assailant.  They want us to put ourselves in a bad tactical situation,  National Border Patrol Council Vice President Shawn Moran told Breitbart Texas in an interview Friday evening.  This could lead to one of our agents getting killed. The award is defined by the CBP as:The Use of Deadly Force Encounter Averted award is to recognize and employee who demonstrated clear situational awareness and courage while disarming a suspect using contact controls and verbal commands before the situation escalated to the use of deadly force. The act must demonstrate courage in the face of an armed suspect and result in no injury in accordance with agencies use of force policy. At first, I thought this was a joke,  Moran told Breitbart Texas. But Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera contacted officials in the awards section of CBP and they confirmed it is true, he said. In addition to his Border Patrol duties Cabrera also serves as vice president of NBPC Local 3307 and as NBPC deputy spokesperson. This is a true indication about how the politically appointed leaders of the CBP truly feel about our agents,  he said.Moran said he had not heard about the award before Cabrera brought it to his attention.  I can t recall any official discussions between the union and the department over this,  he explained.  This is typical pandering by our executives to organizations like the ACLU and illegal alien advocates. The exacerbated leader of the NBPC which represents more than 18,000 men and women who protect our nation s borders said,  They are more concerned about placating these groups than protecting Border Patrol agents. He said this is also typical for them to roll something like this out on the day before a big holiday weekend hoping no one will notice.The policy appears to put just one more thing an agent must think about when faced with a life threatening situation.The NBPC posted a copy of the award definition on its Facebook page earlier on Friday evening. Commenting on the award, the organization posted,  This type of thinking will get Border Patrol agents killed. If that happens we will hold the creators of this award accountable. This is despicable. The CBP seems to be following the lead of the Los Angeles Police Department who rolled out a  Preservation of Life Award.  The policy was designed to recognize officers who hold their fire to avoid using deadly force, Breitbart News  William Bigelow reported in November 2015.The Los Angeles Police Protective League had a similar reaction to that of the NBPC. The local police union responded that the award prioritizes the lives of suspected criminals over the lives of officers.NATO forces in Europe considered a similar idea but never implemented it, Bigelow reported.

"HE’S BACK! He’s Got Investors Putting Up $12 MILLION And Plans To Make “Liberal Professors, Journalists Lives A Living Hell”","From the Vanity Fair article: Milo Yiannopoulos, the former tech editor at Breitbart, has made political provocations, often deeply offensive ones, a business model. But his career seemed to come crashing down in recent months when one of his speaking appearances, at the University of California, Berkeley, led to riots. Weeks later, videos emerged of Yiannopoulos seeming to condone pedophilia. ( I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst,  Yiannopoulos said in a statement on Facebook at the time.)Yet his allies turned on him. Yiannopoulos was subsequently forced out of Breitbart in disgrace. The American Conservative Union disinvited him from CPAC, and Simon & Schuster canceled a six-figure book deal.But as the free-speech conflagration he ignited at Berkeley continues to burn, Yiannopoulos is planning a way back in. Days after releasing a video touting his return to the campus, Yiannopoulos told the Hive that he would be launching a new media venture in the coming weeks with what he says is a $12 million investment from backers whose identities he is protecting. (Yiannopoulos showed me a page from the contract with the investors  names blacked out.) Another person involved with the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was similarly secretive:  Milo has the best instincts about these things,  he said.The business, which will be called Milo Inc., will be even more focused on stoking the sort of ugly political conflict that s closer to the surface of what can be best described as corporatized trolling via live entertainment, with Yiannopoulos and his investors hosting events featuring right-wing talent.  The business of Madonna became touring,  said Yiannopoulos in a phone interview, citing the artist s deal with Live Nation.  I m doing the same thing, but instead of signing up with Live Nation, I m building one. I m building it for libertarian and conservative comedians, writers, stand-up comics, intellectuals, you name it. This video pretty much sums up the truth about Milo and his free-speech rights being shut down by violent leftists:Milo Inc. s first event will be a return to the town that erupted in riots when he was invited to speak earlier this year. In fact, Yiannopoulos said that he is planning a  week-long celebration of free speech  near U.C. Berkeley, where a speech by his fellow campus agitator, Ann Coulter, was recently canceled after threats of violence. It will culminate in his bestowing something called the Mario Savio Award for Free Speech. (The son of Savio, one of the leaders of Berkeley s Free Speech movement during the mid-1960s, called the award  some kind of sick joke .)For the entire article: Vanity Fair ",left-news,"Apr 28, 2017"
FOR BERNIE SANDERS FANS: Prisoners Eating Cats To Survive In Socialist Venezuela,"When Other People s Money Runs Out An NGO operating in Venezuela has published videos of starved prisoners in the socialist nation killing, skinning, and cooking cats on aluminum pans in order to survive, as wardens have forbidden families from bringing food and serve only a small cup of rice and water per day.The NGO A Window for Liberty published the videos on their social media pages and have issued a statement condemning the Venezuelan government for human rights abuses against prisoners. The videos were smuggled out by relatives of those in multiple prisons across the country. According to NGO head Carlos Nieto Palma, relatives of inmates from at least four prisons denounced both the lack of food and various forms of physical abuse, including beatings with bats, chains, and heavy wet cloths.The video and photos published by the NGO are from the Centro Penitenciario Metropolitano Yare 3 prison in the northern state of Miranda. Miranda is an opposition stronghold governed by former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski. Relatives of inmates at a different prison in Lara state have protested that they have been banned from bringing food to the inmates despite the fact that the government has claimed the current economic crisis makes it difficult for the state to pay for sufficient food for the inmates.The video of inmates preparing their protein has been posted to Youtube. ****Warning: Graphic****https://youtu.be/d5vQZmky900The NGO also published photos following the skinning of the cat showing how inmates use a makeshift  stove  made out of aluminum foil and what appears to be a match to cook the meat:Reclusos de todo el pa s pasan hambre por falta de alimentaci n en recintos carcelariosLa organizaci n no Posted by UNA VENTANA A LA LIBERTAD on Sunday, August 30, 2015Some inmates have nicknamed the new diet the  Chinese menu,  due to rice being the only thing officially served in prison. Eighty percent of prisons have banned relatives from bringing inmates food despite the crisis. Those outside of prison also suffer through great food shortages, however, as the nation imposed a ration system in supermarkets that has made it nearly impossible to legally purchase such necessary home goods as milk, vegetable oil, and flour. As a result, a black market on the Venezuelan-Colombian border has flourished, where Venezuelans trade their cheap oil for basic foods easily purchased in Colombia.Such human rights violations raise particular questions in Venezuela, where being publicly opposed to the socialist regime of President Nicol s Maduro could easily land anyone in prison. At its peak, the regime was arresting one anti-socialist protester every half hour in 2014. Prisons in the country are overflowing with prisoners of conscience, not just standard criminals.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Sep 2, 2015"
 New Report Says Trump Destroyed Scaramucci’s Marriage,"Donald Trump s new pick for Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, is apparently so enamored with Trump that it s come between him and his wife, at least according to the New York Post s Page Six.Scaramucci s wife, Deidre Ball, was a Vice President in investor relations for Scaramucci s former company, SkyBridge Capital. According to Page Six, Ball is filing for divorce because of Scaramucci s ambition and his desire to get close to Trump, who she can t stand. They have been married for three years and have two children together.One source told Page Six,  Deidre has left him and has filed for divorce. She liked the nice Wall Street life and their home on Long Island, not the insane world of D.C. She is tired of his naked ambition, which is so enormous that it left her at her wits  end. She has left him even though they have two children together. A second source close to Scaramucci   who has alternately not been wearing his wedding ring, or has been sporting it on his right hand   said the former couple had fought over his loyalty to Trump. This was his second marriage and Ball was noticeably not present at his recent SALT conference in mid-May.The New York Post is traditionally one of the few media outlets that refuses to report on everything negative about the Trump administration and ,maybe the reason this story made the papers is that it s all about Scaramucci s swooning love affair with Trump. The Mooch,  as Scaramucci refers to himself, admires Trump s alleged athletic abilities: I ve seen this guy throw a dead spiral through a tire. I ve seen him at Madison Square Garden with a topcoat on. He s standing in the key and he s hitting foul shots and swishing them, OK? He sinks 3-foot putts. Source: NewsweekIn fact, during his initial press briefing, the Mooch used the word  love  21 times, and most of them were about Trump. I love the President, and I m very, very loyal to the President. And I love the mission that the President has, okay? Since the early days of the campaign when I went to these rallies and I saw the love that the people had for the President, and I grew up in the middle class, and so there s a struggle out there. The President saw that before I did. I wish I could tell you I saw it before him, but he taught it to me. And I feel that struggle and have empathy for that struggle, and I want to be here to help him make things better for the American people.What do you want to bet that his wife doesn t receive the same sort of adulation. Brava to Ball, though, for standing up for her principles and for her perfectly normal hatred of Donald Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"July 28, 2017"
 WATCH: The Media Gives MI’s Gov. Rick Snyder The Tongue Lashing He Deserves (VIDEOS),"Michigan s governor Rick Snyder is desperately trying to retain some credibility by increasing his presence in the media. It isn t working. All he is doing is proving to the world that he is as much a scumbag as the world thinks he is.In an interview with Fox 2, Snyder said that he would let his grandchildren be bathed in Flint, Michigan. During the interview, Charlie LeDuff asks Rick Snyder: Would you have your grandchildren bathe daily in that water coming out of those pipes, now? Yeah, because again, that s the advice I ve gotten,  Snyder says. I wouldn t let my child chew on a Chinese made toy, I don t think I d let my child, as just as person, a rational person that doesn t know that much, bathe in water what we know there s high levels of lead,  LeDuff responds.  You would let your grandchild bathe in that? Snyder then tries to squirm his way out of the gaffe he just made by giving this poor explanation for his claim: We don t know that there s necessarily high levels of lead in every bath tub. But again, there could be this risk. But we ve been told by the experts  by itself You just don t leave them by themselves. you need to monitor that to make sure they don t drink the water. Here s the interview.It really sounded like Snyder was trying to make the contamination of Flint s water sound safer than it is, didn t it? That s really weird because just hours earlier, Snyder went on CBS for an interview where he said that they don t want people to assume that the water in Flint is safer than it is.During that interview, Snyder was again, completely hammered for his utter incompetence. Snyder failed to answer even basic questions about what people desperately want to know.The interviewer, Scott Pelley, asks Snyder: Governor, is the water in Flint safe today? Snyder responds, saying: We don t want to consider it safe, Scott. I think we ve seen progress in terms of improvements in the water testing. But until it s been thoroughly tested, including third-party verification, we want people to assume that they should be using filters, or bottled water as an interim measure. Pelley presses Snyder: So fair to say you don t know what the lead content is in the water? Snyder responds, saying: Well, again   we don t want people to believe it s safe. Extensive testing is going on, has been going on for some time. At that point, Pelley seems to have had enough of Snyder s evasiveness. He grills Snyder, saying: I don t understand why you can t give us the latest testing data and what it shows for the water in Flint. What is the number? Snyder, still trying to down play his incompetence, says: I don t have the number at the top of my head of the very latest data. And it varies by parts of the city. To this, Pelley eviscerates Snyder, saying: I would think that the governor of Michigan would have those numbers at the top of his mind right now.

 Fox News Host BEGS Republicans: Leave Trump ALOOOONE (VIDEO),"Fox News host Eric Bolling wants mean Republicans to just leave his favorite candidate, Donald Trump, alone. Bolling, the host of the Fox weekend business news show Cashin  In, released a special message on the Saturday edition of the program timed to coincide with the upcoming South Carolina primary.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8QbU8YMdMBolling, who also co-hosts The Five during the week, noted that the  Our Principles  Republican super PAC headed by former Romney aide Katie Packer is targeting Trump. The ads show that on a number of issues, Trump has flip-flopped from a moderate/liberal position to positions designed to pander to conservative Republican voters. Abortion, health care, and taxes are among Trump s flip-flops.While you would think Bolling, a conservative, would be happy to see an expose of Trump s fakery, his problem is actually with the ad itself.In his rant, Bolling complains about establishment Republicans consistently tearing down conservatives, as he sees it, and points out that he believes the PAC ad is a part of this sustained campaign.He calls on the ad makers to stop going after the reality star turned Republican presidential front-runner and racial demagogue. Bolling, speaking to the camera, told the PAC that  Trump s not your problem. Liberals and socialists are.  He suggests that instead  Why not use that Super PAC money to expose the dark underbelly of liberal politics? Bolling s suggestion is humorous because he effectively works for the biggest anti-liberal Super PAC around, Fox News. His network is a steady stream of lies, half-truths, and propaganda designed to attack the Democratic Party and the left. At the same time, actual super PACs on the right and other dark money groups designed to shield their donors are consistently the source of propaganda campaigns against the left. The Koch Brothers preside over a network that some believe could spend $1 billion in 2016 in order to elect a Republican president and congress.Fox has been the premiere media vehicle for Trump. He has received more airtime on the network than any other candidate, and even when feuding with Fox host Megyn Kelly, he still got coverage on their prime time programming. Of those at Fox, Bolling has been one of the staunchest supporters and defenders of Trump s campaign for months now, and according to a report he was directly ordered to back Trump by Fox News boss Roger Ailes.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 13, 2016"

Russia-Gate Was All the Rage Across US Media – Where Did it Go and Why?,"21st Century Wire says Russia-gate was pushed by US media outlets everywhere   only to disappear after the highly questionable chemical attack in the Idlib province of Syria. The fact is, the media drums over the Trump-Russia story soon fell silent after a US military strike was ordered on the Syrian government s Shayrat Air Base and a Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) was dropped on Afghanistan.The US media had been floating the  blame Russia  meme for months, and even more conveniently during this past 2016 US presidential election cycle, before morphing into the dodgy dossier that included unverified Trump-Russia claims. Now after two neocon approved US military missile strikes in Syria and Afghanistan, the heavily propagandized and unproven Trump-Russian narrative vanished from headline news as soon as war theater increased in the Middle East.More on the story from Consortium News below Consortium News Exclusive: For five months, there was a daily drumbeat on Russia-gate, the sprawling conspiracy theory that Russia had somehow put Donald Trump in the White House, but suddenly the  scandal  disappeared, notes Robert Parry.By Robert ParryDemocrats, liberals and some progressives might be feeling a little perplexed over what has happened to Russia-gate, the story that pounded Donald Trump every day since his election last November   until April 4, that is.On April 4, Trump fully capitulated to the neoconservative bash-Russia narrative amid dubious claims about a chemical attack in Syria. On April 6, Trump fired off 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airbase; he also restored the neocon demand for  regime change  in Syria; and he alleged that Russia was possibly complicit in the supposed chemical attack.Since Trump took those actions   in accordance with the neocon desires for more  regime change  in the Middle East and a costly New Cold War with Russia   Russia-gate has almost vanished from the news.I did find a little story in the lower right-hand corner of page A12 of Saturday s New York Times about a still-eager Democratic congressman, Mike Quigley of Illinois, who spent a couple of days in Cyprus which attracted his interest because it is a known site for Russian money-laundering, but he seemed to leave more baffled than when he arrived. The more I learn, the more complex, layered and textured I see the Russia issue is   and that reinforces the need for professional full-time investigators,  Quigley said, suggesting that the investigation s failure to strike oil is not that the holes are dry but that he needs better drill bits.Yet, given all the hype and hullabaloo over Russia-gate, the folks who were led to believe that the vague and amorphous allegations were  bigger than Watergate  might now be feeling a little used. It appears they may have been sucked into a conspiracy frenzy in which the Establishment exploited their enthusiasm over the  scandal  in a clever maneuver to bludgeon an out-of-step new President back into line.If that s indeed the case, perhaps the most significant success of the Russia-gate ploy was the ouster of Trump s original National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen as a key proponent of a New D tente with Russia, and his replacement by General H.R. McMaster, a prot g  of neocon favorite, retired Gen.

 This Activist Might Go To Jail For Criticizing Michigan’s Governor On Facebook (IMAGE),"A Michigan man just received a disturbing letter. The letter alleges that he has violated his probation for  threatening  Michigan s Governor, Rick Snyder, on Facebook.In 2013, Chris Wahmhoff, of Kalamazoo, Michigan was arrested for protesting the rebuilding and expansion of a pipeline that ruptured in 2010, creating the largest inland oil spill in history. In December 2014, Wahmoff was sentenced to probation, in lieu of a jail sentence.Wahmhoff received a letter from his probation officer, claiming that he has violated the terms of his probation on three counts. The first count is for his failure to pay back restitution. The second is for failing to provide his DNA for testing. The third count is where things get quite disturbing.The letter says that he has violated his probation for allegedly threatening Rick Snyder. The letter reads:Count 3: On 1.27.16 the defendant displayed threatening behavior on social media (Facebook) when he responded to a posting pertaining to the Governor of Michigan hiring two public relations firms in lieu of hiring to restore the infrastructure to provide clean water for Flint when he stated  so when y all are ready to march in and take his ass across the street I have my torch, I got warm socks. I m waiting on y all. This is in no way a credible threat of violence. In fact, it is actually quite tame compared to many of the things that have been posted about Snyder. Cher caught wind of the situation going on in Flint, Michigan before the story had reached critical mass. She called for Snyder to be put in front of a firing squad.

That being said, the people of Michigan    well, people all over the U.S. and the world for that matter   have already found Snyder to be guilty. He has eroded democracy through his expansion of Michigan s emergency manager law. He has poisoned an entire city. At least ten people have already died from water contamination. When people refer to Snyder as a baby killer, it is by no means an exaggeration.I spoke to Wahmhoff over the phone. He says that he was publicly calling for a citizen s arrest of Rick Snyder. Wahmhoff is emphatic that he does not think that people should go into the Capital building  guns blazing.  He doesn t want any violence to come to Snyder. He does, however, think he needs to be removed from office immediately. Wahmhoff told Addicting Info: I never intended to call for violence against Rick Snyder.. But according to Michigan law 764.16 (b), I have the right to, and do intend to legally invoke the arrest of governor Rick Snyder for felonious child endangerment. Not just for Flint, but for Detroit, for the Kalamazoo River, and for the children who will continue to suffer as long as Rick Snyder is in power. The right-wing has usurped and bastardized the concept of government tyranny and the expulsion of tyrants, to the point where birthers think that President Obama should be removed from office by force. Those people are insane. I by no means support violence. Though I have to say, I am sure that the founders of the United States would consider the Snyder administration a domestic threat. As many have pointed out, the poisoning of an entire city s water supply is an act that any ISIS member would look upon with envy.There are mobs of people out there who actually would tear Rick Snyder to shreds, given the opportunity. In light of that, the idea that someone would actually take a person s vague comment from Facebook seriously enough to consider it a violation of their probation, is absurd. Especially when the person who made the comment is on probation for protesting a corporation that created the worst environmental disaster in Michigan s history   not including the current crisis in Flint, of course. Michigan activists are planning a protest, to stand in solidarity with Wahmhoff. Featured Image Credit: Donkey Hotey via Flickr. With letter screenshot added by Joe Fletcher.

 Jim Vejvoda’s HILARIOUS Scalia Tweet Is Nothing Short Of PERFECT (IMAGE),"Republicans love to say that they are the party of God. More than a few GOP presidential candidates in the last year have said that God values their bigoted, conservative  family values  and assorted despicable  principles  and points of view, but the death of Antonin Scalia really calls all of that into question. Scalia was about as much of a far-right nut as anyone could ask for, and now that he is dead, the right is terrified that President Obama will nominate someone with a bit of sense, compassion, and knowledge of the Constitution to the Court to replace him.However, the fact that Scalia died when he did completely undermines the idea that some kind of higher power favors far right nonsense, and movie executive extraordinaire Jim Vejoda brillianatly pointed that out on Twitter. Vejoda pointed out that the stars could not have aligned more perfectly for liberals with the timing of Scalia s death:He s right, of course. If conservatives are claiming that some divine power is on their side after this one, they really are delusional. Get it through your heads, right-wingers: Nobody, including the universe, likes ugly, and you folks are as ugly as they come. Most folks are saying good riddance to Antonin Scalia   apparently, including your so-called God.Featured image from Twitter",News,"February 15, 2016"
IF OBAMA HAD A DAUGHTER: [VIDEO] #BlackLivesMatter Terrorist Arrested For Vile Threats Against Whites And Cops On YouTube,"Even though this #BlackLivesMatter terrorist clearly calls for the killing of Whites and cops in her YouTube videos, Latausha Nedd  denies it. No word yet from her mother yet on how she wouldn t harm anyone and doesn t have a racist bone in her body https://youtu.be/d3yWQLVqiOoA  BlackLivesMatter  activist in Clayton County, GA, was (finally) arrested after making threats against police officers on her YouTube channel.Latausha Nedd   who calls herself Eye Empress Sekhmet   was arrested for making threats against police officers and taken into custody. In the video of her arrest, she claims since her threats were on a YouTube channel, they were somehow innocuous. But Nedd has built up a pretty good resume of violent, racist and criminal calls to bloodshed.Here s the video where Nedd declares  open season  on the  motherf*cking crackers,  points a gun at the camera and shows images of white police officers.https://youtu.be/VMhrAmZPjJkWSB-TV is reporting Nedd denied advocating killing cops, even though that s precisely what she did. This is about a YouTube video? I ve seen worse on YouTube,  Nedd said from the back of a police cruiser.  All I said was defend yourself against people who want to kill us. That s all. I never said anything more than that. Nedd claims she s harmless. But according to police, her words are as dangerous as any weapon.Here she is protesting Stone Mountain with more racist, anti-American #BlackLivesMatter idiots: It s also the reaction she solicits or anyone solicits from people who may be listening,  Register said.Nedd remains in the Clayton County Jail, charged with making terroristic threats and transmitting those threats through social media.Nedd has been involved with the  BlackLivesMatter  movement for some time.

" Sorry, Trump! Hillary Says ‘A Lot’ Of Republicans Are Practically BEGGING To Help Her Win (VIDEO)","Throughout Donald Trump s entire campaign cycle, many conservatives have spoken out against the business mogul/reality television star and expressed their opposition to his candidacy. However, now that his competition is out of the race and Trump is the Republican party s presumptive nominee, right-wingers are desperately seeking a way to make sure Trump doesn t further ruin America. For many of them, this means supporting Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton by any means possible.On CBS  Face The Nation, Clinton revealed that over the past few days   basically ever since it became clear that Trump will likely be representing the GOP in the general election   she s been getting  a lot  of Republicans asking to help her campaign. Many of these conservatives are passionate #NeverTrump voters who would rather abandon their party and vote blue in the election than vote one of the most terrible people in the United States into the White House.During the interview, John Dickerson asked Clinton how she plans to handle conservatives who are still  skeptical,  but embracing the idea of voting for her.Clinton simply replied that she is not only more than qualified to be the next President, but has a  track record of getting results.  The former Secretary of State said: I am asking people to join this campaign and I ve had a lot of outreach from Republicans in the last days who say they are interested in talking about that. You can watch the interview below:The speed at which Trump has pulled the Republican party apart is impressive to say the least. We could have predicted that some conservatives would be jumping ship by the party s reaction when Trump was first announced as the party s presumptive nominee. The sheer rage from conservatives was priceless   many of them not only burned, tore up or destroyed their voter registrations cards by other measures, but many changed their party entirely. So while Trump has risen amongst his own supporters for being more vulgar and offensive than ever, he is only helping to unify the rest of the country   against him.Featured image via Justin Sullivan / Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2016"
N.C. EVENT TO CHANGE ITS NAME BECAUSE THE WORD ‘DIXIE’ IS RACIST AND ‘OFFENSIVE’?,"This is political correctness run amuck with the effort of a City Councilman to change the name of a fair that s been in existence since the 50 s! The Dixie Classic Fair is suddenly an offensive name just like the Confederate flag was all of a sudden offensive. What about Dixie Crystals Sugar or Dixie Cups? Is it that any word that brings a negative emotion out in someone is banned for fear they may be offended?  If everyone tried to ban a word that offended them then we d have no more words left or is it just the black community that can be offended by a word? Which is it?I LOVE THIS BILLBOARD FROM THE FAIR:WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.   Every year, thousands of people flock to the Dixie Classic Fair. Whether it is the rides, the food or the history, it continues to be an annual favorite.However, Winston-Salem Councilman James Taylor told FOX8 that some of the people he represents find the  Dixie Classic Fair  name to be  offensive. Taylor said that some people are  angry  with the name and believes the city should consider changing it. He added that   as a city that is progressive   and is continuing to move forward, they need a name that  everyone can appreciate. He says his goal is to find a name that doesn t divide the people, but instead one that unites them.Taylor wanted to stress that he wants  to talk to the people first,  and if they don t want to change it they won t change it, saying that he  will do what s best for all the people. So, we went out to the people ourselves to see how they feel. It s just a political thing. I don t think they named it that because of anything to do with race,  said Michael Banner, a Winston-Salem resident who said he frequents the fair.  Leave it alone. It [isn t] bothering me going over there, so I m all right with it. It doesn t make me any different because I m going whether they change the name or not,  said Marion Speis, also of Winston-Salem.  Different things for different strokes, [nobody is going to] go along with everything.   Some said that the idea of removing Confederate symbols has gone too far and made its way to the name of the fair. OK, take the flag, that s OK; put it in a museum or something,  said Marjorie Claycomb, of Winston-Salem.  But they re making too much of it. I just think it s just overkill from what s going on right now,  said Scott Osborne, who said he regularly attends the fair.  Dixie doesn t have anything to do with being offensive towards what anyone s belief is. We continued to look for people who may be offended by the name   but regardless of their gender, age or race   nobody had anything negative to say about the fair or its name. It s just a name. I don t find it offensive,  said Kevin Carter, who routinely brings his family to the fair.  If they didn t let certain people go in, but, everybody goes. I thought it was ridiculous. I mean, there s no reason to change the name of the Dixie Classic Fair,  said Dina Nelson, of Winston-Salem.  I mean, it s a Southern name, but there is nothing racist about it. I don t see anything wrong with that name. Not at all. Not one bit,  said Reginald Cunningham, of Winston-Salem.  It s not one of my main problems that I see needs to be solved right now. The Dixie Classic Fair name has been in existence since the 1950s. Last year, the city changed the name of the venue to the Winston-Salem Fairgrounds. Via: myfox8",politics,"Aug 14, 2015"
CRAZY VIDEO OF MUSLIM JIHADESS Being Dragged Up Hill In Burqa After Police Arrest Her For Plot To Blow Up Train,"Feel good video of the day A female ISIS recruiter who planned to blow up a French train station was engaged to a jihadist who beheaded a Catholic priest and the terrorist who murdered a police couple.French police believe one of the gang, known only as Sarah H., 23, was due to marry Larossi Aballa, 25.Aballa murdered a police man and his officer wife outside Paris in June before he was himself shot dead.Molins said the woman was engaged to Larossi Abballa, who killed two police officials in Magnanville in June and filmed the aftermath on Facebook Live before dying in a police raid.He said she was also betrothed to Adel Kermiche, who slit the throat of an elderly French priest during morning Mass in July. Her current fiance was arrested on Thursday, Molins said. He added:  In the last few days and hours a terrorist cell was dismantled, composed of young women totally receptive to the deadly Daesh ideology. Today it emerged that the female jihadi cell   the first of its kind in France   had wanted to attack the Gare du Lyon in Paris, which is one of the busiest rail stations in Europe. Police and officers from the DGSI, France s counter terrorism intelligence agency, had been on the trail of the trio since Sunday, when a car full of gas cannisters was found parked in Paris. In a briefing after the raid, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said:  These three young, radicalised women were preparing an imminent and violent attack. Three women were arrested in Bossy-Saint-Antoine, in the Essonne following the finding, and an officer was stabbed by a suspect who was then shot in the head.

TRUMP GETS HAMMERED [Video] For Not Condemning Question At Town Hall About Muslim Training Camps In US…But He Was Right…And Here’s The Proof,"Yeah, because taking Trump down is more important to these flame throwers on the left (and right) than exposing the truth about Obama s  overt allegiance to Muslims living in America and the actual Muslim training camps that are taking place across America right now.Donald Trump pulled out of a Republican gathering in South Carolina Friday as he took hits from members of both parties for failing to correct a questioner who said President Obama is a Muslim. Mr. Trump has a significant business transaction that was expected to close Thursday. Due to the delay he is unable to attend today s Heritage Action Presidential Forum,  Trump s campaign announced in a release Friday.Trump had been scheduled to join most of the Republican field at the meeting of the influential conservative group.Trump drew condemnation Friday from some of his rivals for his failure to confront the questioner at a New Hampshire town hall who had labeled the president a Muslim, asked what he would do to  get rid  of Muslims and mentioned Islamic  training camps. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told NBC Friday,  I wouldn t have permitted that. If someone brought that up at a town hall meeting of mine, I would ve said,  No, listen. Before we answer, let s clear some things up for the rest of the audience. And I think you have an obligation as a leader to do that. If that person had been in my event I would have called him out in it,  Hillary Clinton said at a press conference after a campaign event in New Hampshire. Not only is it out of place and wrong it is totally factually untrue.  Sen. Bernie Sanders demanded that Trump apologize for  continuing the lie that the president is not an American and not a Christian. FOX News   Hidden in a remote area off a primitive dirt road lies a mysterious 70-acre compound in which more than 100 Muslims live in seclusion, following the teachings of its founder, a radical cleric with alleged ties to terrorism.It s neither a Taliban stronghold outside Jalalabad, nor an extremist madrassa on the outskirts of Karachi.It s a place called Islamberg, a closed and seemingly quiet community at the foot of the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, about three hours north of Manhattan.It s also a compound shrouded in local rumors, mystery   and fear   sitting near the huge reservoir system that provides New York City with most of its drinking water.Quietly nestled in the woods, Islamberg remained unnoticed for the two decades leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked by a determined band of Islamic extremists.That s when people started questioning the community s ties to a Pakistani cleric allegedly connected to worldwide terrorism. They also started talking about the unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions some said they heard emanating from the compound.But before you leap to conclusions and head to the Catskills to personally fight the war on terror   you need to know the entire story. The truth, as is often the case, is a lot more complicated than the headlines suggest.Islamberg got its start about 20 years ago, when   inspired by the words of the Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani   a group of primarily black Muslims from Brooklyn left New York City to escape crime, poverty and racism. Aiming to lead what they believed was a peaceful and holy Muslim life, they built a community of some 40 family houses, their own grocery store and a bookstore.And they weren t alone. Other groups, also inspired by Gilani, have set up similiar communities in 19 other states. According to the group s own Web site, the Islamberg community is still  struggling,  and is asking for donations to complete its mosque.According to locals, the land previously belonged to a Deposit, N.Y., woman who opened up her home in the in the late 1970s or early  80s to disadvantaged youths from the city so that they could avoid being led astray by a financially and morally bankrupt urban environment.Those boys, according to locals who were friendly with some of the group, eventually went on to form Islamberg, and at some point they were joined by another group of more militant Muslims, who created something of a rival faction within the community.The group lived quietly there for years with little interaction with the local communities except for forays into town for supplies or to sell baked goods at the weekly flea market. Some of the men had jobs at a local credit-processing center or working for the Port Authority in New York City (where they are said to maintain a residence near a bridge that runs between two boroughs).In the few instances when they did have relationships with the locals, they were almost always friendly, many said. Sometimes local children would visit their friends in the compound. There was a sense of camaraderie with them,  one woman said.Watch video here:There was a notable exception, a situation involving the local schools in the late 1990s when some of the Islamberg boys got into a scuffle with local boys. They broke my nephew s nose,  said a Hancock, N.Y., woman, who asked that her name not be used.Another man said the Muslim boys  trashed  the school in Deposit.Locals variously blamed the fighting on an angry attitude on the part of the Muslim boys, racism on the part of the local boys or the  usual  relatively trivial events that lead almost all teenage boys into a confrontation at one point or another in their lives.According to Joy Felber, 62, a retired taxidermist who s lived in Deposit for 19 years, the cause lay with a group of local boys who picked a fight with the Muslims. We had some young boys in town who were causing trouble   not from the Muslim community   but they were antagonizing the boys in the Muslim community,  Felber said.  It was lack of knowledge. When people don t know other people, they have a tendency to lash out. And you put two teenage boys together and sparks fly. After a further controversy about whether the Islamberg boys should have been going to public school in Deposit or Hancock (the compound lies on the border between the two towns, and even longtime residents differ on whether it s technically in Deposit, Hancock or nearby Tompkins), the boys were pulled from the schools and the Muslim community drew away from town life.All Islamberg children are now schooled on the compound in a school that, according to one report, has a total of 62 students.",left-news,"Sep 18, 2015"
OOPS! NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS WOMAN Who Accused Roy Moore of Sexual Misconduct Worked For Hillary Campaign…Supported His Democrat Opponent On Facebook,"Infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the Facebook page of one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers, Debbie Gibson, who came out in a Washington Post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place 36 years ago.Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said  Roy Moore,  her mother said,  I d say you were the luckiest girl in the world. Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore  had this godlike, almost deity status   he was a hometown boy made good,  Gibson says,  West Point and so forth. Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. Looking back, I m glad nothing bad happened,  says Gibson, who now lives in Florida.  As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate. Debbie Gibson hates Donald Trump, but that s not all, she s pretty fond of Judge Roy Moore s opponent, Doug Ross for US Senate In Alabama as well Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson s Facebook page: One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we re not sure who she s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked  diverse  crowd, appears to be pretty thin.Here s a post from Gibson s page proving that she s supporting Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent for US Senate:She even posted a video of Moore s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook. The screenshot below shows the post on her page. Interestingly, when attacking Moore ally Steve Bannon for suggesting the Washington Post was politically motivated in its reporting, the newspaper implied that Gibson wasn t  down with Democratic propaganda,  a statement which seemingly conflicts with Gibson s political activism:That s not what the photos say The Washington Post reported: According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary But notice the precise wording; it s lawyer-speak. It might very well be true that Gibson didn t donate or work for Doug Jones, but according to her Facebook profile, she did actively campaign for him, which doesn t help her credibility and it should have been reported   yet the Washington Post conveniently left it out.",left-news,"Nov 10, 2017"
THE TRUTH About APPLE vs The US Government…And Why Americans Should Care Who Wins," Americans need to know the truth about Apple and what the government is asking them to do. They need to know what Apple has already agreed to do for the incompetent government. This article spells it all out Before we get into too much detail about the Apple VS US Government dispute, we thought it was important to share with you a letter from Apple CEO Tim Cook to their customers:February 16, 2016 The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.This moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.Smartphones, led by iPhone, have become an essential part of our lives. People use them to store an incredible amount of personal information, from our private conversations to our photos, our music, our notes, our calendars and contacts, our financial information and health data, even where we have been and where we are going.All that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.For many years, we have used encryption to protect our customers  personal data because we believe it s the only way to keep their information safe. We have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business.We were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino last December. We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government s efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists.When the FBI has requested data that s in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and we ve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal.We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software   which does not exist today   would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone s physical possession.The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.Some would argue that building a backdoor for just one iPhone is a simple, clean-cut solution. But it ignores both the basics of digital security and the significance of what the government is demanding in this case.In today s digital world, the  key  to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge.The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks   from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers   including tens of millions of American citizens   from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority.The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by  brute force,  trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.The implications of the government s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone s device to capture their data. The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone s microphone or camera without your knowledge.Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.We are challenging the FBI s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.While we believe the FBI s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.Tim Cook, Apple CEORush Limbaugh explains how our incompetent government is responsible for the mess in which they find themselves: The terrorists  phones were not owned by the terrorist. Mr. Syed Farook Skyhook did not own his phone. San Bernardino County owned the phone.Do you know that over the weekend we learned the FBI told San Bernardino to change the password on this phone? They thought that they would be able to find out information if they changed the  Well, not the password. The Apple ID password. It s just it s an absolute mess. Nobody knows what s going on or how to use these things.Since San Bernardino County owned the phone, they could have had total control over it. If you are a business right now and you deploy iPhones   and I m gonna stick with iPhones in this case  cause that s what I know, but it s true of any others. If you re a small business, a corporation, and you provide phones for your employees and you own those phones, there is something called Digital Device Management. It is software that allows you to control everything on their phone.You can put restrictions on what they can do with it. You can put restrictions on which apps work and which apps won t. In other words, you can stop them from using the phone personally. In addition to that, you, because you own the phone, have the ability to erase it at any time and find out what s on it. You can reset the pass code yourself as the owner of the phone. You can do it with four clicks.If the people in San Bernardino County had ever taken the time to find out what they could do with the phones that they were giving to employees, if they had just taken the time to have somebody come in and teach them, we wouldn t be here. Because there already is a way for the FBI and San Bernardino to get what they want in the circumstance where somebody s using a phone owned by a business: It s called MDM. Mobile Device Management. And in the case of Apple, it s free. Other software, $4 a phone is what it averages out but with OS X server which is simply what you would need. It s an app, a server operating system. You can deploy  All you have to do is set up the profiles for the phones that you want that are under your management. This is why you have an IT guy. It s why you hire one. And there is a specific opportunity for owners of phones in this   like San Bernardino County, they could have gone in.It costs about $4 per phone and you have your IT manager research it and learn how to operate it, and you control and manage every phone that you deploy, remotely. You don t have to have it in your possession to set up these restrictions. It just has to be signed in to the proper ID, Apple ID, and whatever other identification systems a company uses.The moment this incident happened, they could have locked Farook and whoever out of the phone, anybody else, and only allowed themselves in. They could have gone in, they could have gotten every bit of data they wanted off that phone via a backup or a dump. They could have changed the password themselves. They could have done any number of these things. But they didn t know they could. They had no idea. And I ll wager that 95% of companies or organizations that give away phones or provide them for businesses have no clue about any of this.Apple doesn t need to add anything, and the FBI doesn t need to have Apple rewrite software for all of us because what they want exists in a large number of circumstances and did exist in this San Bernardino situation. But I m sure the people at San Bernardino were clueless and had no idea how to do this. They even confused the passcode to unlock phone and the passport for the Apple ID connecting the phone to iCloud. They got confused over that. They literally had no idea what they were doing. It s stunning what they did not know. ",Government News,"Feb 22, 2016"

WHOA! CLINTON GRIFTERS BAGGED $100 Million From “Blood Minerals” Firm,"The Clinton grifters have been at this scam for so long that it s hard to keep up with all the money. In 2007, they bagged a HUGE donation for $100 million from a firm with a very shady reputation:When the Vancouver, Canada-based Lundin Group gave its $100 million commitment to the  Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative,  the company had long been cutting deals with warlords, Marxist rebels, military strongmen and dictatorships in the war-torn African countries of Congo, Sudan and Ethiopia.A little known Swedish-Canadian oil and mining conglomerate human rights groups have repeatedly charged produces  blood minerals  is among the Clinton Foundation s biggest donors, thanks to a $100 million pledge in 2007, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation has found. Blood minerals  are related to  blood diamonds,  which are allegedly mined in war zones or sold as commodities to help finance political insurgencies or despotic warlords.When the Vancouver, Canada-based Lundin Group gave its $100 million commitment to the  Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative,  the company had long been cutting deals with warlords, Marxist rebels, military strongmen and dictatorships in the war-torn African countries of Congo, Sudan and Ethiopia.Lundin promoted its reputation as a fierce, hard-driving company. Adolf Lundin, who founded the company, audaciously traveled to the French home of Congo dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1996 to secure mining rights for his company. A few years later, Lundin admitted he had offered a  donation  to Mobutu s  elections campaign,  but later said he never gave the funds.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"May 25, 2016"
WOW! WHY TRUMP’S PICK FOR LABOR SECRETARY Withdrew Just Hours Before His Senate Hearing,"President Donald Trump s pick for secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, has withdrawn from the nomination just hours before his first scheduled appearance before the Senate HELP committee.Puzder s nomination was controversial from the start because of some of his own business practices that many felt were less than generous.  He officially withdrew after an interview his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, did on The Oprah Winfrey Show came to light.  She claimed that she had to flee from her, then husband, and that she had been abused by Puzder during their marriage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cURHgCbSWOcFierstein has since admitted that her allegations were false and that she concocted them to get a better settlement in their divorce.  She has also sent a letter to the Senate in an attempt to clear her ex-husband s name but it seems to be too little too late.Puzder released this statement concerning his withdrawal.I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor. I'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me.  Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) February 15, 2017(Source: Daily Mail) ",Government News,"Feb 15, 2017"

 Trump Cancels Trip To Israeli Historic Site After Authorities Say He Can’t Land His Helicopter On It,"In yet another example of Trump s inability to maintain even a slight bit of tact while representing America s interests overseas, the White House reportedly canceled plans to visit a historic landmark during his visit to Israel   one of the nation s biggest tourist attractions. The reason: Trump wanted to land his helicopter directly on the ancient mountain fortress and was told no.President Donald Trump has canceled a planned visit and speech at the ancient mountain fortress of Masada in Israel after authorities told him that he could not land his helicopter on top of the UNESCO-listed site.Instead, Trump will now deliver a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. It comes after an Israeli Air Force (IAF) regulation that prevents helicopters landing at the summit of the Masada site, according to Israel s Channel 2 broadcaster.Unlike former presidents who have made the trip, such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Trump declined to land the helicopter at a base of the historic site and then take the cable car up, preferring to cancel the visit altogether.The reasons not allowing helicopters near the 2,000-year-old ruins should be obvious: For starters, the dust and sand that characterize the mountaintop are extremely rough on helicopter motors. Secondly, the wind and sand kicked up by the powerful blades can destroy the ancient structures, costing archaeologists priceless artifacts. Avoiding those issues by simply getting in a cable car was apparently too much energy.It may be another sign that Trump is hoping to breeze past this trip while doing minimal work. Sources close to Trump say he is extremely upset about having to travel abroad for a multi-day trip to the Middle East and already begged his staff to cut the number of days he d be gone. Keen observers of Trump s habits might note that Trump will be missing at least two weekends during the trip, days he typically reserves for golfing at his various private courses.Trump s demands on his overseas guests have raised eyebrows before. Earlier this year, Trump created a stir in England when reports leaked that he had requested Queen Elizabeth pick him up in a golden chariot:The White House has made clear it regards the carriage procession down the Mall as an essential element of the itinerary for the visit currently planned for the second week of October, according to officials.The request frustrated royal planners who described the situation as a logistical and financial nightmare.It s unclear how Israelis will react to Trump s show of laziness during his trip. Already the country s mood toward Trump is souring after the president is said to have leaked classified information provided by Israeli intelligence services to the Russians. He hasn t even left the White House and already his trip is shaping up to be trouble.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2017"
How Trump is Accelerating the Decline of US Global Influence,"It should also be said that the current US Administration is merely finishing the job which started under three consecutive two-term presidents; Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama   something to bear in mind as Trump ends his first year in office.This new year, let us not forget who re-ignited the Middle East crisis, with the consecutive sackings of Libya and Syria The ""Moderate Rebel"" terrorists in Syria certainly miss you Barack, you were so generous to all of them.  Patrick Henningsen (@21WIRE) December 29, 2017While  Make America Great Again  might be the political campaign de jour at home, these next four years are likely to coincide with an overall decline in US influence in the world.Mehr News reports During the past decades after World WarII and disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the world has been dominated by the US in terms of politics, military and economy. But the rising of new world powers at the end of the 20th century and beginning of 21st century has challenged the US global domination. Washington s challenges with the new multipolar world order in recent years has resulted in the decline of US influence in the world, which is expected to be accelerated  withTrump s term in White House.Recognizing Al-Quds (Jerusalem) as Israeli regime s capital by Trump created lots of negative reaction and resulted in a resolution by the UN General Assembly despite the US threats   is a clear example of declining US global influence.Decline of US domination over world trade and financial regimesAfter the end of World WarII until 1960, the US held 40 percent of the world economy but after the rise of new economic powers like China, Japan and EU, in 2013 the US just held 25 percent of the world economy. Considering the recent decisions made by Trump to withdraw from TPP and NAFTA and tensions with EU, more decline is expected in near future.The Dollar dominated global financial, trade and banking regimes until the beginning of 21th century. The first blow to the dollar global stand was inflicted in 1999 when euro appeared as official currency of the EU. In recent years rise of Chinese renminbi has inflicted more blows to the dollar global stand, so that in 2015 only 50 to 60 percent of  world trades and transactions were done in dollar, according to EU central bank.During the past years, US sanctions against some countries like Russia, Iran and White House pressure on other countries to avoid transaction with these sanctioned countries, has resulted in some agreements between states to do their business in their own national currencies instead of dollar like the agreements between Iran, Russia, Turkey and China. Continuation of such agreements and trend will definitely lead to further decline of dollar global stand in future.Decline of the US strategic importance in terms of politics and militaryTrump s serious pressure on NATO   the most important strategic achievement of the US till now   with member states to pay more for the costs of the alliance, has inflicted serious damages to the solidarity of the member states and has created many doubts   so that some US old European allies are seriously after formation of a European Army.US inability to solve South Korea s missile and nuclear program issues despite Trump s rhetoric and bluffs, US inability to materialize its regional policy and plans in the Middle East to change the map of the region to the benefit of its own strategic interest and Israel s due to close cooperation of Iran, Russia, Turkey, Iraq and Syria   all these US failures and its wrong policies which have even forced some of its old regional allies like Turkey to recalibrate its relation and cooperation with White House in the region   shows the US limitations and incapability resulting in increasing decline of Washington s influence.Also the US inability to settle the issues in east of Ukraine and Crimea as its European allies expected has been a serious blow to its strategic stand among the Washington s European allies, and even worse nowadays as some of the Europeans consider US measures in east Europe as a blackmailing to gain the energy market of the EuropeDuring the last one year in office, Trump s moves to withdraw from Paris Climate Change accord, TPP, his wrong approach toward the nuclear deal with Iran (JCPOA), his insatiable immigration policy which has resulted in significant reduction in the number of foreign students in US for the first time, and finally his partial recognition of Al-Quds as Israeli regime s capital   all have inflicted serious blows to global credibility and influence of the country which cannot be at least mended in short-term.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"December 29, 2017"

 Mississippi Baker Who Made Cake For Republican Governor Publicly Humiliates Him,"Mississippi Republicans should worry about the billions of federal dollars they are about to lose but they should also worry about the Christian bakers they have pissed off.Just a few days ago, bakery owner Mitchell Moore blasted Republicans in his state for passing an anti-LGBT law that allows bigoted Christians to discriminate against employees and customers at will for any reason as long as they hide behind a so-called  sincerely held religious belief  to do so. The assumption that they think that they re looking out for us   that s not what they are doing,  Moore said during an interview about the new law, known as HB 1523.  We rank number one   our state government is the most dependent on federal money. We are the third most obese state. We rank at the bottom in unemployment, in education. We ve got crumbling infrastructure. None of them are being tackled. Instead, we are passing, hey-let s-discriminate bills. And now, a baker who made a cake for Governor Phil Bryant s inauguration is humiliating him and his Republican allies for making it difficult to be proud of Mississippi. Look Governor Bryant, we will make cakes for anyone!  Biloxi Cake Artist Extraordinaire Jennifer Noble wrote on Facebook underneath an image of her posing with Bryant.  Including backwards thinking politicians that make it hard to be proud of being a Mississippian. We never wanted this. Quit using our industry as an excuse to deny the separation of church and state. She then announced that she had removed the picture she took with Bryant and said she regrets posing for the photo now and is embarrassed she ever posted the picture on her page.Here s the full post via Facebook:So far, Noble s Facebook post has drawn nothing but positive responses and applause while Governor Bryant is still getting hammered for signing the discriminatory bill into law.And rightfully so. Bryant and his fellow Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for passing such a law and they should work to repeal it as soon as possible before Mississippi businesses decide that denying services to Republican lawmakers is their own  sincerely held religious belief.

 This One Car Could Overthrow The Governments Of America’s Enemies Better Than Any War Could (VIDEO),"For more than a century, countries around the world who found themselves rich in crude oil have held industrialized nations dependent on it hostage. Since the first Ford factory pushed out a production automobile, forever changing the way we travel, those countries with the means to fuel the internal combustion engine have prospered.The United States has prided itself on being peacemakers since World War II, but all too often we are held captive by what would otherwise be third world nations, often ruled by religious zealots and ruthless dictators. The first Gulf War was the perfect example. Kuwait, a long-standing ally and major supplier of oil to the U.S., was toppled within days by Saddam Hussein, who wanted control of their port and their oil. The United States had no choice but to step in, calling it a humanitarian mission and sending Hussein back to Baghdad, but stopping short of toppling his regime once the oil was secured. Suddenly, it became far more important to put out oil field fires than it was to remove a ruthless murderer from power.Our government and our allies have to protect the interests of their people. In doing so we are stuck dealing with people like the Saudis, who have a Royal Family with good intentions but are ultimately ruled by fundamentalist clerics at the local level. Human rights violations far exceed what we would consider acceptable if they weren t such a large supplier of oil to NATO countries. There are examples of the same kinds of abuses from all over the oil-rich world, but the black gold tends to keep anyone from being held accountable.So how could we make it possible to rid the world of tyranny and oppression bought and paid for with crude oil? By eliminating it from the equation. Elon Musk and Tesla have just announced that we are one giant leap closer to that goal with the rollout of the model 3 , a production model fully electric car that will be available by the end of 2107 for a starting price of $35,000. With the power to go from zero to 60 in six seconds and more than 200 miles on a single charge, the Tesla model 3 could realistically change the world.Once an idea becomes a reality, the next step is to make it affordable. While $35K may seem out of reach for many, it s certainly right in line with the $33,500 average selling price of a new car in America. From there the technology should migrate to other modes of transportation. The world is a changing place, and this major step in our socioeconomic evolution is a milestone we should all be ecstatic to see.https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/10154647071941509/ Featured image from Jordan Pix/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2016"
" In HISTORY MAKING Kiss Cam Moment, Gay Couple Featured At NHL Game (VIDEO)","During nearly every sporting event, at one point in the game, the cameras are taken off the game to scan the crowd for loving couples to smooch each other on the infamous  Kiss Cam.  Almost always, or let s just say it like it is, these cameras seem to always find straight couples. However, last year, a beautiful couple got caught on the Kiss Cam at Dodger stadium, and it looks as though another beautiful couple got their moment recently during a hockey game.In what is being reported as the first same-sex Kiss Cam moment in NHL history, Brad Parr and Andy Evans, while attending a Los Angeles Kings game at the Staples Center, were featured. The kiss drew huge cheers from the crowd.Parr told Outsports: It was a particularly sweet night since the Kings were playing and beat my hometown Toronto. My parents and siblings live in LA but the rest of my family think I am a terrible traitor for being a Kings fan; I ve lived in LA for 17 years. Not only did these fantastic men get to smooch in front of thousands of fellow King s fans, but they are also triathletes raising money for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society s Team in Training.This beautiful moment in history is wonderful and shows the progress we ve made as a nation, but it also highlights that in 2016, we re just now getting around to acknowledging that gay couples, male and female, do in fact attend sporting events.Congrats to the beautiful couple, and if you d like to donate to help their cause, go HERE.You can see the full video HERE, but here s a highlight of just the pair in their moment in history: Progress!

 CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Trump Supporter Goes RABID Against Hillary Supporters On Flight (VIDEO),"There definitely seems to be a new sense of entitlement among Donald Trump supporters now that he won the Electoral College count in the presidential election. They can t exactly say he won via popular support seeing as Hillary Clinton currently leads by over 2 million votes.However, these Trump supporting bullies are out there nonetheless, with seemingly a permission slip from the new bully-in-chief-elect, to be as awful to others as they want to be. After all, Trump was a bully to pretty much everyone and still won the election.One of the most recent examples of this bullying behavior was caught on camera.While boarding a plane, one Trump supporter was outright being plane vile to anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton. Even shouting: We got some Hillary bitches on here?! Then proceeds to say: Donald Trump! He s y alls president. Every god damn one of yas. If you don t like it, too bad. Regardless of the bad grammar or the obvious observation that he may very well be intoxicated, this sort of entitled bully behavior has been seen all over the country.What is even more startling, is that people seem to be allowing it and staying silent as he rants.We have to speak up or people like this will continue to think it s okay. This man should ve been tossed from the plane, but he wasn t. This isn t okay.Watch this Trump supporter be exactly like the bully we also know his leader to be: The epitome of post-election white privilege.

 Trump Supporter Uses Patton Oswalt’s Dead Wife To Attack Him And Gets Righteously FIRED From His Job,"Again, when will conservatives learn that their hateful social media activity can cost them their employment?Because a real estate agent in Peoria, Illinois learned that the hard way this week after he viciously attacked comedian Patton Oswalt on Twitter for posting in support of former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates after Yates was fired by Donald Trump for refusing to enforce an unconstitutional Muslim ban.Trump:  You leave this White House now!  Sally Yates rides bus to city. Becomes a taxi dancer. Leads dance revolt against pimp. Triumphs.  Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) January 31, 2017Apparently, that was enough to set off Trump supporter Tony Brust, who proceeded to attack Oswalt with a series of tweets that have since been deleted. I Tweeted out a very positive, very benign Tweet in support of Sally Yates, and her risky stand on principle, which cost her her job,  Oswalt recounted on Facebook.  The realtor s response Tweet was along the lines of,  Oh, the nasty little troll has another opinion. Stick to show business and shut up.  I m paraphrasing. Another person who hates my Twitter feed s content who nevertheless follows me. I Tweeted out something in support of someone. He reacted with immediate disgust and offense. Fine, whatever. Oswalt has dealt with hateful Trump supporters before so he is used to ignoring them. Except this time, Brust decided to make things incredibly personal and actually used Oswalt s deceased wife to attack him. I m a psychic and I m channeling his wife s opinions,  Brust wrote in response to one Twitter user who asked everyone to stop having opinions.Needless to say, the remark was a deep stab to Oswalt, who was not having a good day.His wife Michelle McNamara had passed away not even a year ago and he is still dealing with the pain of his loss.As soon as Brust posted his comment he had made a serious mistake as Twitter users were quick to inform Brust s employer of how nasty he was being on social media. Not only was this Twitter exchange very public, Brust was using his professional Twitter account to do it.Would ve happily ignored Tony Brust if he hadn t sent THIS Tweet. But he did and it caught me at a dark moment: pic.twitter.com/yflAMuSAqo  Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) January 31, 2017At that point, Oswalt began trolling Brust, and at some point, he noticed that Brust had removed his social media accounts. And then Oswalt discovered that Brust s employer had posted a notice on the company website making clear that they did not want to be associated with him and the nasty things he said.I saw that other people were giving him shit about the  dead wife  joke. I figured it was going to blow up in the poor slob s face without zero help from me. In the morning, his account was gone. He d closed it down (I assume). He d also closed down his Facebook profile and professional page. And then the realty company he worked for posted a message to their website about how Mr. Dead Wife Joke did NOT represent their company and that he was no longer employed by them.Indeed, the Chicago Tribune tracked down Michael Maloof, owner of the real estate agency, and learned that Brust had been fired. We were made aware that this had gone on and we parted company,  Maloof said.So here we are once again. Another Trump supporter/racist/conservative has been fired and he only has himself to blame. Rather than just simply disagree with Oswalt and move on, Brust chose to publicly harass a celebrity. He attacked Oswalt in a way that threatened the reputation of his employer. Because while businesses don t really care about the political affiliations of the employees, they definitely care about what their employers say and how they say it in public. The Internet is forever and while Brust deleted most of his tweets, he wasn t able to erase every one of them. And now he is unemployed for being a total dick.Conservatives have previously been fired for publicly attacking Michelle Obama using racist remarks, which cause all sorts of problems for businesses because business owners care about their reputation and image. How employees represent themselves can have positive or negative effects on the business.But since Donald trump took office, his supporters have been emboldened to say and do things that disgust the rest of civilized society. And they actually believe they can get away with it without consequences just because Trump has taken over the White House.As Oswalt concluded in his Facebook post, Trump supporters are wrong to think that way.The main thing that Trump supporters are excited about, now that he s president? Is that finally, at LOOOOOONG LAST, all of the awful things they want to say, that used to lose them friends and jobs and marriages? They re EXCITED about potentially getting to say them with ZERO repercussions. Just like Trump did. All the way into the White House. All the way into unlimited, forever power to spew any awful shit that comes to your head and no one dares correct you, rolls their eyes, or punches you in the nose.But I m afraid Peoria Realtor is going to be the first in a long line of Trumpers who will realize, on the other side of firings and divorces and black eyes, that Trump s Teflon Umbrella covers Trump and no one else.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 3, 2017"
GAG! HOLLYWOOD LATINOS Gush Over Hillary In Nevada Race Against Sanders: “I’d like to Netflix and chill with her”,"Pandering is what Hillary does best. First it was the black vote with her meeting with Al Sharpton and now it s the Latino vote in Nevada. This is such a dog and pony show! None of this matters if Hillary still wins the super delegates. At least Bill gets to have fun Hillary Clinton s campaign has received a much needed shot of glamour with actresses America Ferrera and Eva Longoria speaking at her final pre-caucus rally as Clinton made a last ditch bid to secure Nevada s Latino vote. With just hours to go before the state becomes the  first in the west  to caucus for the Democrats, and polls showing Clinton in a statistical tie with Bernie Sanders, the Latino vote has become the key demographic to win, making up 27.8 percent of the state s population. America Ferrera, 31, was the first to speak to the crowd of more than 600 supporters who had gathered on the grass of Clark County Government Center Amphitheater on the chill February evening.Flanked by a suitably diverse blend of loyalists spanning every demographic and invited to sit square in the line of cameras there to record the event, America asked:  Who s ready for Hillary? I am so ready for Hillary.  In comments designed to rebut criticisms that the campaign has notably failed to connect with young voters or convince others that Hillary possesses warmth and likability, America said:  I m a millennial, female voter and I m not only for Hillary but really like Hillary.  She s the kind of person I want to share a bottle of wine with. I really heart Hillary I d like to Netflix and chill with her. Maybe because I am an American Latina who has experienced first hand the kind of inequities Hillary has spent her career trying to fix.  She continued:  Hillary stood with Latinos even before the Latino vote was desirable. Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Feb 20, 2016"
EPA Jails 185 Americans For ‘Environmental Crimes’ But No One For Massive EPA Toxic Spill,"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcers helped convict 185 Americans of environmental crimes this year, with each of these eco-convicts getting sentenced to eight months in prison on average for crimes ranging from biofuel fraud to illegally removing asbestos. Every year, EPA agents help put dozens of Americans in prison for breaking U.S. environmental laws. Environmental crimes range from spilling coal ash into public waterways, to pretending to produce biofuels, to illegally cleaning up asbestos in buildings.Interestingly enough, EPA has not fined or jailed anyone for the spilling of three million gallons of mine wastewater in August. That month, EPA workers opened up the Gold King Mine and sent a toxic plume of mine waste though rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Toxic mine waste even went through Navajo Nation territory and resulted in farms having their water supplies shut off.Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize EPA for not taking any disciplinary action against contractors or employees involved in the Colorado mine spill. Lawmakers noted that while EPA drags its feet, a private company, like Duke, would have been fined quickly if it had spilled mine waste.The Department of the Interior s outside review of the spill incident found EPA could have avoided a blowout if it had taken precautions agency workers had used while opening other sealed Colorado mines.Interior found that had the agency used  a drill rig to bore into the mine from above  to open Gold King  the mine would have been revised, and the blowout would not have occurred. The EPA has taken responsibility for the spill, but still hasn t taken actions against agency workers who opened up the mine mouth. In fact, lawmakers are worried the agency is trying to taint a federal investigation into the spill.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Dec 31, 2015"

Insane! Huge Financial Disaster On The Horizon With Obama’s Housing Bubble And Easy Lending In The Name Of “Fairness”,"I ll bet most Americans have no idea that we re in another huge housing bubble thanks to Obama s desire for everyone to own a home. Remember Barney Frank and his pals forcing this bubble to get bigger and bigger and then pointing the finger at Republicans? Well, that s what s next unless the lame Republicans take the bull by the horns and get control of our debt. BILL CLINTON S HUD SECRETARY ANDREW CUOMO DISCUSSING FAIR HOUSING: THIS IS A MASSIVE SHELL GAME THAT OBAMA CONTINUES:Just this September, HUD  awarded $38 million to  fight housing discrimination  so the shell game continues but here s more of the rest of the story:OBAMA S HOUSE OF CARDS:  Eric Holder and Tom Perez who re Obama administration political shills, did the dirty work in targeting banks. The excerpt below is from a fantastic piece in the New York Post that spells out the Obama administration s efforts with minority home ownership and  perceived injustices  that just aren t there. Typical Obama to rewrite the rules or just not follow them to get what you want. That isn t stopping the administration from trying to correct perceived injustices. Cordray says CFPB will rewrite the rules for how the private credit bureaus collect, maintain and analyze such data. He is working on  reforming  the system with the liberal Center for Responsible Lending and other housing activists who believe it denies minorities the credit they deserve. The federal government also isn t shy about fining and suing banks to get its way. CFPB also has been working closely with the Justice Department to enhance fair lending enforcement. Justice has pressured banks to relax their mortgage underwriting standards and approve loans for minorities with poor credit as part of a new crackdown on alleged discrimination, court documents show. Attorney General Eric Holder, who served as Reno s deputy, has filed a record number of fair-lending enforcement actions against lenders. More than 60 investigations are active or said to be in the pipeline, and dozens of banks have already settled, including giants Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Prosecutions have already generated more than $550 million in rebates, loan set-asides and other subsidies from banks that have settled out of court rather than battle the federal government and risk being branded racist by the media. Leading the charge is Holder s top civil-rights cop, Thomas Perez, another Clinton retread. Perez has compared bankers to Klansmen, arguing that while bankers may discriminate  with a smile  and  fine print,  it s  every bit as destructive as the cross burned in a neighborhood. STEPHEN MOORE: The Fed, the White House and Congress are setting up the next financial bubbleMy 13-year-old son told me at the dinner table the other day that Franklin Roosevelt was one of America s  greatest presidents  because  he ended the Great Depression.  He s usually a good student, so I checked where he got this tripe and sure enough the fairy tale was right there in his American history book.Sure enough his text book tells kids that the New Deal ended the Great Depression and even saved capitalism. Of course the New Deal exacerbated the pain and financial devastation of a stock market crash, and unemployment lingered in double digits for a decade after Roosevelt was elected until the start of World War II.Here s the latest story line: bailouts, trillions of dollars of government spending and debt, easy money, and re-regulation of Wall Street ended the 2008 Great Recession. The myth took on new life last week when Ben Bernanke took a bow in The Wall Street Journal for in his mind saving the economy with his $3 trillion of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy. No, actually this is what created the crisis. Don t be surprised if Mr. Bernanke receives a Nobel Peace Prize.As Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute and other scholars have thoroughly documented, the crash of 2008 was caused by the Federal Reserve s easy money policies for nearly a decade, government housing policies that led to preposterous mortgage loans being issued, and massive overleverage of government, companies, and households.Why does any of this history matter? Since Washington doesn t understand what went wrong in 2007 and 2008, so the Fed, the White House and Congress are recreating the very same conditions for another financial bubble. If it pops, we could replay the same devastating effects as occurred during the first bubble in 1999 and 2000. It is doing so in four ways:First, the Dodd-Frank regulations are causing one of the greatest consolidations of the banking industry since the Great Depression. Those indispensable small savings and loans that Jimmy Stewart operated in the movie  It s a Wonderful Life  are disappearing from the American landscape. This is because only really big banks have the size to spread the costs of Dodd-Frank compliance officers and costs. So we have created a competitive advantage that allows the sharks to swallow the minnows. Meanwhile, the  too big to fail  safety net to Bank of America, Citi, and other titans exacerbates this cost advantage of big banks and thus makes bailouts even more likely in the future.Second, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are engaged in the same low interest rate lending mania of 2004-07 and the Obama administration is on a Bush-like home-ownership push. Some Republican House heroes like Jeb Hensarling of Texas wanted to eliminate taxpayer subsidies to Fannie and Freddie but the housing lobby kept them alive. So now the two government enterprises are back issuing taxpayer guarantees on mortgages with as little as 3 percent down payment. Have we learned nothing at all?Third, the Fed refused to raise interest rates off zero in September, and, hello, that easy money policy is how we got into the mess in 2000 and then in 2008. Wall Street cheered Janet Yellen s decision to keep the cheap dollars flowing. Isn t this all starting to sound familiar?Finally, there is the saturation of debt. When the crisis hit in 2008 the national debt stood at a little under $10 trillion. Now we are at $18 trillion. Government is hopelessly overleveraged. The interest rate exposure is enormous with each one percentage point rise in long term rates causing the servicing costs of the debt to rise by about $1 trillion over 10 years. Meanwhile, on top of that, the Fed owns at least $1 trillion in mortgage debt and so if housing markets fall again, taxpayers get double walloped.The point is that government and politicians have no learning curve. All of the conditions of financial wreckage are reappearing. This is why congressional Republicans absolutely should put up a fight on the debt ceiling by requiring more budget discipline as a condition of higher debt levels. They should require at least 8-10 percent downpayments on all government insured mortgages. They should repeal all or part of the Dodd-Frank bill that is destroying community banks, while promising voters they will never again bail out a bank or financial institution. Finally, they should be urging the Fed to restore sound money by gradually raising short term interest rates. And the presidential candidates should start warning voters that Washington is rebuilding another financial house of cards.If they don t, when the financial crash comes and Americans see their life savings disappear, the media and the history books will again blame Republicans for the destruction from the rampant financial negligence of government.

"US admits not targeting Al Nusra, then blames Moscow for separating ‘moderates’ from terrorists","21st Century Wire says While Russian and Syrian forces are doing the real work of actually fighting terrorists in Syria   the United States is arming, funding and training jihadists. In reality, the US failed to fulfill any of its ceasefire commitments in Syria. In fact, the US destroyed any hope of an agreement when it carried out a vicious airstrike killing upwards of 100 Syrian soldiers on Sept 17th.It s just a little bit rich for the ethically and morally challenged political detritus in Washington DC to be blaming Russia for not doing more to separate the  moderates  from the terrorists. Maybe that s because there is no  moderate opposition  in Syria. This is just a piece of fiction that Washington is trying to preserve in order to prop up its diplomatic facade regarding Syria. In the eyes of the Syrian state, if the opposition is armed, then they cannot rightly be called  moderates . This would be the same in the United States, or Great Britain.This hypocrisy, and Washington s adolescent insistence on playing semantic name games when referring to  moderate opposition  and  moderate rebels  are mere euphemisms for moderate terrorists.Despite all of this, CIA director John Brennan wants to keep talking tough, by threatening Russia: I think that pushing back against a bully is appropriate,  Brennan told Reuters.  I think that is very different than rushing in and bombing the hell out of a place.  CAUGHT ON TAPE: John Kerry s UN audio leak proved that the Secretary of State has been lying all along, to the Russians, the Syrians, the world, and to the US electorate that pays his salary. Kerry also admitted on tape that the US was arming and training terrorists in Syria.We know now that from the beginning of Washington s illegal entry into Syria airspace, their plan was to spare Al-Nusra and to keep it  just in case  for Plan B. Watch this recent clip where an Al-Nusra commander testifies on how the US supports jihadists in Syria in the form of arms, tanks and artillery: RTThe US is not targeting al-Nusra terrorists in Syria because they have become too  intermingled  with moderates and civilians, the US State Department claimed, accusing Moscow of causing the mess which prevents Washington from separating the groups.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov once again stressed in an interview with the BBC on Friday that Washington never delivered on its obligation to separate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (known before the rebranding as al-Nusra Front) and other extremist groups from the so-called  moderate  rebels, to whom the US provides support.However, this time Lavrov went a step further and implied that Washington has been sparing terrorists in Syria on purpose, should they ever come in handy in terms of potentially overthrowing the government of Bashar Assad. They still, in spite of many repeated promises and commitments   are not able or not willing to do this and we have more and more reasons to believe that from the very beginning the plan was to spare al-Nusra and to keep it just in case for  Plan B    when it would be time to change the regime,  the Russian minister said.The US State Department has dismissed Lavrov s statements as absurd , instead accusing Russia of driving the  moderate opposition to intermingle with terrorist fighters on the battlefield against the Syrian government forces.Claiming that the US exerted every possible effort to influence and separate moderates from terrorists, State Departments spokesman Mark Toner told reporters at a daily briefing on Friday, that the  moderate opposition  have been  driven more or less into the arms  and have no other choice but to  turn to Nusra, fight side by side. Toner admitted that the US had not targeted al-Nusra for months because its members had become  intermingled  with other groups and civilians. We did carry out strikes initially, back in 2014-2015, against Nusra. But absolutely, you re correct in that, as they became intermingled and as they became intermingled in civilian areas, we ve always sought to limit the possibility of civilian casualties in any of our airstrikes,  Toner said Continue this story at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",US_News,"October 4, 2016"

He said he wanted to publish an op-ed last month arguing that President Trump likely didn t attempt to obstruct justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey.  I said that I thought the readers of the New York Times were entitled to hear or read the other side of the issue whether there were crimes committed,  he said.

WAS IRANIAN BUSINESSMAN FREED FROM JAIL After HUGE Payoff To Clintons?,"Just before an Iranian-American businessman was freed from jail in Iran in Oct. 2010, his son met with Bill Clinton and also made the first of what would become more than $1 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation.Nima Taghavi, who owns businesses in California, grew impatient in 2010 with negotiations to secure his father Reza s release from an Iranian prison, and so he turned to the former president for help.To arrange the meeting with Clinton, Taghavi first contacted Doug Band, who worked as Clinton s  body man,  has counseled the Clinton Foundation, and co-founded Teneo Holdings, a consulting group that Clinton advised.Taghavi met with the former president in hopes that he would serve as special envoy to Iran, sources told TheDC. And through his personal charity, the Nima Taghavi Foundation, the businessman gave a $5,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation in 2010. He would go on to give more than $1 million over the next several years.The timing of the meeting and the first round of donations raises two questions: whether Clinton promised to help Taghavi in exchange for contributions to his family s organization and whether he violated an agreement not to personally solicit funds for his charity.As part of the deal to bring Hillary Clinton on board as secretary of state, the Clintons signed a memorandum of understanding in Dec. 2008 agreeing to the stipulation that Bill Clinton not raise money.It is unclear if Hillary Clinton knew of her husband s meeting with Taghavi. In an email informing Clinton that an unnamed Iranian-American businessman had been released from an Iran jail Clinton asked her aide Huma Abedin who the prisoner was. Abedin informed her it was Reza Taghavi.In an email with the subject  Why Taghavi was released,  a State Department official wrote  I understand [Clinton] is asking. The theory of a Clinton-related quid pro quo   whether Hillary Clinton knew about it or not   is not unfounded, as it fits a pattern of the former first couple providing favors and access to donors to their charity and to their various political campaigns.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"May 6, 2016"

But earlier this week, the city ordered Saturday s rally to be relocated out of Emancipation Park to a larger one, further out of the city, citing safety reasons.Kessler on grounds of free speech and on Friday a judge granted a preliminary injunction which allowed the rally of white nationalists and other extremists to take place at its originally planned location downtown. They rescinded permission,  he said.  We fought them in federal court and we beat them in federal court. (But) it upended all our security arrangements. He went on to  condemn the violence yesterday  and said he  would like to disavow any folks getting hurt  but he was quickly drowned out by the boos and jeers of the crowd.Suddenly the crowd closed in, and police surrounding him, rushed Kessler away and brought him to a nearby police station as a voice was heard over the crowd, shouting  We don t want a mob, we don t want a mob, As Kessler was whisked away, many demanded to know why the police were protecting him.As he was led away, he told reporters:  I disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic.

BREAKING: MI Court Of Appeals Orders Vote Recount To STOP…Jill Stein’s Democrat Activist Attorney Says Count Must Go On,"The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Green Party candidate Jill Stein s request for a recount of presidential ballots in Michigan.The court ruled that the Board of State Canvassers should not have allowed the recount, because Stein has not chance of winning the presidential election due to the recount. Accordingly, we grant the requests of the Attorney General and President-Elect Trump for issuance of a writ of mandamus,  a court official said in a statement.  We direct the Board of State Canvassers to reject the Nov. 30, 2016 petition of candidate Stein that precipitated the current recount process. We retain jurisdiction. The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed that Jill Stein is not an aggrieved candidate and the recount must stop.  A.G. Bill Schuette (@SchuetteOnDuty) December 7, 2016The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the federal judge s order to continue the hand recount, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the recount process.The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals made clear, in their ruling, that  If, subsequently, the Michigan courts determine that Plaintiffs  recount is improper under Michigan state law for any reason, we expect the district court to entertain any properly filed motions to dissolve or modify its order in this case. The combined effect of the two rulings appears to set up further court proceedings in front of Goldsmith and the Michigan Republican Party has already filed for another federal hearing. Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for Schuette, said the Michigan Court of Appeals said  there is no conflict between  its order and the federal district court s temporary restraining order, so the recount should end immediately.However,  to ensure clarity for Michigan taxpayers, (and as recommended in the 6th Circuit s opinion issued this evening), the Attorney General is now filing in the federal district court a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order,  Bitely said.Mark Brewer, an attorney for Stein, said the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stay the Republicans  request to stop the recount, so it will continue until all the parties can get back to federal court to plead their case, again, before Goldsmith.The state panel said that to qualify as  aggrieved,  Stein  must be able to allege a good faith belief that but for mistake or fraud,  she would have had a reasonable chance of winning.    Legal InsurectionOpponents of the recount claim that it s too expensive and that Stein, who received just 1 percent of the vote, is wasting resources. This is a win for Michigan taxpayers,  Michigan Republican Party chairman Ronna Romney McDaniel said in a statement.  The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in our favor, determining that the petition for recount filed by Dr. Jill Stein should have been denied. Dr. Stein is not an aggrieved candidate as she has no chance of winning the election in Michigan. The legal arguments are being heard in both state and federal courts, and the attorney general said the battle could theoretically end up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. I m just saying, theoretically, it could go there,  Schuette said.  I m just taking it just one step at a time, and I m convinced, and I have confidence in the Michigan court system, and the Michigan judicial system, to uphold the Michigan statute, and the Michigan law will prevail. Schuette said the battle is a matter for the state courts because he said there is no U.S. constitutional right to a recount.Stein s campaign handed the Michigan secretary of state a check for $973,250 on Wednesday. The campaign said it intends to pay all fees associated with the recount in Michigan, and is currently recruiting volunteers to observe the hand recounts that are likely to take place in 19 sites, representing all 83 counties across the state.Meanwhile, Michigan Republicans said the request for a hand recount of presidential votes could cost taxpayers up to $12 million, a dozen times more than Stein will have to pay.I m not sure why the votes that were counted by machines that were said to be counting votes more than once (and perhaps even multiple times) in a heavily Democratic county are allowed to stand in the final count and will NOT be recounted. Why were those voted included in the final vote that was CERTIFIED by the state of MI?Watch at the end when the reporter asks the election official if MI residents should be concerned about those votes and he simply glosses over his question: ",left-news,"Dec 7, 2016"
NEW APP GIVES WOMEN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT ‘GUILT FREE’ ABORTIONS: ‘I’ve had 5 abortions because I love getting pregnant but just not ready for kids.’,"Wow maybe they could include a place where the  mothers  could pose with their dead babies a photo gallery of sorts Women all over the world have opened up on the still relatively taboo subject of abortion on secret-sharing app Whisper.Finding relief in the anonymity aspect of the app, individuals took the opportunity to reveal their true unabashed feelings on the termination of their pregnancies.Without censorship, frank confessions varied from lack of remorse, to one woman even admitting that she visited a nightclub the very same day.Whisper is an online community that allows anonymous users to share and comment on each other s secrets, allowing individuals to air their emotions without any fear of retribution. Women of all ages, who admitted to not regretting their decision to have an abortion, were asked to shed a light on their thought processes and emotions.One woman talked about her unshakable stance, citing:  Having an abortion was the easiest decision of my life. Another individual revealed her own extensive and unbridled history with terminating pregnancies, stating:  I ve had 5 abortions because I love getting pregnant but just not ready for kids. Many of the Whisper users talked about other people s projection of guilt or regret, that they had failed to experience themselves. One confused woman wrote:  Sometimes I feel guilty over the fact that I feel no guilt about my abortion. A rather shocking confession came from a woman that continued on with her party lifestyle after the often exhausting procedure:  I had an abortion a week ago. I don t feel the slightest bit of guilt, I even went out to a club on the same day. Here are some women who shared their thoughts on abortion:Here s a  woman  who in 2010 made a Youtube video to share her  positive  experience about her abortion. She finishes her video by saying:  I hope everyone on Youtube has a great and godless day. Another Whisper user talked about how time passing had no effect on the feeling of regret with her decision:  5 years and I ve not once felt regret for my abortion. No regret, no guilt, no second thoughts, nothing. Another added:  I ve had two abortions in two years. I keep waiting for the guilt to come, but so far I feel nothing. Others used the opportunity as an emotional outlet to directly  speak  to people who had judged them.One woman argued:  I don t regret my abortion regardless of how much you think I should. Some women even went so far to express the happiness at their decision, with one woman adding:  I ve had 5 abortions and I don t feel bad or sad about any of them I was kinda happy. Similarly, another woman compared her own sensations of relief and happiness to other people s darker experience, writing:  I actually find it strange how depressed people get after having an abortion. I don t regret mine one bit, let alone feel depressed about it. Via: UK Daily Mail",politics,"Jul 7, 2015"

So much for liberating poor kids from failing schools While the media chase the Bernie Sanders rallies, keep your eye on the political crowds that matter.

" Republicans Surrender To Trump, Fear Historic Loss Of Senate And House","The Washington Post reports that the Republicans and the billionaires that own them are more or less writing off the White House as a total loss and rushing to hold onto both the House and the Senate. They re afraid, and for good reason, that if when Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee, he s going to be crushed so badly in the general election that he ll deliver both chambers of Congress to the Democratic Party:The efforts are being driven by major players such as the Koch brothers  political network, which has already begun laying groundwork in Colorado, Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the Crossroads organizations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The behemoth Koch operation   which aims to spend almost $900 million before the November elections   is now considering abandoning Trump as a nominee and focusing its resources on behalf of GOP congressional candidates.My colleague Korie Beth Brown wrote about how Trump is putting the heavily gerrymandered House into play and this move by the GOP Donor Class confirms it: Trump is leading the Republican Party to electoral annihilation.Hooray!According to WaPo, instead of dumping a billion dollars into winning the White House, the Kochs and their fellow oligarchs are planning to spend all of that money just to keep what they already have:A key element of the strategy will be a springtime wave of television ads that slam Democratic contenders and tout Republican incumbents as attuned to hometown concerns. Strategists hope the efforts will help inoculate congressional candidates against association with Trump s incendiary remarks. If there are crosscurrents that are potentially harmful, the most important thing you can do is aggressively localize the race   the things that matter back home, the problems you re solving,  said Steven Law, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who leads the American Crossroads super PAC and a suite of related groups.While that sounds like a good idea, Republicans no longer actually SOLVE problems. Instead, they create them and then blame Obama and the Democrats. When your entire strategy has been unprecedented obstruction for 7 years, it s going to be hard to tout your accomplishments.Even with all of that advertising, it s going to be very difficult to get conservatives to be enthusiastic about voting with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. Combine that with the abject horror that liberals and Independents will experience and you re looking at a huge turnout from the left matched against a depressed turnout from the right. And no, Hillary Clinton does not inspire the same kind of loathing no matter how loudly Bernie supporters insist she does.Republicans and their puppet masters have every right to be afraid of a blue tidal wave that will make the red wave of 2010 look like a drop in the bucket. The question then becomes: Will Democrats be able to hold on to both chambers for the midterm or will lazy Democratic voters throw away all of their gains again?Featured image via the laughably bigoted barbwire.com",News,"March 24, 2016"

Hillary Clinton: ‘Israel First’ (and no peace for Middle East),"Robert Fantina CounterpunchAlthough the United States is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. It is a good sign that, despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the Democratic side, the coronation she expected isn t going to happen.One might say that this writer focuses too much on Mrs. Clinton s adoration of Israel. But by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation, one gets a clear view of some broader, very troubling perspectives that Mrs. Clinton seems to hold.On January 6, an opinion piece appeared in The Jewish Journal, written by Mrs. Clinton. It is a fawning, maudlin essay, typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the U.S. who knows they must pay homage to their Israeli lord and master. A few points from this essay tell much about Mrs. Clinton. I m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside Israel itself   brutal stabbings, shootings, and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank alone by settler and IOF (Israel Occupation Force) terrorists is at a ten-year high. Why is Mrs. Clinton not  especially concerned  about the continuing wave of violence against Palestinians, in an area that even the U.S. says Israel occupies illegally? Do not these vicious attacks  seek to sow fear among the innocent ? Only a two-state solution negotiated between the parties can provide Palestinians independence, sovereignty, and dignity, and provide Israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic Jewish state. Why, oh why, does Mrs. Clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement? The borders of the Jewish state are recognized by most of the world, including the United Nations, and consist of those determined prior to 1967. There is nothing to negotiate. Does Mrs. Clinton disdain international law? It appears that she feels Israel, like the U.S. in its international dealings, is, indeed, above the law. BIBI FIRST: Hillary Clinton will never tell Israel  no .And this writer must point out, once again, that negotiations, which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so, can only be effective when each side wants something the other has, that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has. Israel wants all of Palestine, and takes it, piece by piece, with complete impunity. Why should Palestine agree to pointless negotiations?Mrs. Clinton refers to the  secure and recognized  borders of a Jewish state, but does not seem to consider the  secure and recognized  borders of a Palestinian state. We must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize Israel. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, known as BDS, is the latest front in this battle. BDS demonizes Israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares Israel to South African apartheid.  That s wrong and this campaign should end. The most significant efforts to delegitimize Israel are made by Israel itself. Its racist society, wherein Israeli Jews have more rights than anyone else in Israel; its apartheid system of segregation; its complete disdain for the human rights of the Palestinians; the racist, murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country, and demonize it, and rightly so. Israel is often compared to South African apartheid, and the comparison is valid.And it is not just in the context of Palestine and Israel that Mrs. Clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty. Her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom: We must work with our friends and partners to deny ISIS territory in the Middle East, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, and toughen our defenses at home.  We can t just contain ISIS   we must defeat ISIS. Is that really the U.S. s goal? Garikai Chengu, a researcher at Harvard University, suggested in September of 2014 that ISIS  is made-in-the-USA, an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oil-rich Middle East and to counter Iran s growing influence in the region. In a June, 2015 column in The Guardian, Associate Editor Seumas Milne said this:  [T]he U.S. and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups; they were prepared to countenance the creation of some sort of  Islamic state    despite the  grave danger  to Iraq s unity   as a Sunni buffer to weaken Syria.

OUCH! NEW EMAILS Show Hillary Didn’t Want To Fly In Same Plane As Michelle Obama,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton once requested to fly in a separate plane rather than share one with then-First Lady Michelle Obama, according to newly released emails.The email exchange was part of a new batch of emails that government watchdog Judicial Watch obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Clinton and her top aide, Huma Abedin, discussed in a July 2011 exchange Clinton s plans to attend the funeral of fellow former First Lady Betty Ford in Grand Rapids, Mich. Looks like plane won t be an issue,  Abedin wrote.  Also, looks like Michelle Obama also going. Is it ok [sic] that we and Mrs. O take two separate planes?  Clinton asked. I think it s ok [sic]. But let me see what kind of plane she s taking,  Abedin responded. I would rather have our own of course,  Clinton added.The new emails surfaced after other messages, ones released during the 2016 presidential campaign, revealed that Clinton and Obama s husband, former President Barack Obama, had an antagonistic relationship. And she HATES that the president ( that man,  as the Clintons call him) kicked her ass in 2008,  Democratic megadonor Jeffrey Leeds wrote to former Secretary of State Colin Powell in March 2015.  She can t believe it or accept it. Leeds also addressed the growing controversy over Clinton s use of a private email server at the State Department, writing that then-President Obama would not care if Clinton found herself in legal trouble. I don t think the president would weep if she found herself in real legal trouble. She ll pummel his legacy if she gets a chance and he knows it,  Leeds said.The exchange between Clinton and Abedin came after another message, one also released during the 2016 election, showed that Clinton complained commercial flights were  burdensome  and asked Abedin to get the Air Force to fly her from Westchester, N.Y. back to Washington, D.C.

WOW! Donna Brazile Was Warned To Protect Herself After Seth Rich Murder…When Brazile Asked Hillary To Use Some of Her Millions To Help Find Rich’s Murderer…Hillary Abruptly Ended Phone Call,"Is former DNC Chair Donna Brazile attempting to tie Hillary to the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich in her new book  Hacks ? What does Brazile know? Is she in danger if she says too much? Is Brazile offering just enough information, so that authorities are pressured into looking into a connection with Hillary and Seth Rich s murder?  From her book  Hacks :I felt some responsibility for Seth Rich s death. I didn t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights. With all I knew now about the Russians  hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder. Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer and I worried that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town. [My friend] Elaine expressed her doubts about that, and I heard her. The FBI said that they did not see any Russian fingerprints there.Daily Caller   Brazile repeatedly returns to the subject of being haunted by Rich s murder, even though other Democrats have pounced on anyone who suggested that the murder was anything other than a robbery gone wrong. The DNC data staffer was killed days before Wikileaks began publishing its emails, and his valuables were not taken.100 Percent Fed Up   The private investigator, Rod Wheeler, who was hired by the Rich family to get to the bottom of the murder of their son, DNC staffer Seth Rich, offered startling information on the Rich murder case when he appeared on the Sean Hannity show on May 15, 2017.  Wheeler spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says that a  high ranking official at the DNC  wanted to know why he was snooping around.Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? Shorty after WND wrote a story that outed Donna Brazile as the  high ranking DNC representative who allegedly called the police to ask why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, Twitter SUSPENDED WND s account!Here s the title and an excerpt from the WND article:BOMBSHELL: DONNA BRAZILE WARNED OFF PRIVATE EYE ON SETH RICH MURDEREx-DNC chairwoman reportedly asked cops why investigator is  snooping  into mysterious case Alicia Powe and Liz Crokin wrote the story that was also posted to and deleted from the social media platform by Twitter: Former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile is the high-ranking DNC representative who allegedly called police and the family of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich and demanded to know why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, the private eye revealed to WND Monday. The high-ranking DNC official that called the police after I inquired about Rich s case was Donna Brazile,  veteran homicide detective Rod Wheeler told WND.  Why shouldn t I reveal who it was? Brazile, who was also a CNN contributor and a Hillary for America donor at the time, was caught providing Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton with questions that would later be asked of Clinton at a televised CNN town hall. In an interview with Fox News before the election, Brazile denied leaking the questions to Clinton. But in a March 17, 2017, column for Time magazine, she finally admitted doing so, saying it was a  mistake I will forever regret. According to WND, their Twitter account was suspended because of this Seth Rich investigation bombshell.Daily Caller   But Brazile says she had a  spook,  with connections to the intelligence community, who told her after the killing that she needed protection for herself, including cameras, alarms and backup power at her house, and that she heeded his advice.I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don t forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her. Did she want to contribute to Seth s reward fund? We still hadn t found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright young DNC staffer. You re right, she said. We re going to get to that. But she really had to go. She had made the call and checked it off her list, and I accepted after we said our goodbyes that I might never hear from her again.",left-news,"Nov 7, 2017"
MAJOR LIBERAL RAG RELUCTANTLY PUBLISHES Article On President Trump’s Outstanding Accomplishments…It’s How They Explain His Successes That Has Everyone Laughing,"The Atlantic, a publication that wouldn t know unbiased journalism if it bit them in the a$$ published what appears to be a reluctant piece on President Trump s outstanding accomplishments during his first 6 months in office. Most of the people reading this piece by The Atlantic are fans of their writing because they ve bought into the progressive, anti-American sentiment they were fed like crack cocaine in college. Almost like the patch that smokers wear to help them get through the withdrawal of nicotine while going through a cessation program, The Atlantic provides their readers with enough anti-Trump propaganda to keep them in business, while acting like a support group for their readers, who fear every anti-American piece of legislation Barack Obama worked so hard to implement, is all unraveling, thanks to this guy who  foolishly  wants  Make America Great Again . Of course, in the eyes of The Atlantic reader, America was never great to begin with.The parts where The Atlantic talks about President Trump s accomplishments are italicized and the comments the writer makes to counter Trump s successes have been highlighted.The Atlantic starts out the article by giving credit to Trump s  shadow government , as somehow being responsible for his amazing successes in his first 6 months. According to The Atlantic, the  actual government  is the fake news stories and the obsession with negative chatter surrounding Trump s presidency, while President Trump s accomplishments have been hidden in the  shadows .The Atlantic  Imagine, if you will, that there is a shadow government.The actual government, the administration of Donald Trump, is coming off the worst week of his presidency, although there haven t been any smooth weeks. Trump s top legislative priority, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, seems dead for the moment. (Tax reform? Forget it.) His administration has set a new standard for chaos and dysfunction, rolling through staffers the way other administrations run through, well, legislative initiatives. Trump s foreign policy remains inchoate and ineffective. Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation looms over the entire administration, threatening both its legitimacy and legal jeopardy for some of its members.Things are going considerably better for the shadow government. With the Trump administration s chaos sucking up all the attention, it s been able to move forward on a range of its priorities, which tend to be more focused on regulatory matters anyway. It is remaking the justice system, rewriting environmental rules, overhauling public-lands administration, and greenlighting major infrastructure projects. It is appointing figures who will guarantee the triumph of its ideological vision for decades to come. let s consider the Trump administration s accomplishments. Spoiler alert: like climate change, they re real.One of the two biggest victories has come on border security, which was one of Trump s top campaign priorities. Border crossings have already plummeted, suggesting that rhetoric making it clear to immigrants that they are not welcome is effective in its own right. Customs and Border Protections report that apprehensions of unauthorized people are down nearly 20 percent from the same time in 2016. (Trump continues to radically exaggerate these figures, though.) This decline has occurred despite Trump being foiled on his actual policy proposals at the border. Construction hasn t begun on his border wall yet, and federal courts have repeatedly smacked down his Muslim travel ban.That said, he did get one good result in courts and that points to a second area of success. The Supreme Court allowed parts of the travel ban to go forward, in a victory that would not have happened without Neil Gorsuch on the court, filling a seat that under all previous customs would have been filled by Barack Obama s appointee Merrick Garland. Given his legislative struggles, the most enduring Trump victories are likely to come in the judicial branch.Trump may get to appoint several more justices to the high court. And in the meantime, he s filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees. As the veteran Democratic official Ron Klain wrote recently,  A massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary. For while President Trump is incompetent at countless aspects of his job, he is proving wildly successful in one respect: naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record-setting numbers. There are the quiet, far-reaching changes. Getting back to Pruitt, the environment is one of the places where the Trump administration has had its largest impact. The most prominent move was Trump s June 1 announcement that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. But the EPA is moving on other fronts as well. It s working to dismantle Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan, a signature policy aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. In June, following a February executive order from Trump, the EPA began the process of rescinding the 2015 Waters of the United States rule, which aimed at protecting smaller bodies of water and streams in the same way that larger ones had been. In December, in the closing weeks of his administration, Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and parts of the Atlantic Ocean; the Trump administration promptly set about undoing that ban. (How interested oil companies will be remains to be seen.)The New York Times found in June that Pruitt s EPA  has moved to undo, delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules, a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency s 47-year history.  And it might have done more if not for constraints imposed by judges. EPA tried to abandon an Obama-era rule on methane emissions, but a court on Monday forced it to continue enforcing the rule.Other agencies are also in on the environmental deregulation act. The State Department reversed an Obama-era decision, clearing the way for the Keystone XL pipeline to begin construction. The Interior Department is considering reversing a rule on fracking on public lands, and might also reverse some equipment regulations on offshore drilling equipment implemented after the 2010 Gulf oil spill. The department has rolled back a ban on coal mining on public lands.Although the Justice Department had staunchly opposed a Texas voting law that has repeatedly been smacked down by courts as discriminatory, Sessions switched the department s position, and it has now told courts the law ought to be allowed to remain. The attorney general has also sought to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities, though his legal authority to do so is disputed.Curiously, since he campaigned as an atypically LGBT-friendly Republican, Trump has also made a range of changes on gay issues. Last week alone, the Justice Department announced that sexual orientation was not covered by Section VII, and the president said that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military. The administration has also rejected Obama-era protections for transgender students. ",left-news,"Aug 5, 2017"
 Chris Hardwick Lampoons Sarah Palin By Comparing Her To The Perfect Cartoon Character (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin went full Looney Tunes on Tuesday and @Midnight host Chris Hardwick knows exactly which character she channeled during her speech.During Wednesday night s episode of the Comedy Central program, Hardwick kicked off the show with footage from Sarah Palin s endorsement of Republican billionaire presidential wannabe Donald Trump.While not denying that her whole speech was a rambling incoherent rant, one particular part of the speech caught Hardwick s attention. Yesterday, Donald Trump received a significant endorsement from feral snow-MILF Sarah Palin,  Hardwick began.  Sadly, no one could really understand it. Hardwick then played a clip on a Vine showing a piece of Palin s crazy speech, the full transcript of which you can read here. How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment. Right. It was an attack on President Obama s past statement about bitter conservatives who cling to their guns and religion, but Hardwick couldn t resist mocking Palin. You betcha!  Hardwick said imitating Palin s voice.  You gosh-darn betcha! What with the flim-flammin , sock-darnin  every kinda woof-wrestlin , moose cobbler coolin  on the windowsill, baseball chuckin , flag-wavers, troop salutin , country lovin  anthem hummers, and no to the gays. But somehow, that nonsense sounds kinda familiar,  Hardwick continued before playing a clip of the gun-slinging mustachioed Looney Tunes character Yosemite Sam throwing a temper tantrum in the same way Palin said her line about right-wingers, which drew laughs from the audience.Hardwick then asked the three comedians standing in front of him to define what  bitter clingin , proud clingers  are. I have no clue but I m sure they re uncomfortable around black people,  James Davis replied, drawing a chuckle from Hardwick.Jen Kirkman ended the segment by saying that it s  a lizard that clings to a tree during a hurricane and blames Mexicans for everything. Here s the video via YouTube:This is an absolutely perfect comparison. It could also be said that Palin and conservatives like her could be compared to Elmer Fudd or Wyle E. Coyote as well. Regardless, Sarah Palin s drunken incoherent rants are comedy gold and Chris Hardwick hit the jackpot.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 21, 2016"

 New Research Shows Trump’s Border Wall Will Be Even MORE Worthless Than We Thought (DETAILS)," Build the wall! Build the wall!  Supposedly nobody builds better walls than Donald Trump, and the government is already hard at work acquiring the land and materials necessary to build a wall that s likely to do nothing to stop people from crossing the southern border. Now, a new study shows that the border wall may also be more a more unjustified waste of money than ever.Illegal immigration has been falling since 2007, but this latest bit of research out of the University of California, San Diego, says it will continue to fall. It s partly because of Obama   contrary to what xenophobic conservatives say, Obama did not favor or enable an open border. He made stemming the flow of immigrants a priority of his administration. The right wing is pissed because he also worked to protect people who were already here.However, the biggest causes of the drop are actually far more subtle and beyond the control of even the most hard-line, xenophobic White House. Economic trends, such as falling demand for low-skilled workers, play a huge role too. That s a long-term trend that these researchers don t see reversing itself anytime soon.There s also a major demographic component to this   our baby boom ended rather quickly in the early 1960s. However, in Latin America, it fell off far more gradually, resulting in a much larger number of younger Latin American workers who could find better opportunities here, in the 1990s and early 2000s, than in their home countries.That also is no longer true. The birth rate in Latin America is now about the same as ours, resulting in a falloff in the number of people trying to come here for opportunity. Furthermore, the population of undocumented immigrants that we do have is aging. Over the next few decades, they ll be forced to either start paying ridiculous medical bills out of pocket, or they ll find themselves forced to return to their home countries.If you combine these factors, the number of people trying to cross the border illegally will continue to drop. In fact, the researchers believe it will fall sharply over the next 20 years even without a wall.And yet, here s Trump and all his loyal subjects still chanting that a wall, which will cost anywhere from $21 billion to $70 billion and take years to build, is absolutely necessary to securing the border. But nobody actually knows how much money we could waste on this wall because no reliable estimates exist. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, there are too  many variables that are currently unknown  to be able to accurately estimate this cost.Yet they re asking for $2.6 billion for just 71 miles of new barriers for FY2018. That s a lot of money for less than 100 miles of barrier.We already knew that we, the taxpayers, were going to foot the bill for something that s probably not going to work. But now we re going to foot the bill for something that isn t just ineffective, but is wholly unnecessary.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump Supporter HAMMERS Trump For Committing Treason By Defending Russia,"Russia committed espionage against our country and got caught by the CIA, but Donald Trump is desperately defending his buddy Putin to salvage his legitimacy.Seventeen intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered with our election to help Trump win. Now Russia has the puppet in the White House they have always wanted.Americans are outraged and lawmakers from both political parties are demanding an investigation by Congress. Because if it s confirmed by Congress that Russia helped Trump win, the election results should be invalidated and we should hold a new election or install Hillary Clinton as the rightful winner for the sake of election integrity.But Trump and his team are denying that Russia interfered and are insisting that we should just ignore the facts and move on.And that isn t sitting well with former Tea Party congressman Joe Walsh.Earlier this week, Walsh took to Twitter to personally call for an investigation and blasted Trump for not having the balls to call for one himself.Every Republican swore to defend us against our enemies, including a foreign attack on our electionsAny Republican who won t should resign  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 11, 2016I ve said over and over that I d support Trump when he s right & call him out when he s wrong.Well he s wrong about Russia. Dead wrong.  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 12, 2016Well, Walsh appeared on CNN on Monday night and tore into Trump for defending Russia instead of believing our intelligence agencies. I m outraged at the lack of outrage, especially on my side, the Republican side,  Walsh said.  I get that the country is divided, but my god, a foreign government interfered with our election. That should piss everybody off. Indeed, anyone who cares about our country should be outraged.But Walsh continued blasting Trump and his Republican supporters, much to the surprise of host Brooke Baldwin. It s like because our guy won, Trump won, we re going to keep our mouths shut,  Walsh said.  I mean that s just so wrong. Walsh went on to say that  it s a fact  that Russia meddled in our political process and said Trump should  be ashamed of himself  because he s acting like a traitor by siding with Russia over our own intelligence community. For Donald Trump to come out and attack our men and women in the CIA, that s almost treasonous. Russia attacks us and Trump attacks the CIA. He ought to be the one calling for an investigation. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should not be allowed to take office until a full investigation has come to a conclusion. Our democratic process is too sacred to just ignore the fact that Russia helped Trump win and now they have a puppet they can bend to their will.

" BOMBSHELL: Trump’s Presidential Campaign Is Nearly BROKE, It’s Going To Be A Bloodbath","When Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign he bragged that because was worth  $10 billion  he would not have to concern himself with raising money and could self-finance his campaign. Thanks to his weak competition in the Republican primary, Trump did not have to spend much to get an advantage over rival campaigns and Super PACs, but in the general election it is unlikely that Trump can get by simply based on tweets and bombast as he did with Bush, Cruz, and Rubio.On Monday night Trump filed his finance report with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the failure of his campaign to bring in money is nothing less than amazing.In May of 2016, Trump only raised $3.1 million from contributors and loaned his campaign an additional $2.2 million. At the end of the month the campaign only had a shocking $1.3 million dollars in cash on hand.As journalists quickly pointed out, Trump s fundraising more likely resembled a House member with  a semi-competitive seat  or  a safe Senate seat in a deep red state.  The numbers are definitely not the sort of figures associated with a national presidential campaign.The results look even worse compared to Hillary Clinton. At the end of May, her campaign had $42 million on hand, an amazing disparity of $40 million between the two campaigns.And while donors have said they are still unable to determine which Super PAC to donate to in order to support Trump, the Super PAC backing Clinton, Priorities USA, had its biggest month ever with $12 million in donations.Even compared to fellow Republicans, Trump s numbers are pathetic. In May of 2012, Mitt Romney s presidential campaign and the Republican Party raised $78 million dollars. The current GOP only raised $12 million this May.Defunct campaigns like Ben Carson s currently have $7.4 million on hand, more than Trump s active campaign.There are also some weird expenditures from the Trump campaign found in the FEC reports. He appears to be redirecting some money back towards himself.His campaign paid $423,371 for the use of Trump s own house the Mar-A-Lago mansion and club in Florida.Even stranger, Trump seems to be drawing a salary from his campaign, a very unusual arrangement especially for someone claiming to be a  billionaire.  The filings find that Trump is regularly being paid $2,574 as part of  payroll  for the campaign.Featured image via Flickr",News,"June 20, 2016"

HILLARY WORKED FEVERISHLY To Return 10 Russian Spies Operating In U.S. In Midst Of Selling 20% Of U.S. Uranium To Russia,"Why is this not front page news on every major media outlet?Russian intelligence targeted Hillary Clinton before she became secretary of state in 2009, FBI documents show.New FBI information about corruption in a Clinton-approved uranium deal with Russia raises questions about Clinton s actions after the FBI broke up a deep-cover Russian spy ring in 2010.For a decade, the FBI ran an operation called Ghost Stories to monitor and rip apart a deep-cover Russian agent network. Ghost Stories tracked a ring Russian spies who lived between Boston and Washington, D.C., under false identities. It was one of the FBI s most elaborate and successful counterintelligence operations in history.After the FBI arrested 10 of the spies in June, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton worked feverishly to return the Russian agents to Moscow in a hastily arranged, lopsided deal with Putin.It all happened as the uranium deal was in play: An arrangement to provide Moscow s state Rosatom nuclear agency with 20 percent of American uranium capacity, with $145,000,000 to pour into the Clinton Family Foundation and its projects.For the Clintons, the FBI s biggest counterintelligence bust in history couldn t have come at a worse time.The day the FBI arrested the Russian agents, on June 28, 2010, the day before the secretary of state s husband, Bill Clinton, was to give a speech in Moscow. A Kremlin-connected investment bank, Renaissance Capital, paid the former president $500,000 for the hour-long appearance.An unnamed Hillary Clinton spokesman told ABC News that there was  no reason to think the Secretary was a target of this spy ring. That was a lie.Under the code name Operation Ghost Stories, the FBI had been working the ring for a decade. Its targets had burrowed in along the Acela Corridor between Boston, New York, and Washington DC. They lived normal daily lives as Americans to attend universities, run businesses, marry, and conceive and raise children to infiltrate society and subvert government institutions. One of the SVR agents had stolen the identity of a six-week-old Canadian baby who had died in 1963. That prompted the Ghost Stories code name. The ring inspired the FX network s television series,  The Americans. As with any secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would be a primary target under any circumstance. But she was much more. She was a known quantity: predictable, vain and ruthless, and with an insatiable desire for cash to enrich her family, friends, and political machine. Blindly ambitious to become president of the world s only superpower and swearing to come back after losing in 2008 to Barack Obama, she was the 21st century KGB s perfect mark.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Oct 21, 2017"
 Republicans Just Moved To Repeal Obamacare. They Never Expected Americans To Respond Like THIS (TWEETS),"President Barack Obama accomplished many great things in his 8 years as President of the United States, and he undoubtedly took America to heights greater than the mess he inherited when he first came into office.One of Obama s most notable presidential accomplishments was Obamacare, also know as the Affordable Care Act   an initiative that gave more Americans than ever access to affordable healthcare that they may not have been eligible for beforehand. Unfortunately, now that the GOP has taken back control of Congress with its disastrous President-elect Donald Trump, the Republican Party is making moves to undo all of Obama s hard work   starting with health care.Late on Wednesday night, the Senate made a disgustingly sneaky move toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, and shot down proposed amendments to protect Americans with preexisting conditions from discrimination and losing coverage.TwitterOn Thursday morning, Americans across the country woke up to a nightmare. Not only did they discover that the Senate was making fast moves to gut the Affordable Care Act, but many of them would be facing life or death consequences thanks to the Republican Party s agenda. As one woman said to Rep. Keith Ellison (D -MN) on Twitter, As a breast cancer survivor, this is a death sentence for me.  She was far from alone in that fear.Before Republicans knew it, people from across the country were using the hashtag #SaveTheACA to vent both their despair and desperation. Many of them are fully aware that once the ACA is taken away, they will die   and the GOP will be to blame.The GOP never banked on this kind of backlash   and here s what many Americans had to say:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterCurrently, the GOP has no reasonable plan to replace health care   and innocent Americans will be the ones to suffer.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"January 12, 2017"
 LA Father Kills Son For Being Gay (VIDEO),"Less than two weeks before his father used a shotgun to end his life, Amir Issa posted a heartbreaking cry for help to his Facebook wall.On March 19, 2016, the 29-year-old resident of Los Angeles wrote that he felt as if his mother, father and other family members were controlling his every waking moment.He also wrote:I was earning over $100k by age 26 and this has negatively impacted my life, made me live in pain and become unemployed. If there is a devil or evil spirit, I truly believe it manifests itself in my family.Later in the same post, he wrote:They have literally robbed my bank account, lied to courts and doctor, to try and label me as mentally ill, and failed in their attempts to have me falsely imprisoned and evicted. If there are any good people on this earth, please help free me from this inhumane slavery.Just ten days later, on March 29, his father murdered him and his mother. Issa s body was found outside the family home. According to police, he was gunned down with a shotgun.His mother s body was found in the bathroom. She died of multiple stab wounds.The L.A. County District Attorney s office called the shooting a hate crime. According to New York Daily News Issa s father had previously threatened to kill him for being gay.A video posted to his Facebook wall shows his father calling him a pervert and saying that he should be castrated.Shehada Khalil Issa is being held in the Los Angeles County jail on a $2,000,000 bond.This tragedy should have never happened.The death of Amir Issa is a heartbreaking reminder of the silent suffering of LGBT men, women and youth.Posts on his Facebook page indicate the family were members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church.On its website, the church states its official position regarding LGBT citizens, saying: The Bible makes no accommodation for homosexual activity or relationships.  Sexual acts outside the circle of a heterosexual marriage are forbidden For these reasons Seventh-day Adventists are opposed to homosexual practices and relationships. Amir Issa wrote on Facebook,  I want to open my eyes lord. I want to see Jesus.  He went on to say he  would like to have a family that attends church regularly,  but one that  doesn t punish my thoughts or actions if I am a good person which I know I am. From his posts, it appears that Amir Issa was murdered by his own father at least in part because of  these fanatical religious beliefs.Although he sent out a cry for help just ten days before he died, like those of so many other members of the LGBT community, his call for help went unanswered.Too often members of the LGBT community are isolated and alone. The isolation makes them more vulnerable to violence and exploitation, often perpetrated by physically, emotionally and mentally abusive family members.Things might have turned out much differently for Amir Issa if only someone had reached out to him ten days before, when he wrote the words: If there are any good people on this earth, please help free me from this inhumane slavery. It s too late now, for good people to reach out to Amir Issa.But it s not too late to reach out to someone else in the LGBT community.It s definitely not too late for our society to demand inclusion, knowing that exclusion leaves people isolated and vulnerable, making them easy targets for violence and abuse.As republicans across the country attempt to pass laws excluding LGBT people from society, it is up to the  good people on this earth  to stand up and say no.Here s more on this story from the New York Daily News.

“WHITE STUDENT UNION” Groups Spring Up World-Wide With A Message Obama And Friends Would Rather You Didn’t Hear," Individual people can be bullied into submission but as a group we can t be silenced If we are to really live in an environment where race is not a factor, we need to stop allowing the union of Obama-Holder-Sharpton-Soros-#BlackLivesMatter terrorists-Black Panther-Louis Farahkan-Black Liberation Theology-CAIR-liberal academia-Socialist Party-Democrat Party-Anarchists-Communist Party to stop making it an issue. White students are not a minority, but they are currently being treated worse than most minorities, if they break rank with the left-wing multicultural orthodoxy that is hellbent of persecuting expression of whiteness. White student unions are springing up at universities across Australia, as well as at universities and colleges across America.More than 30  White Student Union  pages have recently sprung up over the last several days on Facebook, pages that affiliate themselves with various universities around the nation.The creation of an  Illini White Student Union  Facebook page that surfaced Nov. 18 in response to a  Black Student Solidarity Rally  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign gained national attention, but apparently it s just the tip of the iceberg.Over the last week, at least 33 other  White Student Union  pages have appeared on Facebook, according to research conducted Sunday by The College Fix.Notably,  White Student Union  Facebook pages have been created for Stanford, Penn State, UCLA, UC Berkeley, the University of Missouri, and NYU, along with many others.These  White Student Union  pages currently exist only as social media creations, and it is not clear whether they are created by students at their respective universities. It is also unclear if these groups plan to become actual student organizations on campus, although a North Carolina university page states they plan on holding  group meetings, info sessions, rallies, and protests on the UNC campus. White Student Unions say they are supporting and defending the interests of white students who they say are becoming marginalised from on-campus life and political debate.This video truly exposes the hypocrisy of the Left. From the Illinois  White Student Union  Facebook Page:At least seven unofficial unions have formed at rapid speed in the past week, claiming to represent students of European descent at the University of Queensland, the University of Southern Queensland, the University of Technology, Sydney, Macquarie University, Western Sydney University, the University of NSW and the University of Western Australia.However, there are allegations that the movement is in fact an elaborate attempt to troll universities and the media, by the likes users of online bulletin boards 4chan and 8chan.If it is a hoax, it is a pretty sophisticated one, with members reaching out to news.com.au to share their views on the need to  advance our interests as white students .The proliferation of white student unions follows a similar trend in the US, where groups have built considerable support on social media and many intend to establish an on-campus presence in the new year. However, this has also been dismissed as a hoax.Australian universities have distanced themselves from these unofficial groups, which are copping backlash on social media by fellow students and others who accuse them of white supremacy and racism. Responses to the groups on social media have ranged from  be proud of your heritage!  to  f*** off Nazis .Others have responded with utter incredulity:  This page is satire, right?  one person asked.But the students behind the unions deny white pride is akin to racism, and argue they have as legitimate a place in university life as any other student group. ALL WE WANT IS EQUALITY The White Students Union at the Western Sydney University, which formed over the weekend and is already  into the double digits  of members, is  not out to antagonise anyone , according its spokesman.The spokesman, who approached news.com.au to write a story, said he was a 24-year-old journalism student and gave us his name, but we have chosen not to publish it because we could not verify it.He said the group, which will seek formal registration with the university in 2016 and already has a six-person committee, was designed to  advance our interests as white students and promote a safe space where we can come together as a community and organise . We re a genuine group, we re not doing it to troll anyone,  he told news.com.au. If you roll up to any university these days you ll have gay safe spaces, Muslim safe spaces: in the last four or five years it s become very politically correct. That s great. I m as PC as they come. We re staying within the narrative. All we want is equality. He said he was  absolutely  expecting a backlash, but wanted to  test the boundaries of what they re willing to acknowledge . We just thought, why not? Everyone else is doing it, why can t we do it? Anecdotally we have a lot of support from the ethnic students,  he said. Our main antagonists are actually the older, white academics. These people say they re all about equality. The academics try to build this narrative that nobody supports this stuff, but it s happening. We re just using that language ourselves. Despite the hoax claims, universities are taking the rise of these unions seriously.In a statement, a spokesman for Western Sydney University said the group was not an official or authorised student group, adding:  The university prides itself on the diversity of its university community and condemns any action that seeks to undermine this. Has there been a SINGLE college or university who has made this sort of claim about a Black Lives Matter organization or protest? Why the double standard? The University of Technology, Sydney, and Macquarie University both said white student unions formed by their students were not official and did not reflect the views of the universities or the majority of their students.In the  About  section of the Facebook page for the UTS White Student Union, it says the group was  advancing the rights for the people of European descent  and  anyone from any background can join .A spokeswoman for Macquarie University said it had publicly contacted the administrators of the page yesterday, requesting that they remove the campus image and refrain from referring to themselves as  a student organisation at Macquarie University .  We understand this page is likely to be part of a wider hoax, stemming from North America, nevertheless we are continuing our investigations into the origin of this page,  the spokeswoman told news.com.au.The University of Queensland went so far as to condemn the University of Queensland White Student Union, which was formed last Tuesday, as a  racist web hoax .On its Facebook page, which has 378 likes, the University of Queensland White Student Union group rails against university overcrowding and  rich international students  outbidding white Australian students for rental housing and casual work. We re forced to put up with an overcrowded campus that hosts thousands more students than it was ever designed for. Not enough parking, not enough toilets, not enough computers, not enough study spaces,  a post dated November 24 reads. We re forced to do group work with internationals who can t speak English, we carry the load and do all the work while our marks are dragged down. We re forced to put up with the anti-social behaviour of a particular group of students who treat study spaces as social spaces and constantly attempt to  reserve  public resources such as computers. Enough is enough. The founders of the UQ group asked not to be identified but said they represented white students  who ve had their voices silenced by political correctness . Individual people can be bullied into submission but as a group we can t be silenced,  the group told news.com.au Political correctness and free speech are issues that are becoming more and more important. The group said existing student organisations were  obsessed with catering to minorities  and they planned to establish their own society on campus in 2016. We re very clear on our position that white people have every right to organise themselves and act collectively to further their mutual interests,  they said. We don t think whites are inherently  superior  and definitely don t think they should  rule over  anybody else. We think the ideas and issues we re raising have become more relevant to students as a new strain of political correctness has swept across the Western word over the past few years promoting ideas like  white privilege . There are all these nasty ideas around now that white people, particularly white men, are always  privileged  regardless of their background and personal circumstances and that if they suffer hardship they deserve it, and that white people are the cause of everything that s wrong in the world. News.com.au asked the spokesman to prove that he was a legitimate student at the university, but he said he thought it was in his best interests to  maintain anonymity  due to death threats the group had received.Third-year University of Western Australia student Michael (who did not wish to reveal his last name) said he founded the UWA White Student Association on the weekend.He said ensuring all students and staff spoke fluent English, making sure  the full breadth of white, European holidays and festivities  were celebrated on campus, getting racist attacks on white students recognised as racism, and having the recently dumped European studies major reinstated were among the issues his group intended to lobby for. Our basic aims are to represent the interests of white students on campus, as well as do our bit to reverse what we view as the rapid decline of Western civilisation, caused by mass immigration resulting in a clash of values, and the decline of family values,  Michael told news.com.au.A spokesman for UWA said the university did not endorse  behaviours and actions which are deemed to be racially and culturally intolerant or offensive . UWA has a strong track record on promoting cultural and religious diversity and the university is committed to produce graduates who are intellectually and emotionally comfortable with difference,  the spokesman said. In response to accusations of racism, Michael says he and the group were not racists and  we never will be . Supporting white students doesn t imply hatred of other races, it s not a logical accusation,  he said. We would be happy to work with other ethnic clubs to fulfil mutual goals. (Groups that represent ethnic minority groups) are nothing new, and we don t have an issue with them. What is new is the increasing difficulty white students face in expressing their views, identity, or culture on campus without being shouted down and labelled. White students are not a minority, but they are currently being treated worse than most minorities, if they break rank with the left-wing multicultural orthodoxy that is hellbent of persecuting expression of whiteness. The emergence of white student unions at universities in the US, including Berkeley and Harvard, have been suggested to be a response to a wave of recent anti-racism protests. One such union at the University of Illinois sprung up hours after a black solidarity event was held on campus. Others, however, have been revealed as hoaxes. So where we may have a scholarship program for indigenous students, or we may have programs that seek to enhance the experience of international students on campus, and that s perceived at discrimination, it s very disappointing when people take that position. Dr Gale said it was also disappointing some people who were part of mainstream Australia didn t  have an appreciation for the privileged position  of being at university.For entire story: News com.au",politics,"Dec 1, 2015"
“WANNABE PRESIDENT” BARACK OBAMA MEETS With South Korean President After Trashing President Trump In Indonesia,"Former President Barack Obama seems to be feeling nostalgic for his old job, meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in Monday for 40 minutes.The Korea Herald reported that Moon spoke about his recent meetings with President Trump in Washington and asked Obama for his advice on how to improve that relationship.The meeting came after Obama spoke at the Asian Leadership Conference and the Fourth Congress of Indonesian Diaspora in Jakarta. There he attacked Trump s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord. In Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history about climate change, an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership can still give our children a fighting chance,  Obama said in Indonesia.The former president had said before leaving office that he appreciated his predecessor George W. Bush s silence during his tenure, but also contended that he s  still a citizen and that carries with it duties and obligations.    Daily Caller",politics,"Jul 3, 2017"
THE FRENCH FLEUR DE LIS OF NEW ORLEANS JOINS THE LIST OF “RACIST” SYMBOLS,"Wow! The list just keeps getting longer and longer! We can all find something to be offended by but should we ban all those things? I doubt anyone really gives any consideration to the history of the flour de lis as it is used in many different ways. Our history is just that so let it be and move forward already!The fleur de lis, a French symbol used by royal families dating back to the 13th century, and emblazoned on the New Orleans Saints helmet, is now being called a symbol of slavery, drawing comparisons to the recent uproar against the Confederate battle flag. As an African I find it painful, and I think people whose ancestors were enslaved here may feel it even harder than I do as an African,  said slave historian Dr. Ibrahima Seck to WWLTV.He connects the usage of the fleur de lis, to  code noir,  or black code, which was adopted in Louisiana in 1724, and used to govern the state s slave population.Seck said a slave caught running away,  would be taken before a court and the sentence would be being branded on one shoulder and with the fleur de lis, and then they would crop their ears. Seck isn t alone. Tulane history professor Terence Fitzmorris said,  It was a brutal way of scarring someone and also identifying someone as a particular troublemaker. The symbol is also used currently in the coat of arms for the King of Spain. Via: The Daily Caller",politics,"Jul 12, 2015"
SYRIAN DROPS TRUTH BOMB: Germany Asked “Refugees” [On Internet] To Come…”None of us had to flee…we didn’t want to go to the army…easier to get a good job and earn money in Europe”,"This is what happens when you have government leaders who represent their own self interests, putting job opportunities and national security for its citizens dead last. Sound familiar?A well-known Iranian born writer, Ramin Peymani explains in a Huffington Post- Germany article,  Der Syrer   eine Fl chtlingsgeschichte  ( The Syrians, A Refugee Story ), that, while living in Germany, he met up with the Syrian refugee in the checkout line at a local grocery store.Being Iranian, Peymani could speak fluently with the  refugee,  who freely admitted that he, and all the others claiming to be refugees, were not fleeing war, but had merely come in search of jobs and money.The Syrian told Peymani that his mother lived in America, that that his sister was still in Syria. Did you escape with your mother? Why your sister has not come?  Peymani asked. No, I did not flee. None of us had to flee,  the Syrian freely admitted. The Assad regime is cruel and unjust, but you can live in Syria, if you just don t mess with it. Peymani then asked if the Syrian had then fled from the Islamic State terrorists. The Syrian s answer in this regard was revealing as well: I come from Damascus, like most of us [refugees] do that I ve met in the camp. There is no IS [in Damascus]; it is in other regions, for example, towards Iraq. Peymani then asked him the logical next question:  Are you saying that most Syrians do not flee from war and persecution? The Syrian answered:  Yes. My friends and I went because we didn t want to go to the army. And because it is easier to get a good job and earn money in Europe. Peymani then wanted to know why so many Syrians had come so suddenly.  Why now are so many coming? Is it because the Assad regime has become worse? The Syrian replied:  No. He [Assad] has been in power many years already. The regime is cruel and can kill opponents, but my family and I have not been touched, and none of my friends either. So why had they all now come to Europe, Peymani asked, to which the Syrian replied: In the summer we saw on the Internet that Germany wanted people to live there. We were invited to come here. And it was said that the state would take care of us and we would be given jobs. But I cannot find one Peymani also asked him what route he had followed to Germany. I lived in Turkey for some time after my mother had emigrated to the United States to be with relatives. But I could not get a visa for the USA, even though my mother has a green card. Peymani asked him if he had  fled  to Turkey  because of the war in Syria? Laughing, the Syrian replied:  No (laughs). My friends and I are here because we thought we d find work. We did not like Turkey. He was then asked if his  story is typical of the people who leave Syria? The Syrian replied:  I think most go for the same reason as I did. All men of my age, who want to just live better elsewhere. ",politics,"Dec 29, 2015"
"COLLEGE That Receives $280 Million In State, Federal Funds Offers “African American Resistance in the Era of Donald Trump” Class [VIDEO]","OSU will receive more than $212 million in federal funding in 2016, they ll receive and additional $68 million in state funds.This winter, students at Oregon State University will have the opportunity to take a new class that promises to teach them about how African Americans have historically resisted the  white supremacy. The class, titled  African American Resistance in the Era of Donald Trump,  will be taught by Dr. Dwaine Plaza, a professor of sociology and current Chair of the Sociology Program in the School of Public Policy.Plaza announced the new class last week in an email sent to some Oregon State students and obtained by Campus Reform, explaining that  The goal of the course is to give students an understanding for how racism is deeply embedded in social media, movies, television shows, music, art, literature, and sports. In a statement to Campus Reform, Plaza asserted that  the class emerged after the November 8 election,  because  In my opinion we are about to step back into the 1960s when whiteness was currency and people of color needed to be in the shadows struggling for whatever trickles down to us. According to a copy of the syllabus obtained by Campus Reform, the course will teach students about the  evolution of modern racism  from the post-emancipation period up to the election of Donald Trump.Students will also learn about topics such as The Black Panther Party, The Harlem Renaissance, and Racism in Oregon.The class will be held from January 9 through March 17, according to the Oregon State course catalogue, and up to 20 students will be able to take the course, 17 of whom are already enrolled. Two other professors, Larry Rodgers and Marilyn Stewart, will also help teach the course.  Campus ReformOregon is a hot-bed for radical Trump haters. It was one of only a handful of states Hillary won with only 50% of the vote to Trump s 39.3%. On April 9, 2016 anti-Trump terrorists took over a Portland State University pro-Trump student meeting. There is so much irony in people who behave like common thugs and terrorists carrying signs saying,  Love Trumps hate,  while screaming down and threatening anyone with opposing views.

"American Scientists Harvesting Human Organs in Live Pigs, Creating a Human-Pig Embryo","21st Century Wire says This is one step closer to the future industry of farming organs in human surrogates.American scientists are now trying to grow human organs inside of pigs in order to  tackle the donor shortage  (problem, reaction, solution).The potential for limitless profits here is immense  The GuardianScientists trying to grow human organs inside pigs in an attempt to tackle a shortage of donors have successfully created part-human, part-pig embryos, it has been reported.Researchers at the University of California, Davis combined human stem cells and pig DNA and allowed the embryos to mature for 28 days, before terminating the experiment and analysing the tissue.They believe that the animals, which would have a human internal organ, may look and behave like any other pig and could be a ready source of organs for life-saving transplants.It was reported earlier this year that scientists had begun attempts to create the embryos but there has been opposition from authorities. In September last year, the US National Institutes of Health said it would not back research into so-called chimeras until it knew more about the implications.It cited fears that the presence of human cells could affect the animal s brain and behaviour, potentially making it more human. Prof Pablo Ross, the reproductive biologist leading the research, sought to calm those fears, saying that there was a  very low potential for a human brain to grow .Peter Stevenson, from Compassion in World Farming, told the BBC s Panorama programme:  I m nervous about opening up a new source of animal suffering. Let s first get many more people to donate organs. If there is still a shortage after that, we can consider using pigs, but on the basis that we eat less meat so that there is no overall increase in the number of pigs being used for human purposes. But Prof Ross said:  Our hope is that this pig embryo will develop normally but the pancreas will be made almost exclusively out of human cells and could be compatible with a patient for transplantation.

I am being advised by security that we are going to have to take a break,  Pai calmly told the audience. Soon after, a security guard could be heard loudly advising everyone in the room   both the Commissioners and the public visitors   to exit and leave their belongings in the federal agency chambers.Foundation that there was a specific bomb threat. Another senior official in the room said someone called into the office and said a briefcase was set to explode.The Commissioners and the audience were eventually allowed back in after Federal Protective Services surveilled the area and situation.A bomb threat occurring right during the middle of Pai s testimony is not surprising as public intrigue around the issue of net neutrality has become so intense that many incensed people have resorted to vile, racist actions.  Daily CallerIs This The New  Normal  For The Left When They Don t Get Their Way?Repeal supporters claimed the rules unnecessarily regulated the industry and impeded upon the free market.Under the rules rescinded Thursday, internet service providers were prohibited from influencing loading speeds for specific websites or apps. The vote rolled back the policies that treated the internet like a utility and could potentially lead to the creation of different lanes of speeds for websites or content creators willing to pay for them. Critics worry that those costs could be passed along to consumers.Internet service providers will have to disclose whether they engage in certain types of conduct, such as blocking and prioritization, following Thursday s decision. They must further explicitly publicize what is throttled and what is blocked, with the information posted on an easily accessible website hosted by the company or the FCC.Repeal is a hallmark victory for the FCC s Republican chairman Ajit Pai whose 11-month tenure has seen him strongly advocate for reduced regulation. Pai was named FCC chairman in January by President Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his interest in reigning in Obama-era business regulations.In July 2017, net neutrality supporters organized a  Day of Action  in support of net neutrality regulations; large tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon all showcased their support for the regulations.Net neutrality is the notion that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shouldn t be able to  slow down, speed up, or block data as it is routed from its content originator to end users  in order to favor particular sites. The net neutrality regulations put in place under the Obama administration involved subjecting the Internet to Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, where it s considered a public utility that is subject to the iron grip of the FCC.The FCC is now trying to kill these regulations, and they are right do so. Here are seven reasons why.1. The instances of ISPs slowing down or blocking data to favor certain sites over others are few and far between.2. Under Title II, the Internet is subject to a bevy of regulations at the whim of the FCC.3. The FCC can also subject ISPs to a slew of taxes under Title II.4. The FCC also has the power to prevent ISPs from charging websites at rates they deem to be unfair and ends  paid priority. 5. It s a form of censorship.6. It s crony capitalism in favor of web giants like Facebook and Google. That s why they support net neutrality, since it targets their competitors.7. The better way to ensure net neutrality is to breathe more capitalism into the ISP market rather than government control.",politics,"Dec 14, 2017"
 A Greyhound Driver Kicked A Black Woman Off The Bus For Refusing To Move To The Back,"On December 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks bravely defied a bus driver s orders to give her seat to a white person and move to the back of the bus. Parks  refusal is remembered as one of the greatest moments in civil rights history and, unfortunately, history has a way of repeating itself. Now, a California lawsuit has many comparing a San Fransisco woman to Rosa Parks   with very good reason.Toni Young was traveling via Greyhound to a family celebration in Sacramento. The African-American woman sat at the front of a bus driven by Caucasian lady Cynthia Lara. The driver explained to Young that she was expecting an elderly woman to board once they reached Sacramento   Young s destination   and that she would need to move to the back of the bus.Young explained that she would be getting off the bus in Sacramento, and that the seat would be available when it was needed. This was not good enough for Lara, however, and she insisted that Young move, complaining that the woman was far too uppity. Young  quietly  complied, but her attorney, Michael Adams, explains: My client quietly said to her,  You don t have to have an attitude about this . Lara then   loudly asserted that she did not have any attitude  and called for security to remove Young from the bus in Oakland. At that point, Young says Lara  loudly muttered  a racial slur. It was shocking to me that we have an incident like this reminiscent of the Rosa Parks incident many years ago,  Adams says. Young then had to wait several hours for another bus. While she awaited her new transportation, she asked for paperwork to file a complaint, but was told Greyhound was out of the forms. She requested to speak to a manager, but was informed none were available.Young eventually reached Sacramento, but the family celebration had ended by the time she arrived. It was the most dehumanizing incident of my life,  explained Young.  I will never ride a Greyhound bus again. Young says she suffers from psychological trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. She is seeking punitive damages from the company. It was shocking to me that we have an incident like this reminiscent of the Rosa Parks incident many years ago,  Adams says, pointing to an incident last year when a group of African-American women were kicked off a Napa Valley Wine Train for  laughing while black. Society seems to be backsliding,  he says.Sadly, he is right. After all, Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee.Featured image via Raw Story",News,"March 4, 2016"
MI SCHOOL SENDS Welcome Back Packet Warning Kids Against Wearing U.S. Flag To School,"ROSEVILLE, Mich.   Parents are raging after a Detroit area school district sent a packet to parents that lists the U.S. flag among items banned by the school dress code. A student s dress should not interfere with the learning environment,  Roseville Community School officials wrote.  The following are prohibited: The items include the typical slippers and sagging pants, spaghetti straps and bare midriff tops, but between  Hats or head gear  and  Low cut shirts,  the letter lists  U.S. Flag. Parents and others raged on Facebook Thursday. Here is a picture of the post by Facebook user and parent  Heather Marie :It didn t take long for school officials to clarify the  error. An informational packet was mailed out this week with an error,  according to a statement on the Roseville Community Schools website.  We apologize for the incorrect statement that was in reference to the US Flag. The statement that was published should have specified that the flag should not be worn in a demeaning manner.  EAG NewsHere s a screen shot of the  corrected  packet:The fact that Roseville Schools removed  U.S.  before the word  flag  from their corrected list of  Prohibited Apparel  is especially interesting. In fact, the words they replaced  U.S. flag  are so different, that many of the parents in Roseville think the school is just trying to cover their tracks.Here are a few of the comments under Heather Marie s post that got over 4K shares: After 1.8k plus shares, Fox 2 news, and channel 4 news the school has said that it was  a misprint  and they are able to wear the flag as long as it is not in a demeaning way. They said they took a short cut in printing the books, in all reality they were more than likely thinking no one was even going to read it. Anyways, I m happy that it has been fixed. Now I don t have to go and get all flag shirts and iron flags on the inside of them so they still show when they make them flip the shirt inside out for my 3 kiddos LMAO.   When letters get made and sent home before they make copies they proofread them several times. This is no accident they just realized that they have offended a lot of people and now want to try to fix their mistakes. You go mama bear! I agree parents should come together on that after all we are in the USA and it is our country I totally disagree with that . as a Roseville parent and a parent in the USA I proudly support the flag.

FED UP WITH #BlackLivesMatter Terrorists: Students At Major CA University Stage “White Solidarity” Walk Out," Join us as we walk out of our classes at 12:30 PM to show solidarity for our brothers and sisters of European descent  The Black Lives Matter movement at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is officially being challenged by a new rival campus group, the UCSB White Student Union (WSU).In response to a series of  black-out  demonstrations last week at UCSB and college campuses nationwide calling for  solidarity with Mizzou  black students, the UCSB WSU decided to form its own antithetical  White Student Walk Out  calling for  solidarity  with white students. Join us as we walk out of our classes at 12:30 PM to show solidarity for our brothers and sisters of European descent,  the Walk Out event description reads.  We will march out (preferably chanting something inspiring on the way out) and meet outside of the UCSB MultiCultural Center where we will respectfully voice our complaints. We ask that only self-identified white students and @llies join us. A growth of students have been supporting the satirical WSU movement, as evident by the exponential growth of WSU clubs on college campuses over the past couple of days. Students are demonstrating, using parody in the form of a white student club, how divisive the black separatist movement really is.Other WSU student groups such as the University of North Texas White Student Union and the University of North Texas White Squirrel Student Union, are adding their own political satire on social media to challenge the inflammatory response received by the WSU s while black separatist groups are celebrated.As these groups have illustrated, according to leftist  logic,  any form of gathering or club is  offensive  as long as it has anything to with white students and thus WSU groups have no right to exist and deserve condemnation in the form of university mass-mails or death threats.A student organizer of the UCSB WSU Walk Out event, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of risking his or her life, told The Daily Wire that he or she hopes the  walk out will give all of those who self-identify as white (and allies) to respectfully voice their complaints to UCSB administrators. Over the past couple days, it has become evident that white identities are actively marginalized and even openly attacked on campus,  the student said.  Because of this, it is crucial for us to create a safe space on campus where peoples of European descent can celebrate their European heritage. ",left-news,"Dec 1, 2015"

TRUMP WOULD FEED CHINESE PRESIDENT MCDONALD’S…Obama’s Treat Human Rights Violators To Over-the-Top State Dinner With Facebook Pal Mark Zuckerberg,"While Donald Trump says he d take the Chinese President to McDonald s, it s clear that the Obama s pulled out all the stops for the Chinese leader at the State Dinner last night. The night was heavy on the Silicon Valley and Hollywood moguls like Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps they were getting tips on how to employee more cheap labor.  PROM NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE!The striking difference in the attire of Mooch and the Chinese First Lady.  Did anyone else get the feeling it was Prom Night at the White House with the dress and hair Mooch was sporting?I know, I know, it s just that something s not quite right here maybe it s the hair and cleavage. Maybe Mooch is channeling her inner Beyonce. But that hair!President Barack Obama s lavish state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping was supposed to be the social release after a long day of business. The head table told a different tale   bulging with the top brass from Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Disney, DreamWorks and more.The 200-plus guest list for the Friday s soiree was a business-heavy mashup of Hollywood, diplomacy and corporate chieftains, with ballerina Misty Copeland s presence offering it a bit of a lilt.DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, part of the East Room s high-octane head table, was asked as he arrived whether the evening was all about business or pleasure. Fun,  he declared, but he added:  I hope. For more than a few guests, the dinner was a chance to build up some serious chits with Mom or other family members who arrived as dates.  Empire  creator Lee Daniels and R&B singer Ne-Yo, who was performing later in the night, both brought their mothers.Clara Daniels, glowing in a coral gown, declared her date  my No. 1 son    but didn t specify if that was because he s the oldest of her two sons or because he came up with the dinner invitation. I am the most proud mom,  enthused Harriett Loraine Burts, mom to Ne-Yo. Then Burts looked for a way to escape the cameras, confessing,  I m not good at this red carpet thing. As for how he scored the invitation to perform at such a high-powered event, Ne-Yo theorized it s because he s got some  Chinese in my heritage somewhere. First through the guest entry hall for dinner were former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and her dad. Faced with the fashion-forward question  What are you wearing?  Chao seemed momentarily stumped. Oh my gosh,  she stammered.  It s something very inexpensive. Copeland, who breezed through in a strapless metallic gown, had a similar response to the same query. I have no idea,  she confessed.There was no question about first lady Michelle Obama s fashion statement.She wore a black, off-the-shoulder mermaid gown created by Chinese-American designer Vera Wang.Xi s wife, Peng Liyuan, also a fashion-savvy first lady, selected an embellished silk gown in rich aquamarine.The  wow  factor was lower-key among seasoned state dinner attendees but still there nonetheless.Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she d been to  many  state dinners, but added,  They re always fabulous. Chris Dodd, the former senator and current chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, was asked if it ever gets old. Never,  he said.Ninety-two-year-old Henry Kissinger, the shrewd diplomat who served under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, hustled through without stopping to comment, moving pretty quickly even with a cane. The decor in the big East Room included a 16-foot silk scroll depicting two roses that the White House said was meant to symbolize  a complete meeting of the minds. That may have been somewhat aspirational, given the sharp differences between the U.S. and China on a range of issues.But all of that was largely glossed over in the dinner toasts. Obama said that while some differences were inevitable, he wished that the American and Chinese people may  work together like fingers on the same hand in friendship and in peace.  Xi, for his part, called the state visit an  unforgettable journey  and praised the good will he felt from West Coast to East.Asian influences were everywhere in the dinner plan, down to the Meyer lemons in the kurd lychee sorbet. (The citrus fruit is thought to have originated in China.)Guest chef Anita Lo, owner of Annisa in New York and a past  Top Chef  competitor, is a first-generation Chinese-American from Birmingham, Michigan. The culinary team created a menu that highlighted  American cuisine with nuances of Chinese flavor,  according to the White House. Guests dined on wild mushroom soup, poached Maine lobster, grilled cannon of Colorado lamb and poppyseed bread and butter pudding.Via: FOX NewsRead more: UK Daily Mail",politics,"Sep 26, 2015"
BREAKING: A Third Democrat Senator To Vote For Supreme Court Nominee Neil Gorsuch,"Assuming all Republicans support Gorsuch, the nominee would need the votes of five more Democrats to achieve the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster. If the number does not hit 60, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he will invoke the  nuclear option  to end filibusters of Supreme Court nominees and require only a majority vote for confirmation.Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Minchin, D-W.Va., announced Thursday they would vote to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: Senators have a constitutional obligation to advice and consent on a nominee to fill this Supreme Court vacancy and, simply put, we have a responsibility to do our jobs as elected officials,  Manchin said in a statement Thursday.  I will vote to confirm him to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csE04bREOAEHeitcamp of North Dakota also pledged her vote for Gorsuch and released a statement to confirm:  After doing my due diligence by meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing his record and testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I ve decided to vote in favor of his confirmation.

IT’S COME TO THIS: SWEDISH FAMILY KICKED OUT Of Home To Make Way For “Refugee” Invaders,"It s come to this legal citizens are being pushed aside for the  refugee  invaders. Sweden began to import refugees decades ago and now has a reputation for being a failed experiment in multiculturalism. Yes, Sweden is now the rape capital of the world. Say goodbye to Sweden A local family in the Swedish city of Liding  has been ordered by the government to leave their home so that it can be given to migrants arriving from a foreign country.Father of two teenage boys Uffe Rustan received a voicemail from his local municipality telling him he would need to vacate the property by August in order to make way for asylum seekers from the Middle East.  I was evicted from my home over the phone. When I asked for the reason, he said that people come from other countries. He left the news and basically just said have a nice weekend,  Rustan told a newspaper.Rustan lives with his teenage sons Rasmus (15) and Linus (17), all of whom were born in Liding . He rents the home from the city and has been living in it for less than a year.  It feels like I m worthless, even though I pay taxes and my kids go to school here. You cannot put a family on the streets for another family,  said Rustan.  Just when it starts to feel like home, we are evicted.  Rustan said that the news was  depressing  and wondered why native Swedes were being treated worse than migrants arriving in the country for the first time. Despite suffering from a housing shortage, Sweden is handing over property to economic migrants, with some politicians even encouraging citizens to give up their garages to asylum seekers. Sweden is not the only European government that is turfing its own citizens out of social housing to accommodate the influx of Muslim migrants. While migrants are in some cases enjoying all the comforts of good quality hotels, low income Germans are being ordered to leave their homes. As the Telegraph reported, Germans are beginning to receive notices of eviction to make way for asylum seekers.Read more: InfoWars",Government News,"May 31, 2016"
FBI DIRECTOR CONFIRMS Hillary’s Worst Nightmare Was Found On This Creep’s Laptop [VIDEO],"Be careful what you ask for Watch:  FBI Director James Comey testified Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Hillary Clinton emails containing classified information were forwarded to the computer of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman, by his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin.Comey also strongly defended himself on Capitol Hill for his Oct. 28 letter notifying Congress of newly discovered emails appearing pertinent to Clinton s private server investigation, arguing it would have been  catastrophic  to conceal such a revelation.He explained that his investigative team informed him in late October of metadata from Weiner s computer showing thousands of Clinton s emails on that device, including what they thought might be the  missing emails  from her first three months at the State Department.Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 over a sexting scandal and saw a 2013 mayoral run in New York City go up in flames for similar reasons. The investigation that led to Comey s letter concerned his sexting with an underage girl.  WFB",politics,"May 5, 2017"
 Lunatic Right-Winger Uses Girl Scout Cookies As Reason To End Laws Against Child Labor,"Right-wingers never have been very smart, but this one really takes the cake. There is an idea that the fact Girl Scout cookies are sold means America needs to end child labor laws. No, this isn t a joke and it isn t an exaggeration.A piece from The Federalist  is suggesting that children engaging in an annual fundraising drive by selling cookies are somehow no more offensive than 10-year-olds working in steel mills, or coal mines, for 10 or more hours per day, 7 days a week.To quote the article:The Girl Scout cookie program, in other words, teaches young girls how to be entrepreneurs; it teaches them how to work. It is, after a fashion, child labor. The great scandal is not that the Girl Scouts are promoting child labor, it s that there isn t more child labor in the United States today.Source: The FederalistThe author then complains about the fact the government has outlawed  every meaningful kind  of occupation for children younger than 14, Citing  any manufacturing occupation,   most processing occupations,   all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds or their substitutes,   outside window washing. Children younger than 14 should not have any meaningful kind of occupation other than school student! The sheer insanity of this is beyond words.He goes on to say that there is even a  strong case  for abolishing what he calls  compulsory education,  by letting them not go to school in exchange for being able to work full-time instead. I m sure a 10-year-old will land a good-paying full-time job where they can support themselves over the next 70 years with no schooling.The American right-wing has totally gone off the deep end. You might say  But this is only one writer s opinion.  The problem is, it isn t. Elected federal-level Republicans have resurrected the idea of removing safeguards against child labor just a few years ago. Even wannabe presidential candidates have advocated for it. It s a real thing that Republicans want to do, and that scares the hell out of me.If those freeloading Girl Scouts can safely sell harmless boxes of cookies for one month a year, why aren t they working the other 11 months in a steel mill instead of wasting time being  forced  to go to school. Right? God help us if these people take control.Featured image via wikicommons",News,"March 4, 2016"
DEAD BROKE HILLARY Buys Million Dollar “Mother/Daughter” Home For Chelsea…After Busted Giving Only 5.7% Of Clinton Foundation Money to Charity,"The 2014 IRS filings for the Clinton Foundation were recently released and the numbers were absolutely sickening. Out of $91.3 million spent in 2014, the organization s IRS filings show that only $5.2 million of that went to actual charity. That s because the candidate who says she represents the  everyday American  can t be bothered with helping the poor she needs to focus on providing a lifestyle for her and her lovely daughter Chelsea that only 1% of Americans can enjoy.  The Clinton s have mastered the art of getting rich in politics It s not quite the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, but Bill and Hillary Clinton are expanding their Westchester spread by buying the house next door, The Post has learned.The Clintons shelled out $1.16 million for the three-bedroom, 3,631-square-foot, ranch-style home set on 1.51 leafy acres on Old House Lane in Chappaqua.Westchester County land records and tax records from the town of New Castle   where Chappaqua is located   list William and Hillary Clinton as owners of the property.A source said the home could be used as a weekend retreat for their daughter, Chelsea, her hubby, Marc Mezvinsky, and their children, Charlotte and Aidan. Rumor has it that the Clintons plan to use this as a mother/daughter house for Chelsea and her kids to visit on the weekends when they want to escape the city and their Flatiron digs since the Chappaqua house has a nice pool and plenty of rolling green lawn for kids to play on,  the source said.

 U.S. Intelligence Says Details Of Russian Dossier Exposing Trump Are Checking Out (VIDEO),"When the bombshell dossier exposing Donald Trump s shady ties to Russia became public, it was easy to question the validity of the document. Although the golden shower accusation was the least important detail of the report, it certainly caught the attention of the public and was enough to make just about anyone say no way this can be legit. But according to CNN, U.S. intelligence agencies have been investigating the dossier and the document is gaining credibility because some of the details it contains are actually checking out.CNN reports:Law enforcement and U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing their investigation, but they say the corroboration of intercepted communications gives them a  greater confidence  in the dossier s validity.Naturally, Trump s team is already screaming  fake news    again. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told CNN,  We continue to be disgusted by CNN s fake news reporting.  He then called back to add this:This is more fake news. It is about time CNN focused on the success the President has had bringing back jobs, protecting the nation, and strengthening relationships with Japan and other nations. The President won the election because of his vision and message for the nation.Intelligence officials emphasized that the conversations they intercepted were between foreign nationals and came from routine information gathering. They also noted that some of the communications were from people who were known to be  heavily involved  in digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton to help Trump.U.S. intelligence agencies have still not come to any final conclusions regarding whether or not Russia really has any compromising information on Trump that they can use to blackmail him. They have also not confirmed any of the more  salacious  claims made in the dossier. In other words, they still don t know if Trump paid Russian prostitutes to  drain the swamp  for him.You see more on this here, via The Young Turks:.@CNN is reporting that an investigation into the  Pee-gate  dossier is gaining credibility. pic.twitter.com/j6CEHZJktN  The Young Turks (@TheYoungTurks) February 11, 2017Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 11, 2017"
 WATCH: Jake Tapper Teaches Trump The Difference Between Conspiracy Theories And Real News,"Donald Trump just got humiliated with facts again by CNN.On Wednesday morning, Trump once again attacked CNN by calling them  fake news  and accused them of pushing  conspiracy theories  in response to their reporting on the Michael Flynn scandal.The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017Flynn got caught lying about his discussion with Russian officials about the sanctions President Obama placed on Russia.Because Flynn was not a government official at the time, he violated the Logan Act. He also lied to Mike Pence about the discussion, and Pence proceeded to unknowingly lie in defense of Flynn and his activities.Thanks to White House staffers who leaked the truth, Trump was forced to accept Flynn s resignation.And Trump didn t like that so he lashed out at the media for reporting the leaks.Well, CNN host Jake Tapper BURIED Trump Wednesday afternoon by teaching him the difference between conspiracy theories and real news. The media, of course did not fire General Flynn, President Trump did,  Tapper pointed out. Now what the media did do was reveal to the nation that General Flynn had lied to the Trump team including Vice President Pence when he claimed he never discussed Obama s sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador. President Trump knew this at least as early as January 26th. But he did not act on this until media revealed the truth to you, and, as it turns out, Vice President Pence. Of course these stories are not conspiracy theories, these are news stories sourced by government officials,  Tapper continued.  Conspiracy theories are different, they re false, they re crackpot, they re nonsense. Tapper then proceeded to give Trump examples of conspiracy theories, such as when Trump claimed that Ted Cruz s dad helped kill John F. Kennedy or when Trump pushed the lie that President Obama was born in Kenya. THOSE are conspiracy theories,  Tapper declared.  These are facts. Ad if Trump weren t already humiliated enough, Tapper also slammed Trump s hypocrisy on leaks. Throughout Trump s campaign he cheered on Wikileaks and the FBI for leaking information he could use against Hillary Clinton. But now that the leaks are about him and his administration, he s pissed off about it. No president likes leaks, but it s worth noting candidate Trump s path to power was tread on a road of leaks. He didn t have a problem with leaks then. It s not a moral position if you only hold it when it applies to you. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump really needs to stop attacking the media.

Good News for Silver in 2017," James Burgess Oil PricePrecious metals are an important component of every investor s portfolio, and while gold often gets all the hype, another precious metal will be a much better bet in 2017: Silver.The market for silver continues to tighten as supply has failed to keep up with demand for much of the past decade. Silver is used in all facets of modern life, including electronics, medical devices, engines, batteries, solar panels, LED lighting, semiconductors, touch screens, dentistry, and nuclear reactors. The list goes on.Demand for silver is up by more than 35 percent since 2009, while supply only grew by a little more than 10 percent. In 2015 alone, global demand for silver exceeded supply by roughly 129 million ounces, or about 11 percent of overall demand. With silver consumption set to expand indefinitely, the supply deficit will continue to put upward pressure on prices in the years ahead.The set-up here is fantastic because indications are that we are on the edge of another bull run at a time when silver mining stocks are significantly undervalued. Silver prices had a good run for most of 2016, but have fallen back in recent weeks as the dollar has strengthened and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election abated. But the pause in the run up in prices will be brief, offering investors an appetizing entry point for a crucial commodity in today s globalized economy.Silver may be down 10% from its peak of $20.67 in Q3, but the sell-offs were based on sentiment, not fundamental reality and this is exactly where smart investment finds opportunity. The strongest documented indication of this is the Q3 earnings of silver miners, which only the savviest of investors are picking up on. Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) reported Q3 earnings of an impressive US$43.4 million up US$9.2 million over the previous quarter just for starters.[ ]1. The Global Silver Lining: A Precious Metal PremiumGlobal investors are magnetically drawn to precious metals in times of uncertainty and instability. Global tensions are as high as they were in the 9/11 aftermath, when precious metals soared phenomenally as everyone hedged bets against global instability Continue this article at Oil PriceREAD MORE FINANCIAL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Financial Files",Middle-east,"January 3, 2017"
" Republican: Porn Is Worse Than Cocaine, Gov’t Has To Act On ‘Public Health Crisis’","A Republican state senator in Utah believes that porn is such a threat to public health that he is proposing legislation to make the state take his aversion to skin flicks official. Whatever happened to limited government?Sen. Todd Weiler introduced his legislation on Friday, asking that the state recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard. He called for a reform to take on the  pornography epidemic that is harming the citizens of Utah and the nation. The politician told the Daily News that porn was more addictive than powerful drugs, and the public needed to start seeing adult films as a national epidemic. I have read books and I have experts tell me pornography is more difficult to overcome than cocaine,  he said.Weiler, 48, compares public attitudes on adult films in 2016 to early 20th century feelings about cigarettes, where doctors openly smoked and airplanes had smoking sections. He believes that his legislation will help to shift public opinion.The state senator made another strange comparison in an interview with a newspaper. Despite most Republican conservatives denying the existence of climate change, Weiler said denying the negative health effects of adult films was like denying climate science:  These are scientific facts, just like global warming. The legislator cited his experience as a divorce lawyer in providing him with an expert, insider point of view on the purported destruction that adult material can inflict on married couples.Weiler did draw a line in the sand for his proposed bill:  We re not going to outlaw masturbation in Utah. Even in a religiously conservative state like Utah, Weiler probably faces an uphill challenge in changing public attitudes. The state ranks as the #1 buyer of adult films in a 2009 survey, and a Harvard study showed that more than 5 out of every 1,000 households in Uitah paid for adult content online.

NOT KIDDING! HILLARY’S State Department Blocked Investigation Into Muslim Terrorist’s Florida Mosque Because “It Unfairly Targeted Muslims”,"Nothing to see here. Hillary was likely just fulfilling a promise to a foreign Muslim donor. It wasn t the first time she gave a  stand down  order and if the Democrat party can help it, it won t be the last Hillary Clinton s State Dept. shut down an investigation into the mosque Orlando killer Omar Mir Siddique Mateen attended because it  unfairly singled out Muslims. The Fort Pierce Islamic Center, where Mateen worshipped several times a week, was under investigation by both the FBI and DHS as early as 2011 for ties to a worldwide Islamic movement known as Tablighi Jamaal which was linked to several terrorist organizations.But the investigation was shut down under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHS s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims, according to recently retired DHS agent Philip Haney. The FBI had opened cases twice on him, and yet they found no evidence to charge him; it means they didn t go through the same basic, analytical process that I went through over a three- or four-hour period in which I was able to link the mosque to my previous cases,  he told WND on Sunday.In other words, the FBI had limited options at stopping Mateen because it was ordered to back off its investigation into his mosque.Both Clinton and the Obama administration have a history of enabling Islamic terrorism.In 2012, Clinton s State Dept. was backing al-Qaeda in Iraq, which morphed into ISIS, and other Islamic extremist groups as a proxy army to topple Syrian President Bashir al-Assad. The Salafist [sic], the Muslim Brotherhood and AQI [al-Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria,  a leaked memo between her State Dept. and the Pentagon stated.  The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support [this] opposition, while Russia, China and Iran  support the [Assad] regime. The FBI had opened cases twice on him, and yet they found no evidence to charge him; it means they didn t go through the same basic, analytical process that I went through over a three- or four-hour period in which I was able to link the mosque to my previous cases,  he told WND on Sunday. This secret document confirms that Clinton s State Dept.   and the Obama administration in general   were directly responsible for the rise of ISIS, which is now targeting the West. The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, confirmed the document s importance.  I don t know that [the Obama administration] turned a blind eye [to ISIS], I think it was a decision; I think it was a willful decision,  he said.Clinton even admitted some responsibility. The United States had   to be fair   we had helped create the problem we re now fighting,  she said in an interview with Fox anchor Greta Van Susteren.  When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, we had this brilliant idea we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force on Mujahideen, equip them with Stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.

OBAMA’S BROTHER Will Vote For Trump: “Deep Disappointment” In Barack’s Presidency…Wants To “Make America Great Again”,"The tsunami has started President Obama s Kenyan half-brother wants to make America great again   so he s voting for Donald Trump. I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,  Malik Obama told The Post from his home in the rural village of Kogelo.  Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him. Obama, 58, a longtime Democrat, said his  deep disappointment  in his brother Barack s administration has led him to recently switch allegiance to  the party of Lincoln. The last straw, he said, came earlier this month when FBI Director James Comey recommended not prosecuting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her use of a private e-mail servers while secretary of state. She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,  said Obama.He s also annoyed that Clinton and President Obama killed Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy, whom he called one of his best friends.Malik Obama dedicated his 2012 biography of his late father to Khadafy and others who were  making this world a better place. I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn t make things any better in Libya,  he said.  My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard. But what bothers him even more is the Democratic Party s support of same-sex marriage.Obama plans to trek back to the US to vote for Trump in November.

"BOOM! TED CRUZ Will Conduct Hearing TODAY: Focusing On Muslim Brotherhood, CAIR And Obama Regime’s Cover-ups, “WILLFUL BLINDNESS” To Radical Islam","Ted Cruz has no interest in playing  Mr Nice Guy  with Obama or his willing accomplices in the FBI, DHS or his DOJ It s been over a week since the largest terror attack on American soil in 15 years, yet nobody in Congress has successfully steered the discussion to the actual source of our perilous security situation. The Obama administration is covering up all connections of the Orlando shooter to known Islamic terrorists with the help of the Muslim Brotherhood advising DHS and the FBI. Yet, all Republicans and Democrats want to discuss is guns. That is about to change.On Tuesday, June 28, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, will conduct a hearing investigating the willful blindness on the part of the relevant law enforcement agencies to domestic Islamic terror networks. The subject of the hearing is  Willful Blindness: Consequences of Agency Efforts To Deemphasize Radical Islam in Combating Terrorism. Senators on the committee now have an opportunity to expose the Muslim Brotherhood influence within DHS and the FBI, their invidious  Countering Violent Extremism  Agenda, and their hand in covering up counter-terrorism investigations.Senator Cruz hinted at the agenda he plans to pursue at this hearing in an op-ed for Conservative Review earlier this week:President Obama s politically correct reluctance to attribute the terrorist threat we face with radical Islam hobbles our ability to combat it by discouraging counterterrorism agents from taking radical Islam into account when evaluating potential threats. The examples of Fort Hood, Boston, San Bernardino, and Orlando demonstrate the harmful consequences of this administration s willful blindness.Just yesterday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced at a press conference that the motives of the Orlando jihadist might never be known and that  our most effective response to terror is unity and love.  This comes on the heels of the government s attempt to redact any mention of Islamic rhetoric in the 911 call and DHS releasing another internal document scrubbing all references to Islamic terror. Just this week, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a front group for Hamas, was allowed to sit in on FBI interviews with members of the Fort Pierce mosque. The FBI was supposed to cut ties with CAIR, and DOJ was supposed to prosecute them in 2009 following the Holy Land Foundation trial, in which CAIR was implicated as a co-conspirator, yet they are granted full access to FBI counter-terrorism investigations. How can Republicans let this stand for one day? Worse, they are validating the Democrat premise by obsequiously holding vote after vote on the non sequitur of gun control while our own government is willfully allowing Islamic terrorist sympathizers to operate freely within DHS and sabotage all investigations that would have prevented these attacks.This hearing will likely focus on which figures within the federal government worked to squelch any research connecting the dots between local Muslim Brotherhood officials, these individual terrorists, and foreign terror networks. Senators on the committee now have an opportunity to expose the Muslim Brotherhood influence within DHS and the FBI, their invidious  Countering Violent Extremism  Agenda, and their hand in covering up counter-terrorism investigations. They can demonstrate how the federal government has hamstrung local law enforcement by refusing to cooperate and share information regarding jihadists living in their communities.Most importantly, this is the first opportunity to finally change the narrative from the false discussion about guns, which has nothing to do with Islamic Jihad. Hopefully, this committee hearing will be the beginning of a concerted effort for the legislative branch to actually engage in some critical oversight of the perfidious actions within the top echelons of federal law enforcement. The fact that GOP leaders in the House and Senate are not pushing multiple hearings and legislation dealing with this issue is scandalous, but unfortunately, not unexpected.

MAN ROBS TAXPAYERS OF $1.4 Million In Food Stamp Scam…Using Fish!,"Feldman operates Upstate Fish, a market at 826 Joseph Ave. His father, Jack, a Holocaust survivor, opened the store under the name Jack s Modern Fish Market in 1954 and is a well-known figure in the community. A year ago, the elder Feldman was among a number of Holocaust survivors who had Hanukkah dinner with the Obamas and the president of Israel at the White House.Irving Feldman was accused of two different schemes, one netting more than $1.2 million and the other more than $200,000.The more lucrative scheme involved unlawfully buying $1,227,063 worth of food stamps from willing recipients for less than half their face value, according to the news release. The recipients received cash, and Feldman was able to reap a considerable profit by redeeming the food stamps with the federal government for their full value. This fish market owner was caught running a food stamp fraud scheme that was truly breathtaking in scale,  state Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott said.Feldman also admitted to a second scheme in which he induced food stamp recipients to use their benefit cards to buy fish from other retail markets, then sell the fish to him at steeply discounted prices. The recipients pocketed cash, and Feldman got inventory he could sell at full value.The value of that scheme was about $202,000, the official statement said.Read more: DandC",left-news,"Dec 18, 2016"

Menstrual activism  is the latest effort by feminists to provide freebie tampons in the name of  MENSTRUAL EQUITY . Aren t there other things to focus on? CLINTON S TWEET IS IN RESPONSE TO THIS:New York City made history today with passage of the nation s first legislative package to ensure access to menstrual products in public schools, shelters and corrections facilities.In doing so, New York has stepped out as a leader in a growing national and global movement for menstrual equity. The city s new laws acknowledge that the ability to manage menstruation falls squarely at the intersection of sound health, economic and educational policy.The need to tackle this issue is not new. While menstruation has been a taboo and  off limits  topic since Adam and Eve, around the world there are legions of activists working to raise awareness of the devastating impact caused by lack of access to affordable, safe menstrual products.PICTURED BELOW IS A  ROUNDTABLE ON MENSTRUAL HEALTH BECAUSE SUPPOSEDLY AMERICA LAGS BEHIND IN  MENSTRUAL EQUITY America has long lagged behind, but that s beginning to change.

STUNNING: Hillary’s Own Numbers Show Her Tax Hike Proposals Will Cost American Workers Additional $1 TRILLION,"Wow! If I were Hillary, I d stop sending people to her website during the debates as a way to deflect from actual issues. They may find out something pretty horrifying like maybe a TRILLION dollar tax hike! Trillion dollar tax hike   Hillary s tax hike proposals will raise taxes on the American people by over $1,000,000,000,000 over the next ten years, based on her campaign s own numbers.Payroll Tax Hike   Hillary said she would not veto a payroll tax increase on all Americans should such a bill reach her desk. She said she would set her middle class tax pledge aside. This took place Jan. 12 in Iowa, and it s on video:Moderator:  Democrats have introduced a plan that Senator Sanders supports that you ve come out against because it is funded by a payroll tax. If that were to reach your desk as President, would you veto it in order to make good on your tax pledge? Hillary Clinton:  No. No. Soda Tax Hike   Hillary endorsed a steep new soda pop tax in Philadelphia. This will cost soda purchasers an extra $2.16 per 12-pack. Bernie Sanders called out Hillary s violation of her middle class tax pledge: Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal clearly violates her pledge,  he said.Sanders also said:  The mechanism here is fairly regressive. And that is, it will be increasing taxes on low-income and working people. 25% National Gun Tax   Hillary endorsed a new national 25% retail sales tax on guns.  I am all for that,  she told the Senate in 1993. On June 5, 2016 she was asked about her gun tax endorsement by George Stephanopoulos on ABC s This Week. She acknowledged her gun tax endorsement and did not disavow it, saying she wanted the gun tax money to pay for Hillarycare. If you have any doubts about her strong desire to impose a new gun tax, watch her face in the video.Doubling of federal excise tax on guns   Hillary also endorsed a doubling of the existing federal excise tax on guns.65% Death Tax   Hillary is now pushing a 65% Death Tax. And her own finances are arranged to shield herself from death taxes.Capital Gains Tax Hike   Hillary has proposed the most complex and Byzantine capital gains tax regime in American history, with ten different rates. She raises the top capital gains tax rate from 23.8% to 43.4%.No Corporate Income Tax Rate Relief for Anyone   Hillary offers no income tax rate reduction for any business. The USA has the highest corporate income tax in the world, which kills jobs and makes us less competitive. Even Bill Clinton understands the need to cut the corporate rate.No Personal Income Tax Rate Relief for Anyone   Hillary offers no income tax rate reduction for any American.Carbon Tax   Hillary s campaign has opened the door to a carbon tax if she wins the White House. Democrat Senate Leader Chuck Schumer is also fantasizing about a carbon tax under Hillary, and a carbon tax is part of the official 2016 Democrat party platform.To learn more about Hillary s tax hike plan, visit ATR s dedicated website: www.HighTaxHillary.com ",left-news,"Oct 9, 2016"
HEY HILLARY…WHO IS REALLY BEHIND Attempt By Party Of “DIVERSITY” To Use Bernie’s JEWISH Faith To Take Him Down… [VIDEO],"Is it possible the curtain has been pulled back, and the truth about the intolerant Democrat Party is out there for the whole world to see? Will DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz take the utlitmate hit to keep Bernie fans under control? When will the media expose Hillary s involvement in the DNC and media s coordinated take down of Bernie Sanders?Bernie Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said his team was  disappointed  by the emails from the Democratic National Committee leaked through WikiLeaks, which seemed to reveal staff in the party working to support Hillary Clinton. Someone does have to be held accountable,  Weaver said during an interview with ABC News.  We spent 48 hours of public attention worrying about who in the [Donald] Trump campaign was going to be held responsible for the fact that some lines of Mrs. Obama s speech were taken by Mrs. Trump. Someone in the DNC needs to be held at least as accountable as the Trump campaign. We have an electoral process. The DNC, by its charter, is required to be neutral among the candidates. Clearly it was not,  Weaver said, responding for the first time to the growing controversy.  We had obviously pointed that out in a number of instances prior to this, and these emails just bear that out. Another member of Sanders  staff, Rania Batrice put it this way:  Everything our fans have been saying   and they were beaten down for and called conspiracy theorists   and now it s in black and white. One of the newest leaks is an email thread about Sanders faith. Sanders, who is Jewish, did not bring up his religious faith much during the campaign trail and some DNC staffers were hoping he would. But the email itself does not mention Sanders by name, so readers are to infer that it may have been him. But it remains to be seen if these leaked emails are fakes.DNC CFO Brad Marshall sent an email, with the blunt subject line  No Sh*t,  to DNC communications director Luis Miranda, CEO Amy Dacey, and deputy communications director Mark Paustenbach, discussing if Sanders would be bringing up his faith during the Kentucky and West Virginia primaries: It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist. Dacey replied with a simple  Amen  about the topic. Sanders had discussed his Jewish heritage in the past, but has remained mum on all other religious aspects of his life. Marshall told The Intercept he did not recall writing this email and it wasn t necessarily geared toward Sanders.  Uproxx Via: Slate And InterceptThe email dump comes at a crucial time, just days before the party s national convention in Philadelphia, with thousands of delegates representing both campaigns gathering from across the country. Weaver and several other members of the Sanders staff have said they are worried the news could disrupt the goals of the convention.Weaver said the emails showed misconduct at the highest level of the staff within the party and that he believed there would be more emails leaked, which would  reinforce  that the party had  its fingers on the scale. Everybody is disappointed that much of what we felt was happening at the DNC was in fact happening, that you had in this case a clear example of the DNC taking sides and looking to place negative information into the political process.  ABC NewsDEMOCRATS WILL ATTEMPT TO  FIX  CRISIS BY DISALLOWING Blabbermouth Schutlz from speaking at the DNC but will that be enough?Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz will not speak at or preside over the party s convention this week, a decision reached by party officials Saturday after emails surfaced that raised questions about the committee s impartiality during the Democratic primary.The DNC Rules Committee on Saturday named Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source. She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed.

 Fox News Host Makes Herself A Total Laughingstock In Attempted Dig At NASA (TWEETS),"Fox News host Greta Van Susteren saw an opportunity to use NASA to take a jab at  big government  that is equal parts confused and stupid. It did not go well.NASA recently released some incredibly stunning photographs of Pluto, captured by the New Horizons spacecraft during its once in a lifetime flyby of the (dwarf) planet in 2015. The tiny spacecraft took close to ten years to arrive to Pluto and now heads out even deeper into what is called the Kuiper Belt, a collection of  ancient icy mini-worlds  at the far reaches of what we would consider our solar system.Only the technical feat and stunning photographs weren t good enough for Van Susteren. She was upset that NASA took so long, and seized the opportunity to rail against NASA using American tax dollars while not delivering its photos into Greta s inbox faster than the speed of light.Why did they wait until NOW to release these? pics taken in 2015 and we pay their salaries in tax dollars https://t.co/hhXxrfsWEr  Greta Van Susteren (@greta) June 1, 2016It s clear that Van Susteren didn t bother to read the article she linked to, or she may have found her answer. It wasn t a vast government cover-up to hide images of Pluto from the taxpayers. It was the fact that Pluto is really, really far away and the data takes a very long time to trickle in.Though the encounter took place more than 10 months ago, New Horizons is still beaming flyby data home, and likely won t be done doing so until this coming fall, mission team members have said.Van Susteren s goal seemed to be to slam the Obama administration for cutting NASA s budget, a critique that is both laughably off-base and not the issue. As one Twitter user patiently explained to Van Susteren, demanding a low power spacecraft to send high-resolution images back faster is like getting 9 women pregnant in the hopes of making a baby in a month. That s not how any of this works. (In any case, the New Horizons spacecraft launched in 2006, three years before Obama sent Fox News into a rage frenzy about  responsible  government.)There s no question that NASA has been hamstrung by its dwindling budget, but its financial woes have nothing to do with Obama. Republicans in Congress, eager to kill anything that even smells like it could support climate change, have repeatedly tried to dismantle the space agency s budget over allegations that the data it collects is biased against climate deniers. This death by attrition has meant the shuttering of the manned space shuttle program, as well as cutbacks in cutting-edge research. Instead, Republicans have told NASA to focus more on space   a vague directive if there ever was one   and not on Earth. And like any good hostage taker, to show they were serious, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology (a misnomer considering how anti-science the committee is) went ahead and slashed an additional $320 million.Van Susteren s network has, of course, acted as the Republican Party s cheerleader through all of this. Routinely, Fox News will feature thinly veiled hit pieces on science and research in order to  prove  that spending government money on such endeavors is a waste. Much better, they argue, to waste that money on fighting a losing legal battle for the right to discriminate against transgender children. Or on fighter jets that don t work.However at this rate, getting a person like Greta Van Susteren to see the hypocrisy in her jabs at NASA and Obama might take longer than a trip to Pluto and back.Featured image via Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016"
CLASSLESS HOLLYWOOD LIB ADDRESSES THOUSANDS AT COMMENCEMENT SPEECH…Drops “F-Bomb” In Whiny Opening Line,"Just another whiny radical leftist keeping it classy. Birds of a feather Robert De Niro delivered the commencement speech to graduates of NYU s Tisch School of the Arts on Friday, opening up his remarks with a blunt warning:  You re f***ed. The Oscar-winning actor grinned as he told the film, art, and media graduates at the Theater at Madison Square Garden that while those with degrees in law and business  used reason and logic and common sense to research a career,  the art school graduates would  have to keep working  to find steady employment. You discovered a talent, developed an ambition and recognized your passion,  De Niro said, according to the Associated Press.  When you feel that, you can t fight it. Just go with it. When it comes to the arts, passion should always trump common sense. You re an artist   yeah, you re f***ed,  the actor continued.  The good news is that s not a bad place to start. De Niro, who won an Academy Award for both 1975 s The Godfather: Part II and 1981 s Raging Bull, also offered up some tips on how to make it in Hollywood, according to the Hollywood Reporter. He warned the graduates about facing a  lifetime of rejection,  but said  you don t want to block the pain too much. Rejection might sting, but my feeling is that often, it has very little to do with you. When you re auditioning or pitching, the director or producer or investor may have someone different in mind, that s just how it is. That happened recently when I was auditioning for the role of Martin Luther King in Selma! Which was too bad because I could ve played the hell out of that part. I felt it was written for me! But the director had something different in mind, and she was right. It seems the director is always right.The Oscar-winner also told graduates to use the word  Next  to move from project to project. You didn t get that part? Next! You ll get the next one or the next one after that,  he said.  I know you re going to make it. Break a leg. Next! According to the New York Daily News, most of the graduates in attendance laughed off the actor s blunt advice. He was just being honest,  22-year-old graduate Jamie Jensen told the paper.  We were all just laughing. It s so true in a way   we all joke about it. You know it going in to art school. But Jensen s mother did not exactly approve of De Niro s colorful language. It was right at the beginning   first line,  Maria Jensen told the paper of the actor s many uses of expletives.  You don t really want to use the F-bomb in front of thousands of people. That s just my take. Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"May 24, 2015"
DID FOX NEWS’ MEGYN KELLY EXPOSE HERSELF AS JUST ANOTHER WHINY LIBERAL NEWS HOST?,"Thoughts on the first GOP Presidential Primary Debate by Patty of 100% FED Up!There are a lot of FOX News fans who have been clinging to FOX for their  fair and balanced  news like a beacon of light in a storm since 9-11. I know I found myself scratching my head over the behavior of Fox News hosts, Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier (I never expected Chris Wallace to be fair or balanced).I thought the most striking question of the night was directed at Scott Walker about his position on the defense of life. It s interesting that Megyn Kelly was so appalled by the Planned Parenthood video series on her show, yet gave the impression she was going to nail Walker with his defense of the unborn in cases of rape and incest. I watched her discuss this question with pundits following the debate and she actually acknowledged that Walker s response to her question could potentially sink his presidential aspirations. So tell us Megyn Are you in support of defending the unborn or just the unborn in case of a teen pregnancy? Where do you draw the line in your outrage? After watching her last night, I couldn t help but wonder if her outrage over the Planned Parenthood issue was genuine or simply staged for ratings. I also caught her smirking, as she attempted to hide her self satisfaction after one of the pundits suggested her comment about Donald Trump really hurt him with voters and specifically with Republicans.And finally I could barely contain my anger as Megyn played right into the hands of the Democrats and their false GOP  war on women  narrative. Did she actually believe she swayed woman voters with her  gotcha  remarks about Rosie O Donnell, who is the poster child for a progressive feminist social experiment gone bad? Is there another  celebrity  out there who is more open about her hate for America and for the values and ideals that have made us the greatest country on earth? As far as I m concerned, Donald Trump did America a favor when he shined the light on her belligerent, arrogant and intolerant attitude as a host of The View toward anyone who disagreed with her radical progressive views. Rosie asked for a fight, and the media gasped when Trump fought back! If America is looking for a candidate who is more concerned about how many people like him because he/she runs away at the first sign of controversy, then Trump, Cruz, Carson, Paul, Huckabee, Fiorina and Walker are likely not going to be on your list of top 3 candidates. (I didn t include Christie because I personally think he exposed himself as a fraud during Hurricane Sandy with his loving embrace of Obama when he needed it most.)Megyn was on a mission to make history last night. I don t think she really changed anything for Trump. Trump will wake up today and be as bombastic as he was before he set foot on his first presidential debate stage. He will call out anyone who dares to attempt to force him to adhere to their narrow view of what a GOP candidate should look like, and he will double down on Rosie or anyone else who tries to trash America. The only thing I believe Megyn did last night was show her adoring viewers that she really isn t the Megyn we all thought we knew.Can Megyn Kelly ever recover from her performance as a  fair and balanced  moderator at her first ever Presidential debate? After painting loudmouth, anti-American Rosie O Donell as a damsel in distress and Trump as an evil antagonist, will any sane conservative care what she has to say ever again?Here s the Rosie O Donnell video where she decides to mock Trump:Here s Trump s response to Rosie on the Letterman show:So after watching these videos, can someone explain why Megyn felt the need to defend Rosie from Donald Trump about a public argument between the two of them in 2006?

 Joe Biden Makes BIG News About 2020 Election,"The results of the disappointing 2016 presidential election aren t even official yet, but Vice President Joe Biden is already making noise about 2020. Known for bucking the rules and speaking from his gut, the outgoing vice-president hinted that he might be up for another fight four years from now.CNN asked him jokingly if he planned to run for office again. Yeah, I am. I m going to run in 2020,  Biden responded.When asked for what position, Biden responded,  For president. What the hell, man. When CNN told Biden it was planning to publish his quotes, the vice president responded,  That s okay. No, I ve enjoyed every minutes of my time here in the Senate. It s a great feeling to come back. I love this place. Biden later clarified,  I m not committing not to run. I m not committing to anything. I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening. Biden is leaving office one of the most popular political figures in America, and that popularity is even higher among Democrats. Biden is seen by many as a Democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum, but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a Senator from Delaware and then as a two-term Vice President.Biden would likely be able to tap into existing Democratic donors if he ran, as he has near 100% name recognition domestically and internationally. Besides First Lady Michelle Obama, he would probably be the public figure to benefit most from an association with President Obama.Biden considered running in the 2016 election, but decided against it after the tragic death of his son Beau Biden. Since then, President Obama has put Biden in charge of the  moon shot  effort to find a cure for cancer, while Biden endorsed and heavily campaigned for Secretary Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.Featured image via Flickr",News,"December 5, 2016"
 WATCH: Guiliani Claims Trump Gave Up Birtherism And Chris Matthews WRECKS Him,"MSNBC host asked one final question during an interview with Rudy Guiliani on Thursday and his answer caused Matthews to take the former mayor to the woodshed.For years, Donald Trump has been outright accusing President Obama of not being born in the United States. Then President Obama released his birth certificate to the public and thoroughly humiliated the businessman.And now that Trump is the Republican nominee, his birtherism is coming back to bit him in the ass as he has repeatedly been asked if he still believes President Obama was born in Kenya.So far, Trump has refused to talk about it and is hoping the media will just forget about the whole thing, but Chris Matthews had other ideas on Thursday as he cornered Rudy Guiliani about it.Matthews pointed out that Mike Pence and Ben Carson have both broken with Donald Trump to confirm that President Obama is the legitimately elected Commander-in-Chief of the United States.Guiliani claimed that he also believes that and said that Donald Trump believes that as well, but Matthews didn t buy it because Trump has avoided talking about it and has not publicly admitted that President Obama was born in America. When did he do that?  Matthews demanded to know.Guiliani claimed Trump said it a few years ago, but that was news to Matthews, who continued to grill Guiliani about it.Guiliani then tried to blame Hillary Clinton for the birther movement, but Matthews quickly shut that lie down and made Guiliani squirm. When is he gonna say that this president is legitimate?  Matthews repeated.  This is a fundamental question, mister mayor. Is the President of the United States legitimate of not? Guiliani continued to try and cover Trump s ass, but Matthews was not having any of it. Can you commit to your candidate saying in the next 24 hours that President Barack Obama s a legitimate president?  Matthews asked.  Can you commit for him that he will say that? But Guiliani couldn t even do that and ended up desperately trying to change the subject to Hillary Clinton.Here s the video via YouTube:Guiliani got his ass handed to him in this interview and that makes it very clear that Donald Trump needs to eat some crow and admit that President Obama is a legitimate president and reject birtherism once and for all.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 9, 2016"
AFTER GM’S TAXPAYER BAILOUT AND $10 BILLION IN FORGIVEN DEBT…Cars Now Made In China [Video],"Was the GM bailout REALLY about American jobs? The taxpayers were sold a bill of goods on the GM bailout and still haven t seen anything but jobs going overseas. The American worker and American taxpayer deserve better!In 2016, General Motors will roll out for the first time in the United States a new model of Buick built exclusively in China: the Buick Envision.It s the first time the iconic American auto manufacturer will sell cars built in China in the United States since receiving a sizable taxpayer-funded bailout at the end of the George W. Bush administration and beginning of the Barack Obama administration.The Buick Envision which was available in China for purchase as far back as 2014 will make its official debut in the United States in the summer of 2016.The Buick Envision bills itself  a luxury crossover designed to turn heads and welcome you in. A quick search of  Buick Envision  leads to the Buick Envision s website where one can explore all the features and design of the vehicle. The website doesn t appear to make any reference to the fact that the Envision is manufactured in China.The issue of U.S. auto manufacturers moving production facilities overseas has taken a center stage this presidential election, with the rise of both billionaire Donald Trump in the Republican Party and of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16% of Vermont in the Democratic Party.Trump has drawn attention to GM competitor Ford for the company s decision to move manufacturing to Mexico, but Ford wasn t the recipient of a taxpayer-funded bailout. Sanders, meanwhile, has used his opposition to the bailouts to show that he isn t influenced by crony capitalism all while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has tried to take credit for saving the auto industry with her support of the bailout.Breitbart News reached out to American Jobs Alliance to get its reaction to GM s decision to import Chinese-produced cars.  When the taxpayers bailed out General Motors, we were told it was all about saving jobs in America. Now GM turns around and throws Americans under the wheels of Buicks made in China. Where does it stop? Will General Motors build Cadillacs, Chevys and GMC trucks in China next?  Curtis Ellis executive director American Jobs Alliance told Breitbart News.General Motors has also announced plans to sell a Chinese manufactured hybrid Cadillac, the CT6 in American markets. Flint was known for decades as Buick City. It s now jobless, bankrupt and destitute,  Ellis continued.Read more: Breitbart",Government News,"Mar 31, 2016"

The expanded version of the case can be found here.Here is an important portion of that case: October: FISA request. The Obama administration submits a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence is found   but the wiretaps continue, ostensibly for national security reasons, Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes. The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services.January 2017: Buzzfeed/CNN dossier. Buzzfeed releases, and CNN reports, a supposed intelligence  dossier  compiled by a foreign former spy. It purports to show continuous contact between Russia and the Trump campaign, and says that the Russians have compromising information about Trump. None of the allegations can be verified and some are proven false. Several media outlets claim that they had been aware of the dossier for months and that it had been circulating in Washington.January: Obama expands NSA sharing. As Michael Walsh later notes, and as the New York Times reports, the outgoing Obama administration  expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government s 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections.  The new powers, and reduced protections, could make it easier for intelligence on private citizens to be circulated improperly or leaked.January: Times report. The New York Times reports, on the eve of Inauguration Day, that several agencies   the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Treasury Department are monitoring several associates of the Trump campaign suspected of Russian ties. Other news outlets also report the exisentence of  a multiagency working group to coordinate investigations across the government,  though it is unclear how they found out, since the investigations would have been secret and involved classified information.February: Mike Flynn scandal. Reports emerge that the FBI intercepted a conversation in 2016 between future National Security Adviser Michael Flynn   then a private citizen   and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The intercept supposedly was part of routine spying on the ambassador, not monitoring of the Trump campaign. The FBI transcripts reportedly show the two discussing Obama s newly-imposed sanctions on Russia, though Flynn earlier denied discussing them. Sally Yates, whom Trump would later fire as acting Attorney General for insubordination, is involved in the investigation. In the end, Flynn resigns over having misled Vice President Mike Pence (perhaps inadvertently) about the content of the conversation.February: Times claims extensive Russian contacts. The New York Times cites  four current and former American officials  in reporting that the Trump campaign had  repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials. The Trump campaign denies the claims   and the Times admits that there is  no evidence  of coordination between the campaign and the Russians. The White House and some congressional Republicans begin to raise questions about illegal intelligence leaks.March: the Washington Post targets Jeff Sessions. The Washington Post reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had contact twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign   once at a Heritage Foundation event and once at a meeting in Sessions s Senate office. The Post suggests that the two meetings contradict Sessions s testimony at his confirmation hearings that he had no contacts with the Russians, though in context (not presented by the Post) it was clear he meant in his capacity as a campaign surrogate, and that he was responding to claims in the  dossier  of ongoing contacts. The New York Times, in covering the story, adds that the Obama White House  rushed to preserve  intelligence related to alleged Russian links with the Trump campaign. By  preserve  it really means  disseminate : officials spread evidence throughout other government agencies  to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators  and perhaps the media as well.In summary: the Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorization to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the NSA rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media.Levin called the effort a  silent coup  by the Obama administration and demanded that it be investigated.In addition, Levin castigated Republicans in Congress for focusing their attention on Trump and Attorney General Sessions rather than Obama.  Breitbart NewsPresident Trump also used Twitter to build his case against the Democrats and how they are attempting to unfairly trash the reputation of Jeff Sessions,  an honest man :Jeff Sessions is an honest man.

" Trump Insists Stop And Frisk Wasn’t Ruled Unconstitutional – He’s Wrong, It Was (VIDEO)","The first presidential debate was Monday and let s just say that Donald Trump had a very bad night. One of the GOP candidate s easiest lies to expose was his insistence that  stop and frisk wasn t ruled unconstitutional. He s wrong, it absolutely was.Debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump about his recent arguments in favor of  stop and frisk  and mentioned that the court has declared the practice unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory. Stop and frisk  was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men    Trump cut Holt off mid-sentence: No, you re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. Factcheck: U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled  stop and frisk  to be unconstitutional August 12, 2013. According to the Center for Constitutional Rights, Judge Shira Scheindlin found the NYPD s practices to violate New Yorkers  Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and also found that the practices were racially discriminatory in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, The Bloomberg administration did appeal the ruling. The order was then suspended by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the case was sent back to be tried again with a new judge presiding over the proceedings. However, the court shot down the city s motion and decided not to vacate Scheindlin s decision. The appeal was eventually dropped by the de Blasio administration.Trump, who has run a bigoted campaign right from the start, was completely undeterred by Holt s assertion of the facts and continued to argue vehemently in favor of the discriminatory policing practice.Watch Trump wrongly argue that  stop and frisk  wasn t ruled unconstitutional, even though it was, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 27, 2016"
"LAWS ARE FOR THE COMMON MAN…NOT FOR BARRY SOETORO: Obama Gives Work Permits To 2,000 After Judge Ordered Him To Stop","It was all an  accident.  It s good to King The Obama administration continues to ignore the law and do pretty much whatever the hell it wants.From The Hill:The government  erroneously  doled out about 2,000 expanded immigrant work permit authorizations under President Obama s controversial executive actions, even after a federal judge blocked the move, the Justice Department says. The Government sincerely regrets these circumstances and is taking immediate steps to remedy these erroneous three-year terms,  the Department of Justice wrote in a court advisory filed late Thursday in the Southern District of Texas.The advisory comes after District Court Judge Andrew Hanen halted the implementation of the executive actions, which defer deportations for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and provide them with expanded access to work permits, until the courts could decide whether the policies are constitutional.While the old policies authorize a two-year renewal of work permits under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the new program would allow for a three-year renewal.The DOJ added in the advisory that the Department of Homeland Security is  converting  the three-year renewals into two-year terms and that DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has asked the agency s inspector general to investigate.Oh good they re investigating, I m sure they ll be fair and honest, right? If we can t trust them to follow a judge s ruling then why should we trust them about any immigration policy they might seek in the future? This is just pathetic. And of course it s released on Friday afternoon, knowing that the complicit moron media will barely report it.Via: The Right Scoop ",left-news,"May 12, 2015"
 REPORT: Even Republicans Are ‘Disturbed’ By Trump As Congress Looks For A Way To Oust Him,"Donald Trump s days in the White House could be numbered if Republicans stop denying reality.On Thursday, Trump delivered an insane press conference in which he spewed a string of lies and bragged about how many electoral votes he received.He repeatedly claimed that the media pushes  fake news  and openly praised conservative outlets like Fox News for kissing his ass.Overall, Trump demonstrated once again that he is totally unfit to hold the office he occupies and that is why lawmakers are actively pursuing ways to kick him out of the White House before he does something even crazier.Earlier this week, Rep. Earl Blumenauer called for a congressional review to explore the constitutional process to remove an unstable person from the presidency. It s not normal behavior,  Blumenauer said.  I don t know anybody in a position of responsibility that doesn t know if they re being rained on, and nobody I work with serially offers up verifiably false statements on an ongoing basis. And that s why Rep. Ted Lieu is going to introduce a bill to require a psychiatrist work at the White House.Because if Trump is mentally unfit to be president (He is.) then the American people have a right to know and he should be removed from office so he can t harm anyone else or this nation ever again. I am not a mental health professional, so I don t know in terms of any sort of medical expertise on this,  Lieu said in defense of the bill.  But I do see and hear the same things that other people see and hear, and a lot of people have concluded that what s going on is not normal. So what do I do with that as a member of Congress? Anyone who can launch 4,000 nuclear weapons in minutes absolutely should be questioned on any matter related to their physical and mental health. Exactly. Trump is so unstable and predictable that he could literally launch a nuclear strike any time over the smallest slight. The fact that random guests at the Mar-a-Lago parties can take pictures with the guy who carries the nuclear football is also worrying.Even Republicans think Trump s behavior is  disturbing  even if they do refuse to admit that he should be kicked out of office.Rep. Mike Simpson told The Hill that,  The behavior is somewhat disturbing,  but thinks  it s a stretch  to question Trump s mental and emotional stability.So the question is how much more proof do Republicans need before they admit that Trump is dangerous and needs to go? Because the fact that they are willing to defend him after all the insanity and chaos we have seen in the White House so far makes one wonder if they are mentally and emotionally stable enough to be congressmen.A Republican judge was brave enough to call for Trump s impeachment earlier this week. Republicans in Congress would be wise to listen to him.If President Obama had acted like Trump is acting they would have moved to impeach him on the first day. America has already put up with four weeks of Trump s bullshit and it s only getting scarier.It s time for Republicans to recognize the reality of the situation and do what s best for the country instead of what s best for the Republican Party. And that means Trump should be impeached immediately.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"February 17, 2017"
 Seth MacFarlane Wants His Fellow Bernie Supporters To Know Something VERY Important,"Very outspoken Bernie Sanders supporter Seth MacFarlane recently told the Jason Rantz Show a few things he d like to see out of he fellow Bernie supporters. The Family Guy creator knows that you can be fervent in your support for a candidate without losing sight of the bigger picture.He said: I actually am one of the people who has been a little disappointed at the way that, not necessarily the campaign, the supporters of the campaign have treated Hillary. I think she s been treated a little harshly by the left. Then making a comparison with those on the right side of the aisle, a party who s lost their damn mind in regards to Trump, a man who they are actually putting forward with all seriousness for president, MacFarlane said: That party has lost some control. This is a guy who is the result of a lot of bigotry gone wild. On the other hand, my side, the left, has gotten a little unreasonable when it comes to separating the trivial from the profound. He added later: The problem is if we don t pick our battles, then we look unreasonable. And I think that s part of where Trump has come from because we have not been able to separate things that are injustices from things that we re just offended by. And it s troubling. MacFarlane seems to know that every ounce of hate thrown at Hillary Clinton is an ounce of ammunition that may be used later. He also knows that when there s no clear distinction between arguments that are serious versus those that are petty and ridiculous, it only serves to hurt the candidate you re trying to support. In essence, many Bernie supporters are actually helping Trump, because they re validating that same sort of rhetoric that is being seen from his supporters as well.At the end of the day, we need to remember that a Democrat needs to win the White House in November. Whether that candidate is Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, we need to vote blue no matter who. It s our best shot at retaining sanity within the Oval Office.Featured Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images",News,"April 8, 2016"
 Conservative Terrorist Given INSANELY Light Sentence For Threat To Kill ‘Usurper’ Obama,"Last year, a Wisconsin man was busted for threats he made against President Obama s life. This wasn t just an instance of someone who has been brainwashed spouting off about lynching ( hanging for Treason ) the President. Brian Dennis Dutcher actually intended to kill the President, even if he had to use a slingshot. During a July 15 visit to Wisconsin, a threat lurked in the shadows. The usurper is here and if I get a chance I ll take him out and I ll take the shot,  Dutcher told a security guard at a La Crosse library as he prepared his attack against the President   something conservative media had convinced Dutcher was his Constitutional duty. Sure, he may have just been making small talk   Nice weather today. I m going to kill the President.   but Dutcher s Facebook posts leading up to the vocalization of his plot reveal that this is something he had been openly planning. I have been praying on going to D.C. for 3 months and now the upsurper is coming HERE. saving me a 800 mile trip,  wrote in a June 30 Facebook post.  Doing what I do for my daughter, so she can live free. pray for me to succeed in my mission.  Dutcher explained to his friends and family that it is his  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO TAKE ACTION  because  the gov has declaired war on us. Another post, which Dutcher had deleted explained his plan in more detail: that s it! Thursday I will be in La Crosse. Hopefully I will get a clear shot at the pretend president. Killing him is our CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY! Numerous other posts complained that Secret Service was stopping people like him from taking the shot. Dutcher even told a detective in no uncertain terms that his threat was serious and   he would not have said what he said if he didn t intend to carry it out.  In fact, he told Secret Service his intent was to  circumvent security and figure out how to shoot (Obama) with a slingshot.  Dutcher, referencing the Biblical story of David and Goliath, told law enforcement that he could easily kill a human Bart Simpson style.Each of the many times he threatened the President could have landed him in prison for up to five years and cost him $250,000. Despite the very real nature of his promise to murder President Obama, the would-be assassin was only sentenced to three years in prison and three years of supervised release.This is exactly why conservatives feel it is acceptable to threaten the President. No matter how clear their intentions, no matter how many times they explain the ways they will  exucute  (to use Dutcher s word) Barack Obama, they receive the equivalent of a slap on the wrist.Dutcher will likely be seen as a martyr to the Revolution by our frenemies on the Right, but the truth is that he is a symptom of a cancer in society that we must cut out before it is too late.Featured image via Addicting Info archives",News,"March 26, 2016"

I don t feel safe anymore.   Express UKThe violence against  the rich  by African immigrants isn t limited to Europe.A female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a TV interview, related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her.

Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims, and residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this isn t the first time a group of Somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.Here s a preview of what it looks like when police are overwhelmed by migrants who come from violent cultures who have no intention of assimilating or following the law:Anarchists, Immigrants, Youths Riot in France  Set Fire to Cops Car  Armed Police Officer shows Amazing Restraint",politics,"Feb 2, 2017"

 WATCH: Bill Maher’s Hilarious Opening Monologue Will Make Trump Explode With Rage,"Bill Maher is definitely not afraid of Donald Trump.Ever since Trump was sworn-in on inauguration day he has been openly whining about media reports on the size of his inauguration crowd, insisting that his crowd was the largest in history despite photographic evidence that shows otherwise.Trump s inauguration was absolutely pathetic and his obsession with the crowd size only demonstrates that he is way too thin-skinned to be president.As you may recall, Trump took a moment during a visit to CIA Headquarters to claim that his crowd filled the National Mall and numbered at least  1.5 million.  He also threatened the media for reporting the real numbers.For the record, here s a side by side of President Obama s inauguration, which drew a record 1.8 million people compared to Trump s in 2017.

He can t stand it that when it comes to the size of the crowd, Obama s was bigger. This is about c*ck, right? This is about d*ck! This is about a guy who never brought a woman to orgasm! He probably thinks it s rigged. The rest of the monologue was funny, too, but Trump is going to explode after he hears that one joke.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a petty loser who can t handle any amount of criticism.

" Cruz Supporter Blasts Trump’s Wife For Being Foreign, Makes Sexist Attack (VIDEO)","Ted Cruz s presidential campaign is gaining a reputation of going into the gutter during the Republican primary so far, and it appears that his supporters making media appearances are going there as well.Appearing on Fox Business, Cruz booster Andrea McWilliams argued that especially in light of the recent death of First Lady Nancy Reagan, Republican primary voters should consider the potential first ladies in the field, and went on to attack Donald Trump s wife, Melania. If Donald trump is elected, Mrs. Trump will be the first first lady that has ever posed nude; the first first lady that s the third wife [of the president]; and the first foreign-born first lady in this century.  She said,  by contrast,  Cruz s wife Heidi would be  the first pro-life first lady. Taken aback by the claim, host Neil Cavuto pressed McWilliams to expound on her attack.Asked by Cavuto  what difference  any of it made, McWilliams said it was  critically important. You ve been covering Nancy Reagan, look at what an influencer she was to her husband.   I think posing nude speaks to character,  she said.It s also worth noting that McWilliams seemed to be concerned that Melania Trump is foreign born. She is originally from Slovenia. She married Trump in 2005, and is his third wife.When she was dating Trump she was still a model, and posed in a nude photo shoot for GQ magazine inside and on Trump s private jet.It s interesting for a Cruz supporter to go this route, as his campaign has been the closest associated with risqu  content so far. A few weeks ago his campaign released an ad featuring an adult film star, and when it was revealed the panicked campaign pulled the ad.

BREAKING: HILLARY CAMPAIGN Planned Fake “GRASSROOTS” Millennial Movement To Steal Bernie Followers,"Wikileaks released another email showing how phony Hillary s campaign has been from the start. Americans should never believe the polls. Hillary has NEVER given Americans a reason to want to get behind her. Its why she and her camp, with the help of the media are constantly manufacturing what appears to be (but really is not) support for her candidacy. The most HILL-larious part of this whole story is that Hillary s camp planned to use the young Tallahassee Mayor, Andrew Gillum to launch Hillary s fake  grassroots  group after he gave a speech at the DNC about how  trust  in government  can be restored! Here is the attachment to an email addressed to Hillary s campaign manager, John Podesta:CONCEPT PAPEROBJECTIVE:Mobilize young voter participation for the 2016 election in support of Hillary ClintonSTRATEGY: Use young elected officials and entertainers to build a  grassroots  movement of under 40 voters as a vehicle to migrate support for Bernie into activism for Hillary.OPERATIONAL GOALS: Identify young elected officials (YEOs)across the country to become the face of a new organization that is focused on a progressive future. These young elected officials would promote both the organization, the ideas embraced by it and the need for civic engagement with an immediate focus on involvement in the 2016 election. They would be seen as the faces of a new progressivist movement that combines noble goals with political realities resulting in real progress.The organization would be built around a group of ideas or concepts as opposed to parties or individuals. The ideas should always reinforce the message that the under 40 generation needs to engage politically to shape their own future. Building the New Economy, Creating an Empowerment Society, Transitioning to a Sustainable World, Tearing Down Barriers are all phrases which might be included in the messaging. Support for the Hillary would be included in the messaging but initially as tangential to it, i.e.  if you support these things then there really isn t another choice but her . Over time the messaging would transition more into the actionable item of involvement in the campaign and support for its efforts.The organization should be built around a Ready for Hillary type model: grassroots driven, limited engagement of the principal, both an organizational and small dollar fundraising component, centered on-line and in venues frequented by under 40 s   college campuses, with a big emphasis on community colleges, nightclubs, athletic events, etc.The group should be branded separately from the campaign so people who engage with it feel like they created and own it as opposed to feeling swallowed by an organization that defeated them. A distinct name, artwork, website, spokespeople etc would be desired.TACTICS:The program should be launched initially in one state and then expand out. It should be seen as growing and spreading. We want people calling and asking if they can set one up in their state as opposed to forcing the model on them.The YEO s in that state would announce the formation of their group stating theirs goal to help elect a progressive President and engage young people with a goal of making sure their voices are heard and they are ready to participate. It should feel almost like  we got together and decided to do this on our own . Depending on the organizational model, they could say they all support Hillary and are doing it to help but there are bigger and longer term objectives here, etc. Ideally you could say something like the campaign is providing limited resources but has agreed any funds you raise will be directed into youth outreach.They would then do a series of event which would be a college campus  town hall  during the day and a club type event that night. The  town hall  with students would be informal with talking with students about goals, dreams, political reality, how government can make things happen, how sometimes it doesn t, etc. It would end in a pitch for them to become engaged politically to build a progressive future. Later in the evening, these YEO s would attend and speak briefly at a campaign event in a bar/club featuring a local DJ or entertainer and has a nominal contribution as part of attendence. The campus event will be used to build buzz for the second event as well as the campaign itself. As momentum grows for the organization, bigger names would be brought in for the  town hall  events as well as bigger artists for the  club  events, furthering the momentum. Eventually, HRC/WJC/CVC as well as VP and Spouse would be integrated into these events but it should be seen as them coming to the  movement  as opposed to them trying to take it over.RECOMMENDATIONS:This program be launched by Mayor Andre Gillum in Florida. Goal would be early AprilTarget is to have 10 people at launchDo events in Miami, Palm Beach, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando in April.Convene a group of National YEO s in May/June to discuss their involvement.Have organization functioning in 5 battlegound states by June 1   Florida, Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina?",politics,"Oct 24, 2016"
BREAKING: CLOSE AIDE TO BILL CLINTON: “I arranged for $50 million in payments to Bill Clinton”,"A close aide to Bill Clinton said he arranged for $50 million in payments for the former president, part of a complicated mingling of lucrative business deals and charity work of the Clinton Foundation mapped out in a memo released by WikiLeaks on Wednesday.The report was written by Doug Band, who has transitioned from his job as a Clinton aide to a partner in Teneo Consulting, a company whose client roster now includes some of the biggest companies in the world. Along the way, Band wrote, he also pushed his clients and contacts to donate millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, and to help win business deals for Bill Clinton.Band wrote the memo in November 2011 to John Podesta, now chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, and sent copies to other key Clinton aides, apparently to explain and justify his work in the face of criticism from others in the Clinton orbit   notably Chelsea Clinton.WikiLeaks has been releasing thousands of hacked emails from Podesta s account in recent weeks, revealing the rivalries and controversies roiling inside the Clinton family network as Hillary Clinton prepared to run for president.In the memo, Band depicts himself as the indispensable linchpin of the Clinton family s finances even as he acknowledges that the arrangement is unusual:  We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles,  Band wrote.A spokesman for the Clinton campaign declined to comment; the campaign has refused to confirm whether the emails are authentic. Band did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the November 2011 memo, Band lays out how he founded Teneo five months earlier with Declan Kelly, one of Hillary Clinton s top fundraisers during her 2008 presidential campaign. When Clinton became secretary of State, Kelly was named an envoy to Northern Ireland, holding the post even as he continued to represent several clients. Rightly or wrongly,  Band said, because other fundraisers couldn t deliver, he and Kelly pushed their clients to donate to the foundation; he also lined up speaking and consulting deals for Bill Clinton. In some cases, it worked the other way, with Teneo winning consulting contracts from foundation donors.One example, he said, was Laureate International University, the for-profit international school that donated more than $1.4 million to the Clinton Foundation and was paying Bill Clinton $3.5 million a year to serve as  honorary chancellor. The company paid Clinton more than $17 million before the relationship ended last year, as Hillary Clinton was launching her presidential bid.Read more: Detroit News",politics,"Oct 27, 2016"
JIMMY KIMMEL: Republicans ‘Should Be Praying for God to Forgive Them’ For Las Vegas Massacre,"Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel opened his program Monday with a ten-minute political rant about Sunday s mass murder in Las Vegas, saying  now is the time for political debate  about gun control.Dismissing as inadequate calls for prayers for the victims by President Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Jimmy Kimmel Live host said:  they should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Kimmel railed against lawmakers who  won t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip,  insisting that their  thoughts and your prayers are insufficient. The comic responded to those saying there was nothing that could have been done to stop Sunday s attack.  I disagree with that intensely,  Kimmel said,  because of course there s something we can do about it.   BreitbartMeanwhile, reports are coming out that Kimmel has increased his security detail  which consists of highly-trained, off-duty police officers.According to a report from The Blast on Monday, late night host Jimmy Kimmel has been bulking up on his security for his Jimmy Kimmel Live! show tapings, including the addition of  highly-trained, off-duty police officers  at both the front and back entrances. Per the report:Sources close to the show tell The Blast that ever since Kimmel re-ignited his campaign against the Republicans  health care proposals, the comedian has had some issues with protestors at the show.We re told the show has responded by adding security to the tapings   increasing personnel at both the front and back entrances.

“SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL” Releases Damaging Information On Russian Involvement In Syria Gas Attack,"This is very curious! The AP is reporting a story from a  Senior U.S. Official  on Russia s involvement in the Syria gas attack. This official is saying that the we have evidence that Russia knew about the chemical weapon attack before it happened. This Associated Press report is interesting for a couple of reasons. Is the release of this information by a Senior U.S. Official an effort to embarrass Rex Tillerson or cause trouble for his trip to Russia?Tillerson will be in Russia in 36 hours so this will only add to the tension. Could this actually be the strategy of the Trump administration to give the upper hand to the U.S.?WASHINGTON (AP)   A senior U.S. official says the United States has concluded that Russia knew in advance of Syria s chemical weapons attack last week.The official says a Russian-operated drone flew over a hospital in Syria as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment.Hours after the drone left, a Russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons.Until Monday, U.S. officials had said they weren t sure if the drone was operated by Russia or Syria. The senior official said it still wasn t clear who was flying the jet that bombed the hospital.The official said the presence of the drone couldn t have been a coincidence, and that Russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming and that victims were seeking treatment.The official wasn t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity.

 Shonda Rhimes Gives Donald Trump A HILARIOUS Education In ‘Late Term Abortion’ (TWEET),"During the last presidential debate, many people were live-tweeting their responses to the candidate s answers. One of those people happened to be the legendary Shonda Rhimes, creator of pretty much every amazing drama on ABC at the moment.During one point in the debate, Donald Trump was talking about late-term abortion. However, he didn t seem to have all his facts right, and he somehow thinks that babies are ripped from the womb in the 9th month.Not being able to refrain from Trump s clear lack of knowledge of women, pregnancy, abortion or the birthing process, Rhimes tweeted out: FYI:  ripping baby from womb in 9th month  is called C-section. #VaginaEducation FYI: ""ripping baby from womb in 9th month"" is called C-section. #VaginaEducation  shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) October 20, 2016Which is exactly what it is. If a women is nine months pregnant and wants the baby removed, they would do that via C-section, and the baby would be fully developed. If the baby was removed for any other reason that late in the pregnancy it s likely for some tragic reason and Trump really has to keep his orange mouth shut because he has no idea what he s talking about.On the other hand, Hillary Clinton s response during the debate regarding late-term abortion was absolutely on point. She said:Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who have, toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and health of the mother taken into account. However, Trump doesn t seem to care about women or the life of the mother and is instead catering to his dimwitted base who has no knowledge of basic science, let alone what goes on when a woman is pregnant. Nor does he himself even care to know. He just knows how to sell a point to his audience. He is, after all, a scam artist businessman.Good on Rhimes for giving Trump some  Vagina Education    it d be nice if he learned a little about them before just walking up and grabbing them.Featured Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Vulture Festival   Twitter",News,"October 20, 2016"
HOW BRITAIN Almost LOST Their Independence To Muslim Immigrants Who Voted Overwhelmingly For Globalist EU,"Are you paying attention America? Yesterday, the UK voted to leave the European Union. On referendum day, Lord Ashcroft surveyed 12,369 people after they had voted to help explain the result   who voted for which outcome, and what lay behind their decision.Lord Ashcroft polls   70% of Muslims voted to remain in the UE. This provides additional refutation of the claim made by our rulers that immigration doesn t change anything. In the Scottish referendum, a majority of people born in Scotland voted for independence; it was the votes of (first-generation) immigrants that swayed the result in favour of maintaining the United Kingdom. Now, in this second referendum, the British people as a whole might well have lost their independence because of the votes of African and Asian colonists who only arrived in their country within the last few decades. In the end, this was narrowly averted. But it shows the extent to which the demographic window is closing on the hopes for European survival.White voters voted to leave the EU by 53% to 47%. Two thirds (67%) of those describing themselves as Asian voted to remain, as did three quarters (73%) of black voters. Nearly six in ten (58%) of those describing themselves as Christian voted to leave; seven in ten Muslims voted to remain.A majority of those who backed the Conservative in 2015 voted to leave the EU (58%), as did more than 19 out of 20 UKIP supporters. Nearly two thirds of Labour and SNP voters (63% and 64%), seven in ten Liberal Democrats and three quarters of Greens, voted to remain.Nearly half (49%) of leave voters said the biggest single reason for wanting to leave the EU was  the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK . One third (33%) said the main reason was that leaving  offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.  Just over one in eight (13%) said remaining would mean having no choice  about how the EU expanded its membership or its powers in the years ahead.  Only just over one in twenty (6%) said their main reason was that  when it comes to trade and the economy, the UK would benefit more from being outside the EU than from being part of it. A small majority of those who voted to remain think that for most children growing up today, life will be better than it was for their parents; leavers think the opposite by 61% to 39%. Leavers see more threats than opportunities to their standard of living from the way the economy and society are changing, by 71% to 29%   more than twice the margin among remainers.Nearly three quarters (73%) of remainers think life in Britain is better today than it was 30 years ago; a majority (58%) of those who voted to leave say it is worse.

KATHY GRIFFIN Actually BRAGGED About Wanting To “Beat Down” 11-Yr Old Barron Trump 6 Months Ago,"The outspoken liberal comedian posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields in which she was seen holding a bloodied mask of President Trump.Donald Trump was quick to condemn her on Twitter:TMZ later reported that 11-year old Barron Trump actually saw the image of his bloodied and decapitated father while watching TV.TMZ reports: Barron Trump was watching TV & saw @kathygriffin holding the severed head. He thought it was his dad. My heart is broken.  Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) May 31, 2017Melania Trump weighed in on the horrific image her 11-yr old son was subjected to with this statement:  As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing. When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it. It s a question a lot of comedians are asking themselves lately: What should comedy look like during the Trump presidency? Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities,  Kathy Griffin told Vulture at the Equality Now Gala Tuesday night.  For me, that s Trump and all things Trump. It s not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down. It s his turn. So I m happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump   and also to Barron. You know a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald, my edge is that I ll go direct for Barron. I m going to get in ahead of the game. So, of course, Griffin supported Rosie O Donnell when she tweeted a video asking if Barron Trump, 10-year-old son of Donald and Melania, was on the autism spectrum.  After the beat down he gave her, she can say whatever she wants to say to that piece of shit,  Griffin said before correcting herself.  Oh, that s President Piece of Shit.

" ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Holds Children At Gunpoint, Lectures Them About Crime","On Wednesday, three young Washington teens received a terrifying  lesson  from one of the people the NRA says will save us from any and all danger. Kitsap Sheriff s deputies are investigating an incident in which a man held three 13-year-olds at gunpoint while he lectured them about crime in the area.The teens, who were playing an innocent game of basketball in a community court, say the man approached them. According to the kids, he had been dropped off by another man in a silver pickup truck with orange cab lights. He shined a flashlight at the children then pointed a semi-automatic pistol and told them he was not  playing around,  ordering them face-down on the ground.The Kitsap Sun reports that the man, who is described as a caucasian in his 60s or 70s with white hair, interrogated them about what they were doing, and informed the frightened teens that there had been a rash of car thefts and vandalism in the area. He told the kids he had been asked to  investigate  by a neighbor.After the interrogation, the pickup truck returned and another white man got, heavyset with grayish hair, got out and shook the kids  hands, patting one on the back. The gun-toting gentleman got in the truck and they drove off. Police are still investigating the incident.Unfortunately, this is where we are at in America. Two men, empowered by the NRA and Republicans  rhetoric that places them as judge, jury, and executioner, conducted their own firearm-assisted  interrogation  against three children who had done nothing worse than playing basketball in the evening.

He is currently in the field until Friday and unable to answer detailed questions, but a Medium post authored by the Infantry Officer details some of his views. He wrote, following the murder of socialist Heather Heyer during the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rallies:The toppling of the Confederate Soldiers Memorial in Durham, North Carolina has sounded the death knell for any and all displays of Confederate aggrandizement in the United States as well as abroad. Yet, the shadow of the Confederacy and its efforts to preserve slavery is not limited to the southern United States.The response to Rapone s tweet has been mostly supportive though some have raised concerns about his personal and job safety and the image is quickly approaching viral status. He later sought to clear up any confusion by posting another image of himself. This time, sporting a Che Guevara t-shirt underneath his half-buttoned uniform, Rapone tweeted,  In case there was any lingering doubt, hasta la victoria siempre,  a popular slogan attributed to the late Marxist revolutionary, physician, and guerrilla leader who was ultimately killed and captured by the United States  own CIA.

BREAKING: OBAMA WILL VETO BILL Unanimously Passed By Congress Allowing 9-11 Victims To Sue Saudi Arabia,"This should come as a surprise to no one Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the worst terror attack in history, in which 15 Saudi citizens, among 19 Muslim hijackers, murdered nearly 3,000 Americans on 9/11.Barack Obama s White House announced today they are spitting right in 9-11 victims faces.The U.S. Congress passed a bill   unanimously   that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue governments like Saudi Arabia who   we now know for certain   were involved in the attack.The bill went right to President Obama s desk.But today, the White House announced Obama will VETO the bill.Unbelievable.From CNN:President Barack Obama will veto a bill that would allow terror victims of the attacks on September 11, 2001, to sue Saudi Arabia, the White House said Monday. That s the plan,  White House press secretary Josh Earnest said when asked if the President planned to veto the bill, saying it would  complicate diplomatic relations. Earnest defended the administration s stance against the bill saying it is not  an effective, forceful way for us to respond to terrorism. Lawmakers are expected to attempt to override the veto, and if successful, would mark the first time in Obama s presidency.Utterly disgraceful, even for Obama. Now his infamous  bow  to the Saudi king takes on a new, and sickening meaning.In April, a senior Saudi prince urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election, after Trump promised to  blow the lid  off secret documents proving that the Saudi government helped plan the 9/11 Attacks.Via: Top Right News ",politics,"Sep 12, 2016"
"WHY THIS BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRAT STRONGHOLD County Is Still Fighting For Trump: “He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse” [VIDEO]","AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage. There s the school system, and a prison, and that s pretty much it. Outside of town, population 622, roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too, then up into the hills of Appalachia, with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the American imagination.Whitt slides a medical bill across the table. Looks like this one is the new helmet,  he says, and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt: $3,995. They will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed $40,000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition. His skull was shaped like an egg, the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be. Tommy, their baby boy with big blue eyes, has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should.They pay $800 a month for insurance. But when they took their baby to a surgeon in Cincinnati, they learned it was out of network. In-network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries, so they opted to pay out of pocket. At the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor, it would have all been free.This represents the cracks in America s institutions that drove Whitt, a lifelong Democrat, from supporting President Barack Obama to buying a  Make America Great Again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch. Many of their welfare-dependent neighbors, he believes, stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead. Where s the fairness in that?  he asks.But Whitt doesn t blame Trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better. He blames the  brick wall  in Washington, the politicians he sees as blocking everything Trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish.A third of people here live in poverty. Just 9 percent of adults have a college degree, but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do, and those jobs have gotten harder to find.Many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by Obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs. When Trump bemoans the  American carnage  of lost factories and lost faith, it feels like he s talking to the people in these Appalachian hills. When he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way, they embrace him.Coal has ticked up since Trump took office; mining companies have added 1,200 jobs across the country since his inauguration, more than 180 of them in Kentucky. But industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss Trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky. Coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation: far cheaper natural gas, mechanization, thinning Appalachian seams. With the opposition he s had, I think he s pulling the plow pretty good,  offers Wes Lewis from the card table. A few months ago, he says, he saw four brand-new coal rigs going through town.  For the longest time, under Obama, all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers, because people turned belly up, they went broke. Lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work. He s noticed new trucks in people s driveways, too, which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures. These tiny signs stack up to him as proof. Lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls:  Made in Mexico,  it reads. Trump s bringing them back,  he says.Lewis, a registered Democrat, trusts Trump because he trusts his values. And because of that, he trusts Trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him. If the factories and mines don t come back, he ll blame the opposition. If there isn t a wall on the Mexico border, he says, it won t be because Trump didn t try. If investigators find his campaign colluded with Russians, it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down.Go HERE to read entire story.",politics,"Dec 27, 2017"
BIG MISTAKE? MASKED ANTIFA COWARDS Target KID ROCK’S DETROIT Concert Opening Of Little Caesars Arena Tonight,"Detroit s own Kid Rock will open the all-new Little Caesars Arena on Tuesday, Sept. 12, but a group is planning a rally outside of the arena ahead of his concert.The rally will take place from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. outside of the arena. The concert is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m.According to the Facebook event, the group plans to  rally against symbols of white supremacy and hate in our amazing city of Detroit. Kid Rock has previously used the Confederate Flag at his concerts, and in 2015, the National Action Network asked General Motors to stop sponsoring his tour over the use of the flag.At the time, General Motors found Kid Rock has not flown the Confederate Flag since around 2011.  WXYZStephen Henderson, the race-obsessed Editorial Page Editor of the Detroit Free Press had this to say about Kid Rock and the Illitches, who never gave up on the city of Detroit, and continued to throw tens of millions of dollars at new ventures, even when many of us in the suburbs believed they were wasting their money on a city that could never be resecutated:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem.Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his embarrassing attempts to shame the white man, that will help to keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well ",politics,"Sep 5, 2017"
THE TRUTH ABOUT Why SORE LOSER Obama Is Using “Russian Hackers” Story [VIDEO],"Make no mistake: it s payback time. In ordering up a  deep dive  into possible Russian interference in the election of Donald Trump, sore loser Barack Obama wants to delegitimize the real estate magnate s win. His motive? Punishing Trump for the years the mogul spent publicly questioning whether Obama was an American citizen, which cast doubts on the legitimacy of his presidency. Ah, how sweet the revenge. And how pitiful.Never mind the ACTUAL exchange that was caught on a hot mic between Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, where Obama promised to have more flexibility to deal with missile defense issues after the 2012 presidential election.President Obama has searched high and, increasingly, low, for the reasons he and Hillary Clinton lost the election. He has blamed Fox News, insufficient grass-roots campaigning by Hillary,  fake news , and now has singled out Russian meddling for the loss of 194 of 207 counties that voted for him in either 2008 or 2012.The suggestion is that Vladimir Putin wanted Trump to win; the liberal media has hinted darkly that the president-elect and his campaign team have  ties  to the Russian head of state.As most Americans review Trump s defense and security picks, the notion that the new administration will go easy on our adversaries   including Russia   is laughable. Retired General James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to head Defense, has described Russia s annexation of Crimea as a  severe  threat, one underestimated by the Obama White House. Mattis is not to be trifled with.On Sunday, Ambassador John Bolton claimed  that hacks during the election season could have been  a false flag  operation   possibly committed by the Obama administration itself.In an interview with Fox News  Eric Shawn, Bolton questioned why FBI Director James Comey said during the investigation of Hillary Clinton s private server, there was no direct evidence found of foreign intelligence service penetration, but cyber fingerprints were found in regards to the presidential election.The media has ignored the reality that Moscow s possible hacking of DNC and Podesta s emails were retaliation for Hillary Clinton s assertions that Russian elections in 2011 were  rigged    an accusation that infuriated Putin. When protests erupted in Russia over the election outcome, Putin blamed Clinton.  She said they were dishonest and unfair,  Putin said at the time. He accused then Secretary of State Clinton for giving  a signal  to demonstrators organized  with the support of the U.S. State Department We need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs,  Putin said. Does this sound familiar? Turnabout is fair play, and Putin has made it clear that if we mess with his elections, he will mess with ours.Obama knows this. Politico reported in a July piece entitled  Why Putin Hates Hillary  that the Russian leader s anger about Clinton s interference was  communicated directly to President Barack Obama.  Former administration officials involved with Russian policy say the Kremlin saw Clinton as taking a harder line against Russia    reset  notwithstanding   than others in the White House.   And they say Putin sees Clinton as a forceful proponent of  regime change  policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival. That is why the Russians may have tried to undermine Hillary Clinton, not because they see Trump as an ally. Like most of the world, Moscow no doubt expected Clinton to win. Coming into office weakened by Putin s meddling would have undoubtedly pleased Moscow no end.Obama s call for an investigation is transparently bogus. First, the CIA offers up only scant circumstantial evidence   evidence that even the New York Times admits  does not support firm judgements    to make the charge that Russia worked to favor Trump. The FBI isn t even on board with the conclusion.Second, everyone knows that no serious inquiry could possibly be completed by January 20, when Trump will be sworn in. The federal government operates with glacial pacing; Obama knows the report will likely never be completed, and so the issue of Russian hacking will hang like a cloud   like the  birther  rumors   over the Trump White House.While muttering about how the need for  transparency  might inspire the investigation into the hacking, the Times et al ignore the reality: the emails released via WikiLeaks that outed cheating by the DNC in favor of Hillary Clinton, or showed how disrespectful her camp was of Catholics and average Americans, actually increased the transparency of the election. The United States should not tolerate cyberattacks from a foreign government; nor should we tolerate cheating in our politics.Obama is still smarting from having put himself on the line during the campaign, telling the Black Congressional Caucus, for instance,  I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. He made Hillary s campaign all about him, but she lost anyway. That has to sting. Especially since Americans, in choosing Trump, also chose to undo most of Obama s most precious accomplishments.

GERMAN CARNIVAL CANCELLED Over Fears Of Muslim Refugee Sex Attacks,"The citizens of Rheinberg, Germany can thank the mind-numbingly short-sighted progressives, who thought a country with open borders was a good idea In Rheinberg, in the Wesel district, for the first time a carnival procession has been cancelled with reference to the refugee situation. The Shrove Tuesday procession in the Orsoy district will not take place. A spokesman for the city of Rheinberg made reference to the New Year s Eve attacks in Cologne: it cannot be excluded that refugees would visit the procession and through, for example, excessive alcohol consumption, scenes like those in Cologne would occur.In Orsoy, where around 3000 people live, there is a central accommodation institution for the state of North Rhine Westphalia in a former hospital. 200 refugees live there; at the start of February another 300 will come.This situation contains a  potential for danger , said the city spokesman. Most refugees are not familiar with carnival processions; in addition, many North Africans live in Orsoy. According to initial information, the perpetrators in Cologne were also mainly North Africans. 650 criminal complaints have now been filed there. Via: rp online",left-news,"Jan 15, 2016"
BREAKING: 296 Hillary E-mails Just Released Exposing The “Bad Cop” At Hillary’s Side 24/7,"Huma Abedin is Hillary s  Bad cop  and is exposed as a scheming supporter of Hillary in the just released e-mails by Judicial Watch:Another 296 pages of Hillary Clinton s emails were released Tuesday   exposing key Clinton aides doing favors for billionaires and, on one occasion, leaving the then-secretary of state s daily schedule in an unlocked hotel room.The documents were released by Judicial Watch, which is suing to recover Clinton s emails under Freedom of Information Act laws.In an April 2009 email to Clinton s State Department aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, President Clinton s former body man, Doug Band, the founder of corporate consultant Teneo, urgently asked them to set up a meeting with an ambassador for a major donor to the Clinton Foundation. We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re lebanon. As you know, he s key guy there and to us and is loved in lebanon.

 WATCH: GOP Governor Tells Christians To Martyr Themselves For Right To Discriminate,"This is why we have separation of church and state, to guard this country from religious whackos like Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.In April, Bryant signed a sweeping anti-LGBT law that allows public and private employers to discriminate against gay people and anyone else such as interracial couples, atheists, and people who have had premarital sex if they claim to have a  sincerely held religious belief. This abuse of religious liberty by Republicans has now reached fever pitch as many red states are adopting similar laws as a way to be bigoted assholes toward to certain groups of people. And now Bryant, despite being criticized by people in his own state, is calling upon Christians across the country to martyr themselves for the right to discriminate.During the right-wing Watchmen on the Wall conference, Family Research Council hate group leader Tony Perkins introduced Bryant as the winner of the first ever  Samuel Adams Religious Freedom Award  for passing the bigoted law in his state, which means Samuel Adams is probably rolling in his grave.Perkins declared that all elected officials should be  ministers of God  and Bryant kissed Perkins  ass by comparing him to David in the Biblical story of David and Goliath. I remember in Sunday school, reading one of my favorite stories. It was about a giant, a bad giant, who came into a valley one day and he called to the Israelites,  Send down your champion and let me vanquish him.  We were in that valley, but Tony Perkins was there with us. He was there as surely as Our Lord and Savior, as surely as the God of all gods stood there with us. And I can tell you how fortunate we are in this nation and in this organization to have a man of faith and leadership in Tony. God bless you for what you do. Bryant then proceeded to whine about the opposition to the discriminatory law he signed claiming that they don t know the history of Christians being persecuted and said Christians are willing to stand in line for crucifixion to secure their right to discriminate. They don t know that Christians have been persecuted throughout the ages. They don t know that if it takes crucifixion, we will stand in line before abandoning our faith and our belief in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So if we are going to stand, now is the time and this is the place. Here s the video via Right Wing Watch:This is proof of how insane conservative  Christians  have become. They imagine that they are being persecuted because they aren t allowed to refuse service to people they hate. Of course, if Christians were really being persecuted in this country they would be dragged out in the streets and beaten or killed as they are in countries where Christianity is a minority religion. That s what real persecution looks like.But Bryant is hardly the first Mississippi governor to use religion to justify bigotry. As a two-term governor and US Senator from the state in the 1920s through late 1940s, Bilbo believed that God sanctioned racism.According to Think Progress:For Senator Bilbo racism was more that just an ideology, it was a sincerely held religious belief. In a book entitled Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization, Bilbo wrote that  [p]urity of race is a gift of God . . . . And God, in his infinite wisdom, has so ordained it that when man destroys his racial purity, it can never be redeemed.  Allowing  the blood of the races [to] mix,  according to Bilbo, was a direct attack on the  Divine plan of God.  There  is every reason to believe that miscengenation and amalgamation are sins of man in direct defiance to the will of God. Another Mississippi governor named Ross Barnett was still repeating the same justification in 1960.  The good Lord was the original segregationist,  he claimed.Segregation has since been outlawed, but conservatives are still using the same argument to justify their bigotry and it s going to be fun watching a federal court put them in their place once again.Featured image via screenshot ",News,"June 1, 2016"

" This One Factor Determines If You’re A Trump Supporter, And It’s Not What You Think","Trump supporters have a lot in common. They lack education. They re a bunch of horrible racists. They want to  make America great again  by viciously beating African-American protesters and homeless people. The idea of keeping brown people out of  Murika appeals to them. His appeal to racists is so great that white supremacists are actively campaigning for him and terrorist groups are using his hate speech to recruit. But did you know that one factor you haven t thought of defines Trump support better than jingoism, racism, homophobia, extreme anti-Muslim sentiments, or a desire to build a gigantic wall so we never have to even look at a Hispanic person again?Politico s Matthew MacWilliams says he has discovered one factor that predicts whether or not someone is a Trump voter:In fact, I ve found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether a voter supports Trump and it s not race, income or education levels: It s authoritarianism.That s right, Trump s electoral strength and his staying power have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations. And because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate, among Democrats as well as Republicans, it s very possible that Trump s fan base will continue to grow.MacWilliams just finished conducting a national poll which sampled 1,800 voters across the nation.  I found that education, income, gender, age, ideology and religiosity had no significant bearing on a Republican voter s preferred candidate,  he writes.  Only two of the variables I looked at were statistically significant: authoritarianism, followed by fear of terrorism, though the former was far more significant than the latter. MacWilliams explains that Trump s pledge to make  America great again  as well as his horrific suggestions that Muslims be banned from the United States, wear special ID badges if they re already here, and be rounded up into concentration camps (as well, of course, as his Great Wall of Murika), all cater to authoritarian inclinations:Authoritarianism is not a new, untested concept in the American electorate. Since the rise of Nazi Germany, it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in social science. While its causes are still debated, the political behavior of authoritarians is not. Authoritarians obey. They rally to and follow strong leaders. And they respond aggressively to outsiders, especially when they feel threatened.This, of course, describes Trump supporters perfectly. Frighteningly, authoritarianism (while prevalent among Republicans) is not limited to the Right. In the 2008 Democratic primary, the political scientist Marc Hetherington found that authoritarianism mattered more than income, ideology, gender, age and education in predicting whether voters preferred Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama,  MacWilliams notes.  But Hetherington has also found, based on 14 years of polling, that authoritarians have steadily moved from the Democratic to the Republican Party over time  since they began to embrace civil rights, gay rights, and other hallmarks of liberalism that are common in the party today.MacWilliams notes that authoritarianism is not  a statistically significant factor in the Democratic primary race  thus far, but  it does appear to be playing an important role on the Republican side,  as 49 percent of Republicans score  in the top quarter of the authoritarian scale. MacWilliams  poll asked voters some simple questions about parenting to gauge authoritarianism:  whether it is more important for the voter to have a child who is respectful or independent; obedient or self-reliant; well-behaved or considerate; and well-mannered or curious. Based on these questions, Trump was the only candidate Republican or Democrat whose support among authoritarians was statistically significant,  he concludes. This, combined with the 52% of respondents who live in fear of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, gives us something to fear. While it s easy to say President Trump  can t happen here    that Americans won t stand for the ideological reincarnation of Adolf Hitler being elected   MacWilliams points out that it s time that Democrats and all who oppose fascism begin taking Trump seriously.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 17, 2016"

Warren is strong and not about to quit her fight against corruption where it stands on Wall Street any time soon.

BALTIMORE PURGES CONFEDERATE STATUES In Dark Of Night…MAYOR Explains: “I did not want to endanger people in my own city”,"In a city whose former Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, told police officers to  stand down  in the middle of a full-blown riot started by Black Lives Matter activists, Baltimore s new mayor Catherine Pugh, has now ordered the city to be whitewashed of any history that pertains to the Civil War era.In a stealth purging of history, the city of Baltimore removed four Confederate statues from city property under cover of night early Tuesday morning.City crews began the destruction of the monuments just before midnight and finished by 5:30 a.m., the Hill reported.The city council quietly approved the removal late on Monday in a unanimous vote.

I am a responsible person, so we moved as quickly as we could.    Breitbart NewsBaltimore Sun: Pugh declined to say how much it cost to remove the statues, or where they had been taken. She said the city would provide cost details soon, but planned to keep the location of the statues secret to avoid conflict.The monuments were loaded onto flatbed trucks and hauled away before sunrise Wednesday, bringing an abrupt end to more than two years of indecision across two mayoral administrations.The four monuments   the Lee-Jackson Monument, a monument to Chief Justice Roger B.

 Alec Baldwin Beat Sean Spicer Over The Head With Sean Hannity AND Gave Us Hope In One Epic Tweetstorm (TWEETS),"Sean Spicer got off to a bit of a rocky start as White House press secretary on Saturday when he embarrassed himself, his President, his country, and pretty much anyone who has so much as heard of the United States, with his trainwreck of a press briefing. Spicer chose to kick off his new, exciting, and likely short career by focusing on the issues that matter the most   like Trump s crowd size.Despite a turnout that was dwarfed many times over by a stampede of Nasty Women descending on Washington D.C. to tell Trump to go f*ck himself, Spicer claimed that This was the largest audience to witness an inauguration. Period!  This was, of course, a gigantic lie. According to Spicer, the crowd only looked small because they used  floor coverings  to protect the grass and this somehow transformed a large percentage of the crowd into vampires who were unable to be captured by a single recording device (though we suppose that white area could have been the tops of Trump fans  hoods creating the illusion of an empty space).Alec Baldwin may not have reprised his role as The Donald this week, much to the dismay of an eager populace, but he did stop by Twitter to have some fun with Spicer, delivering a kick to Sean Hannity s deploraballs for good measure.Sean Spicer reminds me of Sean Hannity: another hopped up, no talent white boy who thinks he's right and clever. Both are neither.  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 22, 2017Baldwin also dropped an important message of hope on Americans, reminding us that the rallies, the marches, the protests, and everything else that causes Donald Trump to cry himself to sleep at night are a good start, but it is up to each and every one of us to keep hope alive because eventually this nightmare will be over and we will work to fix whatever damage he is able to do together.1- All of today's rallies, marches, protests are a beginning.

 Trump’s Lapdog Chris Christie Breaks ALL TIME RECORD As His Career Explodes Into Flames,"Remember when Chris Christie was a contender for the Republican Party presidential nomination? Now imagine Chris Christie remembering that while looking glumly into a mirror, and try not to smile. Despite doing everything politically and humanly possible to try and stay relevant, the Bridgegate scandal and generally shittiness of Christie are preventing him from achieving well, anything. At this point, his career in politics is toast.In fact, he just set an all-time record for exactly how screwed his career is. In the entire history of the Quinnipiac poll, no governor of any state has ever had an approval rating as low as Christie does right now.Here s more:Looking at Christie s personal qualities, New Jersey voters say:Garden State voters say 69   24 percent that President-elect Donald Trump should not offer Christie a job in his administration. Oh how the mighty have fallen. Remember four years ago, when Republican leaders were pleading with New Jersey Gov. Chirstopher Christie to run for president and he looked like a sure thing for reelection   which he was? Now the neighbors have handed him the most dubious of honors, the lowest approval rating ever measured for a governor in the states surveyed by the Quinnipiac University Poll,  said Assistant Poll Director Maurice Carroll. The Gov s job approval numbers get worse every time anyone looks. The last time we looked, May 18, he had a 64   29 percent disapproval rating,  Carroll added.  This could be a long final year for Gov. Christie.

 Laughing Cops Took Turns Shooting Puppy (VIDEO),"On December 10, Chester Pennsylvania police officers shot and killed one-year-old Bear, a mixed breed family dog, who had been rescued by his owners just months before.According to Christie Fry, the owner of the dog, she first encountered Bear when he was just four months old. Three months later, she brought the injured pup home to join her family. Bear came into my life in May as a rescue. He was seven months old and had a broken leg. He was brought into my family and his leg healed better than expected without requiring surgery. He could run and jump like a normal dog. I loved this dog. I fell in love when I first met him as a four month old pup. But two weeks before Christmas, Chester police pumped eight bullets into Bear, as the horrified mother watched from her window.Fry says that she heard Bear barking in the backyard at about 10:00 am that morning. There was construction going on at the house next door. She explains that Bear was securely hooked up on a tie out in the yard, so she didn t see his barking as a cause for concern.About ten minutes later she heard the first gun shots.I hear two gunshots. As I m getting up I hear the third. As soon as I m standing, I can see out my side window. Police. Fourth shot. I look at what they re doing and see my dog on the ground. My dog starts screaming. I scream. More shots. Five, six, seven, eight. There s two cops taking turns shooting him with smiles on their faces.Fry says she ran out the door, yelling  What the hell? One of the officers asked  Is this your dog? She says that after she told them  yes  and tried to asked what happened.The response she was given is even more disturbing.The officer said (and I quote)  Well you don t have a dog anymore. He s done now!  and laughed in my face.She goes on to say,My one-year-old puppy that I did everything in my power to save was laying there dead. They shot my dog like he was a human coming at them with a gun.Bear was killed less than two feet from his own dog house, located near the fence that separates Christie Fry s property from the house next door.image credit: puppycidedb.comA photo of his body shows that the fence between the Fry s yard and the neighbor s was open. Bear s body is lying just on the other side of the fence.In a subsequent report filed by the police, officers claimed that they had received  complaints  about Bear.Christie Fry says she was never informed of any complaints from anyone.She was at home at the time that police, accompanied by an animal control officer, came to her home. No one ever knocked on her door or made an effort to contact her.Instead it appears that the cops and the animal control officer went directly to the Fry s backyard, where Bear was barking and restrained.According to animal control, Bear conveniently  broke loose from his tie-out  at that time. He claims that Bear knocked him over. He denies that the dog ever bit him or even tried to bite him.Even if the puppy did knock him down, which is doubtful, why was it necessary for cops to shoot him eight times?Christie Fry has started a Go Fund Me page to raise the money to hire a lawyer. As she points out here, the area around Bear s dog house is bare dirt, as is the neighboring yard. Yet she says that there was not a speck of dust or dirt on the animal control officer s suit, even though he claimed that he was knocked into the dirt by an overly zealous puppy.It seems more likely that the cops went to the Fry s home that day with every intention of killing the dog. They likely thought there was no-one at home to witness the shooting. That would explain why neither animal control nor the police made any attempt to talk to his owner, but headed straight for the backyard instead.Fry acknowledges on her Go Fund Me page that  Bear was a barker.  Was he just getting on the nerves of the construction crew next door?If there were complaints about Bear, police have yet to provide his owner with any details of those complaints.This is not the first time that Chester police have come under fire for killing a dog.In 2013, shocked bystanders captured video of officers opening fire on a pickup truck that was occupied by dogs. The truck was parked directly in front of the high school. Police opened fire, shooting toward both the truck and the school during the student lunch period.Here s more on that story from NBC News: According to Chester mayor John Linder, police followed  all protocol  when they opened fire on the pickup truck, ultimately killing three dogs.Since the dogs involved in that incident were pit bulls, the mayor justified the actions of police by citing a supposed  violent history of the animals in question.  (Here s what happened when our guest writer let a pit bull near his baby.)In a statement published by the Daily Times, Mayor Linder said: (P)olice personnel immediately arrived on scene and assessed the severity of the situation. They took immediate action to ensure that no one in the vicinity could be harmed. Meaning they did exactly what witnesses said they did. They pulled up in their vehicles, grabbed their guns and started shooting  immediately,  into the bed of a pickup truck, in front of a school, while school was in session.According to the mayor, two dogs were killed inside the truck. A third was killed  after it exited the truck.  That means they were shooting at a moving target in front of the school, with people standing all around.The shooting was justified because, according to the mayor, the three dogs were a greater threat to the public than a hailstorm of bullets.The mayor stated that the officers involved in the shooting outside the school were in communication with the city s only animal control officer.It s likely this is the same animal control officer that was on the scene when Bear was killed.In a Twitter post, Fry points out that it s not only police that she wants to see held accountable.Image credit: Chris Christie on Twitter, via PuppycideBDIn his 2013 statement, Mayor Linder also said, We don t want to be known as a place that abuses animals or kills dogs. How about not allowing laughing cops to get away with killing innocent family pets, like Bear, who had never even been accused of biting anyone?Fry is in search of an attorney who will help bring the officers that killed Bear to justice.You can donate to Fry s legal fund here.*Featured image credit: Bear, via Chris Christie on Facebook",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Released Emails Show Carly Fiorina Illegally Working With Her Super PAC,"Carly Fiorina is going to be in a world of hurt for this one. Hillary Clinton s email  scandal  or whatever you want to call it, doesn t even come close to what Carly Fiorina and her super PAC have been doing.The International Business Times reported on Friday that they have email evidence proving that Carly for America (Fiorina s super PAC), has been unlawfully coordinating with campaign stops where Carly has been speaking. As everyone knows, it is a direct violation of FEC laws for super PACS to coordinate with campaigns for any reason. Yet, that doesn t appear to have prevented Carly or her super PAC from trying to work around that law.Up until this point, candidates have tried various measures to exploit loopholes in the law, the most popular one being waiting to announce their presidential runs formally in order to finance their campaigns early on. Carly has done this and taken it to the extreme. Her super PAC now handles all the functions at her campaign stops that a campaign normally would. It s practically unheard of. This by itself isn t a violation, though. The New York Times even said Carly s campaign s strategy of posting her schedule online to alert her super PAC of where she ll be giving speeches so that her super PAC can show up and set up shop, has been a brilliant a run around of the law. That way, they can claim they haven t  coordinated.  They can just show up and claim to be independent.New email evidence shows this not to be true. In fact, if anything, Carly s super PAC has even helped organize the events. The International Business Times reviewed a handful of emails between employees at Winthrop University in South Carolina (where Carly had a September event), staff for the Fiorina campaign, and Carly for America. They found that when an employee had trouble getting in touch with Fiorina about correcting details on an Eventbrite website for the event, that employee then decided to reach out directly to Taylor Manson, a super PAC employee, who coincidentally, was also listed as a person of contact on the Eventbrite page. The lines of campaign coordinating are being blurred more and more. I have a few questions about the location. What is the address of the building? Where should people park? Is there handicap parking available? Do y all plan on putting something out to your students to let them know she ll be there? It didn t take long for Manson to receive an advance walkthrough of the event location. While some might claim that it was the university that acted inappropriately, Larry Noble, a former FEC counsel who works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, says this is evidence that proves that the law has been broken. It s known as an  in-kind contribution,  and super PACs are prohibited from doing so. This fits the larger narrative that the super PAC is basically running the campaign s events. The whole thing frankly makes a mockery of the law. When the super PAC gets there, they hand out flyers, collect voter information, everything campaigns are known for. And   wealthy donors can finance all of it since they can make unlimited contributions to a super PAC but only a few thousand dollars directly to a candidate.That s not the only instance though that will plague Carly s campaign going forward. An event at George Tech last month also appears to be entirely organized by her super PAC, as well, according to emails provided to IBT by the University.Reps for Carly for America have repeatedly stated in the past that the group hasn t coordinated with Fiorina s campaign, but this new information shows otherwise. At the very least, a formal investigation needs to be launched to verify these new allegations.

 Documents Show Clinton Lobbied Congress For Trade Agreements She Publicly And Personally Opposed,"On February 19, the State Department released another batch of emails from Hillary Clinton s years as Secretary of State.Among the documents released are emails showing that Clinton lobbied Congress in support of three U.S. trade agreements in October of 2011.The emails show that Clinton personally contacted members of Congress, urging them to vote in favor of the Columbia Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA), which was bitterly opposed by organized labor, in both the United States and Colombia, as well as human rights organizations around the world.At the same time, Clinton also lobbied Congress in support of free trade agreements with Korea and Panama.During her 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton publicly decried the trade agreements, calling the agreement with Korea  inherently unfair,  and saying I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. But the newly published emails show that, as Secretary of State, Clinton phoned members of Congress, specifically asking them to vote in favor of the agreements.On October 8, 2011, Clinton received the following email from her aide, Huma Abedin.Image credit: video screen capture via foia.state.govIn response, Clinton stated that she had contacted members of Congress to urge them to support the trade agreements.image credit: screen capture foia.state.govimage credit: screen capture foia.state.govAs Secretary of State, Clinton would have been bound to follow the directives of the president and support the policies of the Obama administration, regardless of personal beliefs regarding those policies.However, as Secretary of State, she also played a very important role in developing and informing the White House on foreign policy issues, including trade agreements.In order to better understand the role of the U.S. Secretary of State, according to state.gov, among other things, the person appointed to this position:While there could be a number of reasonable explanations as to why Secretary Clinton changed her positions regarding the trade agreements with Korea and Colombia, the newly released emails are likely to work against her, when it comes to garnering support from organized labor.As reported by International Business Times here, Bill Clinton s partnership with Canadian financier Frank Giustra, and a subsequent joint venture launched by Giustra and former President Clinton in Colombia, are likely to become major issues for the Clinton campaign in the coming months.Clinton s rival for the democratic party s nomination, Bernie Sanders, voted against both the Columbia and Panama free trade agreements. The record shows that Senator Sanders did not vote on the trade agreement with Korea.As voters weigh their options ahead of the 2016 election, Secretary Clinton is likely to face tough questions regarding her support for the Korean and Colombian trade agreements.How she answers those questions will play a major role in whether or not she can win the support of organized labor.Featured image credit from US Embassy Canada via Flickr",News,"February 24, 2016"
 Fox News Bans Gene Simmons For Life For Harassing Staff Off Camera,"Gene Simmons, the 68-year-old Kiss bassist and co-lead singer, contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice for a grand total of three episodes back in 2008, self-proclaimed womanizer, and all-around poster-boy for washed up, aging rock stars who will stop at nothing to keep their names in the rapidly-diminishing spotlight, has stooped to a new low in his battle against irrelevancy   He has been given a lifetime ban from Fox News.When it comes to Fox News, the network has a tendency to be a little lenient on the issue of behavior of sexual nature, a reputation that screams  Hold my beer!  to a man like Gene Simmons. On what was far from his first appearance on the network, Simmons was a guest last Wednesday on Fox and Friends, as well as Fox Business Network s Mornings With Maria, to promote his new book, On Power. Gene Simmons, who claims to know Donald Trump  very well  and that the current President s critics should  get over it,  couldn t be faulted for his onscreen appearance, even helping with the weather report:MUST SEE: @genesimmons helps @JaniceDean with the weather! pic.twitter.com/EFfRQESNuq  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) November 15, 2017Simmons also sat on a panel with Mornings With Maria host Maria Bartiromo and gave his view on the Harvey Weinstein sexual-misconduct case. The lunatics have taken over the insane asylum when respected business entities such as yourself ask guys that like to stick their tongues out what I think of Harvey Weinstein,  Simmons answered.  Okay, I m a powerful and attractive man, and what I m about to say is deadly serious,  he added.  Men are jackasses. From the time we re young we have testosterone. I m not validating it or defending it. As is always the case, however, it was when the cameras weren t rolling that things began to get creepy and also quite hypocritical. According to a knowledgeable Fox News source, Simmons arrived on the studio s fourteenth floor to do an interview with FoxNews.com s entertainment section to promote his book, but also chose to walk into a staff meeting uninvited, opened his shirt and shouted,  Hey chicks, sue me! He didn t stop there, though. The source claims he went on to tell pedophilia-related Michael Jackson jokes, hit two employees on the head with his book while making comparisons on their intelligence based on the sounds, and asked an African-American employee if he was Al Roker.  It was pretty severe,  the source said.Simmons  behavior was reported to a supervisor, who in turn passed the news on to Fox News human-resources executive Kevin Lord, who promptly banned Simmons from the building. He was also permanently barred from appearing on any Fox News or Fox Business Networkprogramming.It seems that Gene Simmons may have had a change of heart over the past week, as he has released the following statement: I have appeared frequently over the years on various Fox News and Fox Business programs and have a tremendous amount of respect for the talented women and men who work there. While I believe that what is being reported is highly exaggerated and misleading, I am sincerely sorry that I unintentionally offended members of the Fox team during my visit. Although Simmons  interview with FoxNews.com was recorded, it will not be released.Featured image via Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2017"
GUN GRABBING PROGRESSIVES AND DUE PROCESS: Watch Trey Gowdy Grill Gov’t Thug On Due Process [Video],"We love this guy! Trey Gowdy gets it and gives a lesson to a DHS thug on due process! Yes! For progressives, the problem isn t Islam; it is the Constitution. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV)   who was elected as a supposedly pro-gun moderate   is remarkably frank:Appearing on Morning Joe to discuss the gun control measures Democratic senators filibustered for 15 hours to advance, Senator Manchin said,  Due process is what s killing us right now. Due process is killing us. If only we lived in a dictatorship with no limit on government power, everything would be fine (never mind that the FBI dropped the ball on the Omar Mateen case). At least it would be fine for Joe Manchin.Manchin gibbered incoherently that Mateen was on a terrorist watch list. Not at the time of the massacre he wasn t. The FBI investigated him twice due to all the red flags he was waving, but he was effectively cleared.A gun shop warned the FBI about Mateen prior to Orlando. But the agency didn t listen (now it has no comment).But if we just sacrifice our most basic liberties, boobs like Manchin will somehow keep us safe.It isn t just the Second Amendment that our progressive rulers want to use Islamic terror attacks as a pretext to destroy. They aren t fond of the Fifth or Fourteenth either. Both have due process clauses. As even liberal Slate recognizes,If the government can revoke your right to access firearms simply because it has decided to place you on a secret, notoriously inaccurate list, it could presumably restrict your other rights in a similar manner. You could be forbidden from advocating for causes you believe in, or associating with like-minded activists; your right against intrusive, unreasonable searches could be suspended. And you would have no recourse: The government could simply declare that, as a name on a covert list, you are owed no due process at all.That is, you have no rights at all.Discarding the Constitution isn t enough for Vox editor Emmett Rensin; he wants to abolish private property in the name of disarming law-abiding citizens: This presents a catch-22 for leftists. If they need to confiscate all of our property in order to take our guns, how will they prevent us from using guns to defend our property?Let s send progressives back to 2015 so that Trey Gowdy can give them a lesson in due process.",Government News,"Jun 17, 2016"
 Ruth Bader Ginsburg Rebukes Trump In Defense Of The Free Press,"One of the most revered Supreme Court Justices in American history just hammered Donald Trump for attacking the free press without even mentioning his name.Last week, Trump accused the media of treason by calling them the  enemy of the American people.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017His tweet drew widespread condemnation, but that didn t stop him from continuing the attack in other tweets in which he repeatedly referred to the media as  fake news  for doing accurately reporting on him and his chaotic administration.Don t believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2017Trump s assault on the free press is an assault on the Constitution. Trump apparently lied when he swore to defend it during his inauguration ceremony.But Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been defending the Constitution her whole life and she has spent the last 24 years doing so from the Supreme Court bench.During an interview with the BBC, Ginsberg stood up to Trump without mentioning him by name and defended the free press while explaining why the American people need a free press. I read the Washington Post and the New York Times every day, and I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the truth,  she said, clearly rebuking Trump s claim that the media is lying about him.Then she pointed out that the free press was instrumental in busting the Watergate scandal wide open, which resulted in Nixon s resignation. Think of what the press has done in the United States,  Ginsberg said.  That story might never have come out if we didn t have the free press that we do. Indeed, if Trump had his way the press would act as his own propaganda machine. The press would only tell the American people what he wants them to tell them. America would be like Russia or North Korea, where the press is under the control of dictators.And that s why the free press should be defended more than ever against Trump and his authoritarian agenda.The American people need a free press that will hold Trump accountable, not one that serves as his cheerleading squad.Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images",News,"February 23, 2017"
WOW! BERKELEY MAYOR Who Allegedly Told Police To “Stand Down” Is Part Of Antifa Terrorist Facebook Group,"Americans were stunned when they were told the police officers were allegedly told to  stand down  and allow violent Antifa and Democrat rioters to attack students who came to hear schedule speaker and gay conservative Milo Yiannopolous at Berkeley College in February. It turns out that the mayor who was accused of telling the police to stand down may have had a motive for allowing conservatives to be threatened and physically harmed. Here s the description of BAMN from their Facebook page: BAMN   Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means NecessaryWait, WHAT!?

BAMN is perhaps best known, however, for a 2016 incident in which they showed up to a rally held by the white-nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party outside the California state capitol building in Sacramento. The militant group was confrontational with the white-nationalists within minutes of arrival, and ten people were stabbed and hospitalized in a bloody fight. Police have verified through videos taken by members of the group, news organizations, and bystanders, that BAMN initiated the violence. Falarco was caught on camera at the event repeatedly punching a man in the stomach and throwing him to the ground.Arreguin, a far-left liberal, made headlines in February for his tweets prior to BAMN organizing a riot to prevent right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the city s University of California campus. Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn t welcome in our community,  Arreguin had tweeted.The mayor also referred to Yiannopoulos as a  white supremacist,  and was forced to issue an  apology. I consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful. But I regret and apologize for the white national label,  Arreguin tweeted.Hours after his tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to listen to Yiannopoulos speak were under a violent attack. People were assaulted with pipes, a generator-powered spotlight was firebombed, and looters destroyed several businesses in the area including a Starbucks.The rioters smashed windows, spray painted violent messages all over the area   including  Kill Trump    and began committing arsons. It was estimated that the rioters caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK Student Union, and $400,000 to $500,000 in damage to the area surrounding the university.It was immediately alleged that the mayor had ordered the police to stand down and allow the violence and destruction.Arreguin denied the accusations, saying that the police strategy was ordered by the department, not him.  They did an excellent job in preventing further risk to safety,  he added.It was alleged by journalist and author Mike Cernovich, who broke the Susan Rice scandal as well as impending Syria strikes, that the FBI was investigating Arreguin role in the stand down.Civil Rights section of FBI has opened an investigation into mayor @JesseArreguin, for inciting riots and ordering to police to stand down. pic.twitter.com/uy5EbgcvSm  Mike Cernovich   (@Cernovich) February 2, 2017Last weekend Antifa showed up to shut down the free speech of Trump supporters who were rallying in Berkeley, CA and were surprised by the number of pro-Trump patriots who weren t going to sit back and allow themselves to be beaten.Watch these two stunning interviews, where police officers almost admit to this liberal reporter that they ve been told to stand down:I tell a police officer I've been seeing people get beat up all day and they haven't been around.

That s the question on everyone s mind as the beleaguered Press Secretary walked up to the podium and showed off his upside down American flag pin.Flying an upside down American flag is officially considered a  sign of distress  and the United States flag code says it should only be done  in instances of extreme danger to life or property.

 BREAKING: DOJ To Seek Death Penalty For Charleston Church Shooter,"Almost a year ago, a deranged white supremacist went into an historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina and killed nine people, including the pastor who was also a state senator. To make things worse, the gunman, Dylann Roof, sat with the parishioners at their Wednesday night Bible study and worshipped with them after they welcomed him into their midst. Then, he went on a bloody massacre after expressing that racist hatred was the reason for his carrying out the crime.Now, nearly a year later, federal prosecutors are looking to seek the death penalty against Roof for his deadly rampage. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that her review of Roof s crimes was  rigorous  before she made the decision to attempt to have him executed. Lynch went on to say that  the nature of the alleged crime and the resulting harm compelled this decision. Authorities say that the following factors make the case eligible for the ultimate punishment:The victims  families were informed of the decision to move forward with the death penalty on the federal charges via a conference call. Steve Schmutz, who is the legal representative of three of those families, says of the decision: The families will support this decision. Really, I think the families have mixed emotions about the death penalty. But if it s ever going to be given, this case certainly calls for it. He is right, of course. Prior to going on his killing spree, Roof wrote a long, hate-filled, rambling manifesto that is arguably one of the most hateful documents ever posted on the internet. There s no doubt in anyone s mind as to what he did and why.Now, personally, I am usually 100% against the death penalty. State sanctioned killing is barbaric, and there have been too many botched executions to truly support it here. Murdering a murderer makes us no better than he is, especially if it is done in an inhumane and torturous way. However, if anyone deserves it, it is this piece of shit. This guy literally murdered people due to the color of their skin, and no other reason. Further, he picked the historic Emanuel AME Church so that he could  magnify the societal impact  of his horrific crime. He knew the history of Charleston with regards to the freeing of slaves and the liberation of Black people, and he knew the history of that church.This one is difficult for me. As a liberal, I don t support the death penalty. But, as a Black woman living in South Carolina, I know the level of racism present here. This is one time I really can t say that Loretta Lynch or anyone else is wrong.Rot in hell, Dylann Roof. It s definitely where you belong.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"May 24, 2016"
 Ted Nugent Attacks Jews Who Support Gun Control By Calling Them Nazis (IMAGES),"Professional douchebag Ted Nugent took his love of guns way too far on Monday, demonstrating how conservatives really feel about Jews.Much in the way Adolf Hitler scapegoated the Jews to justify World War II and the Holocaust, Nugent scapegoated Jews to justify an extreme pro-gun agenda.On his own Facebook page, Nugent plastered several photographs of Jewish activists and politicians, and warned his followers to memorize who they are and gave them marching orders to give them hell and shut them down. Know these punks,  Nugent wrote.  They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us the basic human right to self defense & to KEEP & BEAR ARMS while many of them have tax paid hired ARMED security! Know them well.

They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us the basic human right to self defense  Posted by Ted Nugent on Monday, February 8, 2016In a comment below his own post, Nugent wrote,  NEVER AGAIN  in reference to the Holocaust.Conservatives often use the Holocaust as a prop in their argument to oppose gun control laws. The problem with that argument is that it assumes the minority Jewish population would have been able to stand up to the powerful German military, which included the brutal SS.When Ben Carson made the same claim last year, Politifact ripped him a new one by pointing out that the Nazis actually loosened gun laws significantly for the population, but restricted Jews from owning firearms.German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis. Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized. But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened.Second, a lack of guns was not the issue. If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have. But they didn t.In other words, the only form of gun control the Nazis really liked was keeping Jews from owning them.But even if the Jews were well-armed and willing to fight back, the fact remains that the German population supported the Nazis and Hitler had powerful military forces under his command. It is highly unlikely that the Jews could have prevented the Holocaust by themselves.Despite the facts, Nugent wrote another rant aimed at those who criticized his first post, referring to Jews who don t agree with him as  Nazis in disguise. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Just when you hope that mankind couldnt possibly get any dumber or more dishonest, superFreaks rise to the occasion .Posted by Ted Nugent on Monday, February 8, 2016Offended by Nugent s nasty words, the Anti-Defamation League blasted him and demanded the removal of the post. This is nothing short of conspiratorial anti-Semitism. Regardless of one s views on gun control, this kind of scapegoating of an entire religious group is completely unacceptable and completely divorced from reality. It should go without saying that anti-Semitism has no place in the gun control debate. You should be ashamed for promoting anti-Semitic content, and we hope that good people on both sides of the gun control debate will reject his tactics and his message. We hope you will have the good sense to remove this share immediately so that it does not spread virally across the internet. Ted Nugent talks tough about his dad, but apparently the apple fell far from the tree. Let s not forget that Nugent dodged the Vietnam war by pooping in his pants.And this isn t the first time Nugent has attacked a people that suffered through genocide. Nugent once referred to Native Americans as  unclean vermin  who don t qualify as people. And let s not forget his anthem to child rape that must drive family values Republicans wild.Also, keep in mind that Ted Cruz is Nugent s favorite Republican presidential candidate in the 2016 race. Perhaps someone should ask Cruz how he feels about what Nugent thinks about Jews who support reasonable laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. Because that s what we re really talking about here  better background checks that most Americans, including NRA members, support. Nobody in our government has suggested seizing the guns of every American. And there have certainly been no suggestions of banning certain ethnic minorities from owning firearms. This is all in the imaginations of conservatives who have used such claims to push a guns everywhere agenda that has only opened our society up to more gun deaths and mass shootings than ever before.But if anyone should have their guns taken from them, it s Ted Nugent, considering the fact that he has openly called for the assassination of President Obama and other government officials on several occasions.

 Trump Just Told The Military To Do What It Wants In The Middle East,"Is there some specific reason we have someone in the White House who s willing to let the military do what it wants in terms of strikes? On Friday, it was discovered that Trump literally granted our military commanders permission to order attacks in countries that don t have much of an American military presence very shortly after he took over the White House. This means that they can carry out strikes without first having to get approval from the White House, which supposedly has military strategists who know what s going on.The first units to carry out attacks without approval from the White House were, of course, in Yemen. Yemen is where we botched a raid that yielded absolutely nothing and resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL. While that raid didn t fall under this new authority, subsequent operations could result in similar disasters. The new authority, according to The Hill, is intended to accelerate the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (a.k.a. AQAP).Navy Captain Jeff Davis says he doesn t want to telegraph future operations in explaining how this works, but, in short,  this is part of a plan to go after a very real threat, to ensure they are defeated and denied the opportunity to plot and carry out terrorist attacks from ungoverned spaces. Like Yemen? Is Trump allowing them to just do what they want or do they still have to have solid intelligence before they strike? The reason the Yemen raid was such a disaster is because the White House didn t have solid intelligence and they didn t have a solid plan. While it sounds good to turn that authority over to military commanders in the regions we supposedly want to control, the question is, do they have the knowledge they need to succeed in any attacks they decide to carry out?The kicker here is that Trump has given this overarching authority to military commanders in areas where we don t have much of a presence, and therefore, probably don t have much in the way of the intelligence we need to make successful strikes. That means we have to be more careful. Trump doesn t want to be careful. He wants to abdicate a responsibility so he can what play golf and not think about it?It s not that our military commanders are incompetent. Far from it. The problem is letting them act on, well, pretty much anything, despite limited information.

Why did larger venues refuse to host this controversial meeting? Were they afraid to allow American citizens to voice their concerns about the false teachings of Islam in the public schools? Are Americans and American businesses going to cower over the fear of being targeted by radical Muslims for fighting back against the indoctrination of Islam?BRENTWOOD, Tenn.   School board members in Brentwood, Tennessee received an education on the public s frustrations with Islam lessons in local schools during a radio station sponsored town hall Wednesday.Criticisms of the middle school text  My World History and Geography  centered mostly on the omission of negative aspects of the Muslim religion, and the appropriateness of the materials for students in sixth and seventh grades, Brentwood Homepage reports.The event was sponsored by Supertalk Radio and held in a  tiny room  at a Holiday Inn Express, where about 70 folks   including students, parents, teachers, lawmakers, school board members, and political pundits   huddled inside. Organizers reportedly turned some people away when the room reached capacity.Sunset Middle School seventh-grader Avery Noe pointed out during the meeting that lessons  exclude jihadist from Islam  and questioned why negative aspects of the religion aren t covered.Stewart County middle school teacher Kyle Mallory said teachers cover the materials they re given, focusing on what s expected on standardized tests, and asserted the issue with biased lessons on Islam stem from the state s textbook selection process. Mallory teaches in a different school district that rejected the  My World History and Geography  text, Fox 17 reports. Y all had a school board member from here come up to the textbook commission,  he said.  Nothing was done. It s not a teacher problem. We have (a state education) commissioner not doing her job, and I think the state legislature needs a no-confidence resolution. Mallory told Fox 17 the  My World History  text is  very biased, didn t tell the whole story. We need to make sure when we re teaching students in the classroom that we tell them the truth and the textbooks weren t,  Mallory said.Williamson County School Board member Beth Burgos told the Brentwood Homepage she joined the board because of textbook issues, and she backs a recent bill introduced by state Rep. Shelia Butt to postpone comparative religion courses until high school.Board member Susan Curlee believes the key to changing the way Islam is presented in schools, and to preventing unintentional indoctrination, lies with standardized tests. My biggest concern is testing,  she said.  When my daughter was in seventh grade, I was told they didn t want to teach Islam that way, but had to because 25 percent of the test was going to focus on Islam. As long as testing is the accountability metric, it could be this way. Curlee told Fox 17 the lessons her daughter learned about Islam while in Franklin Special School District last year presented a rosy picture of the religion, while glossing over important points. A lot of the things we hear about Mohammed and a lot of the warfare that was waged is very much sugar coated,  she said. My World History,  which is used by about 40 Tennessee school districts, also alleges Islam spreads peacefully, and that Christians and Muslims worship the same God. My concern is, are we going to be asking students on a test to potentially compromise their faith for the sake of a grade?  Curlee said.Tennessee state Sen. Jack Johnson, who also attended the town hall, told the Brentwood Homepage a lot of people share Curlee s concerns. I m concerned because I have three kids in Williamson County Schools,  Johnson said.  The possibility we could be advocating Islam in school and could be misrepresenting history had generated lots of calls and emails. I want to educate myself and learn more about it. Event organizers told the media they were forced to hold the town hall in the small Holiday Inn Express room because larger venues in the area refused to host the discussion.

 Twitter Users ANNIHILATE Donald Trump For Confusing 9/11 With A Convenience Store (VIDEO),"Twitter users have been annihilating Donald Trump after the Presidential candidate made a massive gaffe when speaking about 9/11 during a New York rally. The GOP frontrunner failed to remember the date, calling it 7-Eleven instead.Mt Trump made his awkward mistake during his speech in Buffalo, New York   where he is campaigning for the New York primaries. While attempting to work up the audience by invoking the spirit of the emergency services workers, living and dead, who fought to save lives during the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001   Mr Trump said: I was down there, and I watch our police and our firemen down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down and I saw the greatest people I have ever seen in action. The audience are clearly somewhat confused. The misspeak makes it sounds as if Donald Trump was down at his local 7-Eleven store, and all hell kicked off   not that he witnessed one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil in history.https://www.facebook.com/ABC7/videos/10153504430897452/ Here are some of the finest tweets in response to the Trump gaffe:Donald Trump has spoken movingly about 7-Eleven. It reminded him, he said, of the way Americans came together in 1941 after Pearl Necklace.  Damien Owens (@OwensDamien) April 19, 2016BREAKING: Trump refers to 9/11 as 7/11, fans cheer, say they're ""fed up with the establishment telling us what dates things happened on""  Rex Huppke (@RexHuppke) April 19, 2016Trump talked down 9/11 to 7/11. He knows how to make a deal!  Chris Regan (@ChrisRRegan) April 19, 2016@AP @robdelaney This is no laughing matter. I lost my dad in 7/11; he said he was running in to get a pack of smokes and I never saw him aga  wade snook (@w_snook) April 19, 2016@itvnews @vine jet fuel can't melt slurpies  Pete Hutcheon (@daddymojorisin) April 19, 2016The best bit was, this wasn t even the first mistake of the night. This rally was a real low point for the candidate   at a time when his campaign desperately needs to regain momentum.Earlier in the  same speech, Trump thanked Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan for his introductory speech   which was itself a disaster. During the thanks, Trump attributed  championship  wins to the former Jets coach which never actually happened.From overselling the  winning  capability of himself and his allies, and repeatedly invoking the painful memory of the September 11 attacks  Trump is aiming to seize the New York primary from his rivals. More than 11,000 people attended the Buffalo hockey arena to hear Trump speak   which sounds impressive until you realize Bernie Sanders attracted three times this many people to his rally in Brooklyn s Prospect Park on Sunday.There is the unmistakable whiff of decay around the Trump camp right now, as his six never-changing soundbites grow stale, and he has nothing else to offer.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 19, 2016"
SWEET SMELL OF REVENGE: Farmer Sprays Manure On Oscar Winning Actress And Film Crew During Fracking Protest On His Land [VIDEO],"GET OFF my fracking land!An irate farmer sprayed raw sewage at Oscar winning star Emma Thompson and her sister Sophie after they flouted a court injunction protecting a fracking site.The stars were filming a Great British Bake Off parody for Greenpeace when the owner of the field they trespassed on drove his muck spreader in circles around the demonstrators. A group of protesters were hit by the manure but the actresses remained dry in their tent, complete with Bake Off-inspired bunting.Police were also called and also spoke to the actresses, who climbed over a gate and set up camp on land earmarked for gas exploration in Fylde, Lancashire.Emma and Sophie, who won Celebrity Masterchef, filmed a pastiche episode of the Great British Bake Off called Frack Free Bake Off to voice their opposition to the fracking plans. But this afternoon the landowner, who leases the contested patch of land to fracking company Cuadrilla, drove his muck spreader in circles around the demonstrating group.After a couple of circles around the group, who were shouting for him to stop it, the farmer drove off.Protesters are banned from the site, near Preston, after company Cuadrilla applied for an injunction in 2014. It is not clear if the fracking company will now take civil action   but it appears unlikely. Via: UK Daily Mail ",left-news,"Apr 28, 2016"

" No, Google Is Not Cheating For Hillary Clinton (VIDEO)","For months now, Republicans and some in the Bernie Sanders camp have been looking for a smoking gun; a damning piece of evidence that proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that Hillary Clinton is cheating. The YouTube channel, SourceFed, thought they found the smoking gun, when they demonstrated what they thought was irrefutable proof that Google was in the tank for Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, SourceFed has no idea how Google works.The premise behind the conspiracy theory involves Google s predictive search or autocomplete. When users type in partial key phrases, like  Hillary Clinton cri,  other search engines, like Bing and Yahoo, list as a possible search phrase,  Hillary Clinton crimes.  Google doesn t.Here s the video:This is what I get when I type in  Hillary Clinton cri  on Google.Yahoo gives me this:Bing, this:After watching the video, I conducted my own little experiment. Surely, if Google was in the tank for Clinton, it would show up under non-predictive search results, right? For example, I typed in the words,  Hillary Clinton  in Google, and below the paid content and the standard things on top, like Wikipedia, there s a whole lot of negative stuff:Those are the listings on page one. Going deeper into the searches brings up a lot more negative than positive.Unfortunately, my experiment isn t any more scientific than SourceFed s, but others know more and they say that it s SourceFed that was manipulating the search results, not Google. Google, which should surprise few, has a more sophisticated search engine than either Bing or Yahoo. They do sort of manipulate searches, but not to influence public opinion. They don t include unfounded negative listings in their autocomplete options, no matter how many people are searching those rumors. Clinton has never been convicted or even indicted of a crime, hence it not showing up. By the same token, entering  Donald Trump la  does not bring up  Donald Trump lawsuits,  despite the fact that a whole lot of people are searching for information about his lawsuits. It does include  Donald Trump laughing,  though.Just to test that, I entered  Bill Clinton i,  because we know he was impeached, and surely, if Google were manipulating autocomplete results for Hillary, then they would certainly do it for her husband, right? Wrong:Remember that Bernie Sanders rape fantasy essay from eons ago, that absolutely no one should care about? Google doesn t care about it either:Similarly, I did a search for  Donald Trump bri,  half expecting results for his alleged bribery of two Attorneys General. Nothing:The most ridiculous part of the SourceFed allegation, though, is their assumption that people don t continue and enter all the letters and hit  enter,  which would bring up numerous rumors, conspiracy theories and allegations, including the accusations of search manipulations by Google. You d think they d at least keep themselves from looking bad in their search rankings, right? They don t.Here s what Google has to say about it: Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works. Our Autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person s name. More generally, our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms,  said the statement.Featured image via YouTube.",News,"June 11, 2016"

" Sorry, Not Sorry: Here Are Some Of The Funniest Responses To Scalia’s Death (IMAGES)","Ordinarily we would not celebrate the death of another human being, but some people are just so awful that they make us want to run into the streets and jump for joy when they finally bite the dust. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was one of those people. While the Republican Party is mourning his death, liberals aren t doing any such thing. Sure, we feel sympathy for his family because they lost a loved one, but that s where it ends.Antonin Scalia spent his career on the Supreme Court violating the rights of everyone who was not a white, Christian, Republican male. Not only did he help place George W. Bush in the White House in 2000, he also fought against women s rights, voting rights, and LGBT rights.  Justice Scalia was also a racist who believed that African-Americans are not smart enough to attend elite universities with white students.No, we are not saddened by his passing, we are relieved that he will no longer be able to inflict harm on the people of the United States. Seriously though, I hope someone did that. Doesn t seem very pro-life to me, but his decisions rarely were. HAHAHAHAHA!Best day ever! I stand with God, do you? Very few . Who is Clarence going to copy now?! OMG what s going to happen to him?! We have decided that Jesus wouldn t like that very much. Thankfully, President Obama now has the opportunity to replace Satan s spawn with a justice who actually supports the Constitution and ALL of its amendments. Republicans are going to fight like hell to keep this from happening, because they, like Scalia, do not care about this country or its citizens. And this, my friends, is why it is so important that we put our Bernie/Hillary fighting aside and vote for whomever the Democratic Party picks as our candidate.I m going to leave you with this, the truest of all the Scalia memes: All images from Facebook/ Twitter/ Instagram",News,"February 15, 2016"
 Texas Gun Nuts Open Fire On Democratic Office Of Gun Control-Supporting Senator,"The Houston Police Department and Texas Rangers are investigating after a gun nut opened fire on the office of Democratic state Senator John Whitmire a day before President Obama is scheduled to speak in Austin.Early Thursday morning around 12:30am, a shooter fired several rounds into the two-story office.  There are bullet slugs everywhere,  Whitmire said.  One lodged in a framed picture. It s pretty amazing. Whitemire, a gun control advocate, surmised that the weapon used in the attack was an AR-15 because the bullets were .223 caliber. No one was harmed in the shooting but Whitmire and his staff along with law enforcement officials are taking the incident seriously. We ll take precautions. But it s part of the job, unfortunately, in this day and time,  Whitmire said.  They are checking in this general area to see if anyone else received any gunfire. We don t know yet. I don t know yet. The targeting of Whitmire s office occurred the day before President Obama is scheduled to appear at the South by Southwest tech and music festival on Friday where he is delivered a keynote address.Upon hearing of Obama s schedule, Texas open carry gun nuts stated their desire to attend the event with their guns to hand out pro-law literature. But one of the gun nuts had a different idea for what his buddies should do. If you get a clear shot, please fire for effect!  conservative gun nut Kriss Elliot wrote on Facebook.So not only has the Texas open carry obsession resulted in violence against a Democratic office, it has resulted in gun nuts actually wanting to assassinate President Obama, and now it s much easier for them to do this because they are legally allowed to carry deadly firearms in public view.Make no mistake, these people belong in jail or at the very least an FBI watch list, but as long as Republicans control the state it will remain an exaggerated and embarrassing version of the Wild West.Featured Image: OnlyInYourState.com",News,"March 11, 2016"
 Ben Carson: Homeless Shelters Shouldn’t Be “Comfortable” Because People Might “Stay”,"If you didn t know that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was once a neurosurgeon, you would never believe he had any hint of intelligence just from the idiotic things he says.Today, Ben Carson was quoted in a New York Times interview painting an extremely solemn picture of what public housing will look like under the Trump administration. As Carson has said several ridiculous things during his own failed presidential campaign and while he was helping with Trump s campaign, this should hardly be surprising   but it will still infuriate you.Carson defended disabled and elderly people who might need public housing, and said we can t expect to do a great deal to take care of themselves.  But when it came to others who did not fall into those two categories but still needed public housing, Carson had something else to say. He said: There is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them. The Times reported:Compassion, Mr. Carson explained in an interview, means not giving people  a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say:  I ll just stay here. They will take care of me. It s safe to say that most of us have been taught a VERY different meaning of the word  compassion , and Carson s definition clearly does not fit. Carson has been traveling all over the United States to get a scope of public housing in places like Detroit and Miami. While he was in Ohio, Carson visited a facility for drug abusers and reportedly said: We are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves. Carson s attitude toward public housing is disgraceful, and ABC s Sunny Hostin was right to slam him immediately:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2017"

I think there is a vastly different model when it comes to government and what should be expected, and that s on both sides. I think we have a respect for the press when it comes to the government. That is something you can t ban an entity from,  Spicer said. But now the Trump administration is banning media from government functions. . Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller made it clear that Trump s actions are absolute and  will not be questioned  after judges killed The Donald s Muslim ban.

Fox News, Bill O Reilly, and Watters disrespected and insulted the Asian-American community that day, and they have still not issued an apology despite Asian-American organizations raining hell on them with statement after statement condemning the segment.So Selvig treated Watters the same way.Selvig approached Watters on the street and gave him a hug before saying  hello  to him using a racist Asian accent. Pretty good, right?  Selvig asked Watters.  It s racist like you like. A confused Watters then realizes what s going on and tries to run away like a coward. But Selvig continues mocking him by pitching future segments Watters should consider for his next  man-on-the-streets  bit. Just a bunch of black people eating fried chicken?  Selvig suggests.  How about just Mexicans eating tacos? Selvig then suggests a segment on gay people, but then remembers that Watters already did that and shows some footage of it. Oh just like, call all Muslims terrorists,  Selvig continues before nixing the idea because  I guess you guys already do. Selvig tells Watters that he ll leave him alone if he plugs his movie  Undecided.  When Watters avoids doing so, Selvig takes matters into his own hands and declares that it s endorsed by Fox News.Here s the video via Facebook:Jesse Watters and Fox News should think twice before doing such a segment ever again. In fact, they should just not do these kinds of segments at all. But if they do, perhaps comedians from all over can approach Watters on the streets and mock him.

 Muslim Who Told FBI About Orlando Shooter Has Powerful Message For Trump,"After the Orlando Massacre we ve once again seen Republicans   led by Donald Trump   blame all Muslims for the action of one person or group of people. They insist, while not citing any actual evidence, that Muslims in America are not helping law enforcement to prevent terrorists in their midst, who are operating in their communities.It isn t true, and now someone is speaking out. Mohammed A. Malik actually flagged Orlando shooter Omar Mateen to the FBI, and after hearing Trump slander him and fellow Muslims, he s had enough.In an essay for the Washington Post, Malik told his story first hand:Donald Trump believes American Muslims are hiding something.  They know what s going on. They know that [Omar Mateen] was bad,  he said after the Orlando massacre.  They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.   But you know what? They didn t turn them in. And you know what? We had death and destruction. This is a common idea in the United States. It s also a lie. First, Muslims like me can t see into the hearts of other worshipers. (Do you know the hidden depths of everyone in your community?) Second, Trump is wrong that we don t speak up when we re able.Malik goes on to explain that after learning that Mateen had been watching videos put out by terrorist propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki,  I contacted the FBI again to let them know that Omar had been watching Awlaki s tapes. He hadn t committed any acts of violence and wasn t planning any, as far as I knew. And I thought he probably wouldn t, because he didn t fit the profile: He already had a second wife and a son. But it was something agents should keep their eyes on. Why did he do this?I had told the FBI about Omar because my community, and Muslims generally, have nothing to hide. I love this country, like most Muslims that I know. I don t agree with every government policy (I think there s too much money in politics, for instance), but I m proud to be an American.He concludes with a direct message for the Republican nominee for President of the United States:  Trump s assertions about our community   that we have the ability to help our country but have simply declined to do so   are tragic, ugly and wrong.

The numbers are confusing, but $3 trillion whatever we can afford every year, but we so exceed that. We have exceeded it for so long. We re already paying for things we can t afford. And these people just want to lap more and more on top of it.Via: Rush Limbaugh",politics,"Oct 14, 2015"
MUSLIM MAYOR OF LONDON TO U.S.- Immigrants Shouldn’t Have To Assimilate,"Many Americans are suspicious of he Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has strong ties to muslim extremists and was a strong supporter of Hillary.Khan has been on a Hillary supporting tour here in the United States and he is using that platform to let us know that he doesn t feel that immigrants should assimilate.Mr. Khan insists:  One of the lessons from around the world is that a laissez-faire or hands-off approach to social integration doesn t work. We need rules, institutions, and support to enable people to integrate into cohesive communities and for the avoidance of doubt, I don t mean assimilation, I mean integration, and there s a difference. People shouldn t have to drop their cultures and traditions when they arrive in our cities and countries .Coming from the muslim mayor who has let London go to pot with the epidemic of currently suffering from Muslim ghettoisation, horrific employment rates for Muslim women, an internal debate surrounding the banning of the burka, and ongoing issues such as female genital mutilation, anti-Semitism, and homophobia within Muslim communities.It s ironic that a man that has erased many freedoms by way of new  laws  such as British women not being allowed to travel over a certain distance from their addresses alone, and the banning of any  sexually geared  ads on the side of public transportation, i.e. models promoting products, has the nerve to state that we should essentially allow muslims to come her and continue applying Sharia Law when their very  tradition  violates our Constitution.Mr. Khan needs to go back to London with his anti-freedom rhetoric. Americans will never allow immigrants to come here and try to impose any traditions that may be harmful to our citizens, nor will we ever allow the nationwide implementation of their archaic  law.

HANNITY TEARS IT UP IN HIS BEST EVER RANT: ‘Hillary Clinton and Her Husband Sold Out America to the Russians!’ [Video],"Sean Hannity was on fire with his opening comments on the Clinton-Uranium One deal bombshell last night. He ripped the Clintons and called on Trump s intelligence and law officials to investigate the scandal. It s a classic Hannity rant:  After President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration   they were telling anyone who would listen,  Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy  Hannity mocked.  Well if that s the case, why when they have mountains of evidence that we will reveal tonight of Russian bribery going back to 2009, why then would the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20% of America s uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians? Tonight, with this new evidence, what we have discovered is that the evidence against the Clintons is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible,  Hannity continued.  Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton created a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child   giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium. IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE CLINTON-URANIUM ONE BOMBSHELL:Yesterday, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange sent a cryptic tweet that contained a series of number and letters. Someone out there knows what that code means, and they are very likely shaking in their boots today.4767 5774 6a7a 4d6c 6330 666b 314a 3453 0000 0907 84b4 f787 7616 86f7 a737 5707 5736  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 15, 2017On another front, two writers from separate publications were set to publish what Sean Hannity was calling a  huge bombshell  story that was due to break today.Last night on Fox News  Hannity show, Sean Hannity warned that a huge bombshell would be breaking today. Sean told his audience that Circa News Sara Carter and The Hill s John Solomon have HUGE BREAKING NEWS. Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017",Government News,"Oct 18, 2017"
SCRUBBED CLEAN? HILLARY CLINTON TO FINALLY TURN OVER SERVER TO FBI,"I appears that Hillary Clinton is really in a big mess with this e-mail scandal. She could have just turned the server over and dealt with this at the beginning but she s made this into a HUGE mess. Her trustworthiness is about as low as it gets as her opponent gains points in the polls. Shades of 2008 with Barack Obama? Hillary Clinton relented Tuesday to months of demands she relinquish the personal email server she used while secretary of state, directing the device be given to the Justice Department.The decision advances the investigation into the Democratic presidential front-runner s use of a private email account as the nation s top diplomat, and whether classified information was improperly sent via and stored on the home-brew email server she ran from her house in suburban New York City.Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said she has  pledged to cooperate with the government s security inquiry, and if there are more questions, we will continue to address them. It s not clear if the device will yield any information   Clinton s attorney said in March that no emails from the main personal address she used while secretary of state still  reside on the server or on back-up systems associated with the server. Clinton had to this point refused demands from Republican critics to turn over the server to a third party, with attorney David Kendall telling the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that  there is no basis to support the proposed third-party review of the server. Republicans jumped on Tuesday s decision to change course, as well as the additional disclosure that two emails that traversed Clinton s personal system were subsequently given one of the government s highest classification ratings. All this means is that Hillary Clinton, in the face of FBI scrutiny, has decided she has run out of options,  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.  She knows she did something wrong and has run out of ways to cover it up. Federal investigators have begun looking into the security of Clintons  email setup amid concerns from the inspector general for the intelligence community that classified information may have passed through the system.There is no evidence she used encryption to shield the emails or her personal server from foreign intelligence services or other potentially prying eyes. Kendall has said previously that Clinton is  actively cooperating  with the FBI inquiry.In March, Clinton said she exchanged about 60,000 emails in her four years in the Obama administration, about half of which were personal and were discarded. She turned over the other half to the State Department in last December.The department is reviewing those emails and has begun the process of releasing them to the public. As she has said, it is her hope that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to release to the public, and that the release will be as timely and transparent as possible,  Merrill said Tuesday.Also Tuesday, Kendall gave to the Justice Department three thumb drives containing copies of work-related emails sent to and from her personal email addresses via her private server.Via: Yahoo",Government News,"Aug 12, 2015"

BLACK WOMAN IN CHARLESTON WARNS “There’s gonna be a race war against ‘Cracka’s'”,"All the progress that s been made with race relations in America since the civil rights era has been ignored by so many angry blacks who ve bought into the carefully orchestrated Obama, Sharpton and Holder race war funded by their friend, George Soros. Since the liberal mainstream media wants to use the horrific massacre in Charleston to attack conservatives, disparage white people and act as if Dylann Roof s actions represent a normalcy, I thought it only fair to bring up the case of a black woman from Charleston, Sista Solove, who this week essentially asserted that white supremacy is leading us towards a race war against  crackas. She made the statement on Wednesday while speaking with Breitbart Texas editor Brandon Darby outside the Mother Emmanuel American Methodist Church in Charleston.When he asked her what she thinks will ultimately result from Roof s actions, she replied,  The real question is   if it were the other way around, what would that be? https://youtu.be/_o-rzGRSu8sIf a black person   if a nigga killed nine crackas, he would be dead. We wouldn t even be talking about his raggedy ass. Okay. But this cracka is,  Oh, he s mentally ill. Oh, ya know, pray for him. Oh, they ve got support systems for him.No, it s an agenda, and there s going to be a race war because it continues to happen. You cannot go pray. You can t be a child at a playground. You can t wear a hoodie with Skittles. You can t be black.What s a good nigga supposed to do, Massa? What s a good nigga supposed to do not to get shot? That s a good question, ain t it?The reason Roof happens to be alive to this day is because he complied with police orders and did not resist arrest. This places him in stark contrast to the likes of, say, Mike Brown and Eric Garner.The comment about  a child at a playground  referred to 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who died in an unfortunate incident after a bystander reported  a male sitting on a swing and pointing a gun at people.  The gun turned out to be fake, though according to reports, Rice reached for it when the cops told him to put his hands up.And as for the comment about how  you can t wear a hoodie with Skittles,  that referred to Trayvon Martin, who was justifiably shot by George Zimmerman after he attacked the guy for no legitimate reason whatsoever.Anyway. Sista Solove then delivered what Breitbart contributor Lee Stranahan accurately described as  the academic Marxist message of  white privilege  that underscores the current Black Lives Matter movement :It s called white privilege. You don t understand where our anger comes from. No one gets it. Our history comes from our family telling us,  Oh, you can t be black. Don t do this, don t go to that fountain, don t do this  and we re still dealing with this shit. What are we going to do with the anger? What are we going to do with the anger?

 Clinton Extends Olive Branch To Sanders: We Will Work Together On Party Platform,"With the Democratic nomination wrapping up in Hillary Clinton s favor, the question remains what role Senator Bernie Sanders will play heading into the convention in Philadelphia. Trailing in the delegate support and popular vote support, Sanders undoubtedly has mastered a great chunk of clout that the Democrats will need to tap into if they hope to beat Donald Trump or long-shot candidate Ted Cruz.While the Sanders campaign has remained unwavering in their determination to win California, a power house in delegates and popular voters, they have accepted their path to the nomination is almost all but impossible. However, the campaign has found a way to make their lasting presence within the Democratic Party: the national platform.And Hillary Clinton, who is having to fight to pick up Sanders supporters, is prepared to offer an olive branch of solidarity to work together. Appearing on CNN with Jake Tapper, the frontrunner said she welcomes working with Sanders to implement a progressive platform: I certainly look forward to working with Sen. Sanders in the lead-up to the convention  in the lead-up to the platform that will represent the Democratic Party. It will be a progressive platform. I ve run on a progressive agenda. I really welcome his ideas and his passion and commitment, because the most important thing is winning in November. Sanders has called on the Democratic Party to implement open-primaries, automatic voter registration, and a 50-state strategy to garner as many votes as possible. Clinton has seemingly embraced some of these positions, and especially loved when Sanders told reporters his main priority in November is to make sure Donald Trump would not become President of the United States:There is no more important goal, and I was pleased when Sen. Sanders said the other day he s going to work tirelessly to make sure that Donald Trump was not president, and I really welcome that because that has to be our primary objective.As Clinton heads into the general, she will need to court Sanders  most ardent supporters. Extending an olive branch to work with Sanders is a smart move on Clinton s part, and will ensure a unified party.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2016"
COMMUNIST VIETNAMESE LEADER THANKS U.S. Anti-War Activists For Helping With Their Victory Only Days Before Obama’s Visit,"Obama s historic Embracing the Communists Tour wouldn t be complete without a stop in Vietnam All on the American taxpayers dime, of course In the weeks leading up to Memorial Day and President Barack Obama s scheduled trip to Vietnam, a prominent Vietcong communist leader privately thanked American anti-war activists for helping defeat the U.S.-allied government in Vietnam in the 1970s, saying protest demonstrations throughout the United States were  extremely important in contributing to Vietnam s victory. For Vietnamese guerrilla leader Madam Nguyen Thi Binh, who sent the private letter from Hanoi dated April 20,  victory  meant the communist takeover of South Vietnam. The letter addressed veteran American anti-war activists who gathered in Washington, D.C., at a May 3 reunion of radical  May Day  anti-war leaders.The Daily Caller News Foundation obtained a copy of the letter at the meeting.Binh, now age 90, originally served as the highest ranking Vietnamese delegate to the Paris Peace Talks that imposed a ceasefire in the country in 1973.The  Vietcong  was a ragtag group of communist guerrillas who were allied with the official communist government in North Vietnam. The country was cut in two in 1954, with the south seeking to build a democratic state allied to the West.Binh s frank admission highlights a secret side of the communist s effective lobbying influence in the United States. Rather than live in the southern part of the country, which for decades she represented as a diplomat, it appears after the war Binh was living in Hanoi, the original capital of North Vietnam.In her letter, she extolled the American anti-war movement, saying it was  a key component  that advanced the communist takeover of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people have great appreciation for the peace and antiwar movements in the United States and view those movements  contribution as important in shortening the war,  she wrote and which was read to an assembled group of  May Day  anti-war activists in Washington, D.C.The  May Day tribe  consisted of thousands of radical anti-war protesters bent on shutting down Washington, D.C., in May 1971 through three days of massive civil disobedience. More than 12,000 protesters were arrested, for filling the streets to block feds from getting to work.The Nixon administration was so fearful of violence against federal employees, it deployed 5,000 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division and thousands more from the Marine Corps barracks to protect the 14th Street Bridge, a major thoroughfare into the nation s capital from Virginia.The protesters rallying cry was,  if the government won t stop the war, we ll stop the government. The war temporarily ended in 1973 when the Paris Peace Treaty was signed that imposed a ceasefire on all parties.That ceasefire was abruptly broken in 1975, however, when the North Vietnamese forces launched a surprise  Spring Offensive. Leading the offensive were hundreds of T-54 and T-55 heavy Russian tanks that left secret sanctuaries in neighboring Cambodia and flooded into South Vietnam. Regular North Vietnamese troops spearheaded the offensive, along with guerrillas tied to the Vietcong, which also called themselves the National Liberation Front of Vietnam.By the time the Russian tanks were about to drive into Saigon, a liberal Congress filled with anti-war lawmakers already had hamstrung their South Vietnamese allies. Congress cut military aid to Saigon by 50 percent and handcuffed the South Vietnamese military facing the communist onslaught by barring any U.S. air support or other meaningful military assistance to the government.The offensive was relatively quick, trapping hundreds of thousands of pro-American Vietnamese troops and millions of civilians who had trusted Washington and openly supported the United States.The lasting images of those dark, chaotic days were captured by American news networks, which showed the panic in the capital city.Harrowing pictures depicted U.S. helicopters frantically trying to ferry thousands of panic-stricken Vietnamese citizens and U.S. officials off the roof of the American Embassy. The videos depicted Vietnamese clinging from helicopters in a desperate effort to escape the onrushing communist army.The defeat ultimately triggered an international humanitarian crisis where at least 800,000 Vietnamese  boat people  fled their communist conquerors. Many bravely undertook perilous journeys in small boats across the Gulf of Thailand to escape the new communist warlords. An unknown number of refugees drowned in the exodus.After the communists defeated the South Vietnamese army, more than 1 million South Vietnamese citizens who had supported the United States were left behind and imprisoned in  re-education camps.  About 100,000 faced summary execution by the communist victors.Bill Cowan, who was a Purple Heart Marine platoon leader in Vietnam, told TheDCNF that U.S. troops were demoralized when the U.S. media only highlighted anti-war protesters and not the heroism of many of the Vietnamese who were trying to keep their country free. The media fueled the anti-war movement, empowering the protestors, the North Vietnamese, and the Vietcong,  he told TheDCNF. It was rare to have a  good news  story about what was happening there,  Cowan said. I recall a reporter coming to interview me at the village I was living at and apologizing after she was done by saying,  You know, this story will probably never see the light of day. My editors will quash it because it has too many good things in here about what you guys are doing.  Cowan told TheDCNF.Fred Rustmann, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was deployed in Vietnam for two years and later assigned to cover the Paris Peace Talks where Binh was the chief Vietcong delegate, called her  a great propagandist. She was really the propaganda arm of the Vietcong. And she was very effective. She was living in a villa in Paris in the southern suburbs, which was a very communist, socialist neighborhood,  Rustmann told TheDCNF in an interview. He said ironically Binh spent more time in Paris than in Vietnam.In Paris,  she was regularly interviewing with leftist news organization. She had these leftist kids and try to influence them. I believe she met several times with Jane Fonda. Binh actually recalled in her latest letter many meetings she had with American anti-war activists. She wrote,  The first time I met representatives of the American anti-war movement was at a week-long conference held in Bratislava in 1967, with the attendees of about forty Americans. Before parting, we were shaking hands, holding hands,  she recalled in her letter, adding,  During the war years, I also met many other Americans in different places organized by U.S. citizen groups opposed to the war. Obama visited Vietnam last week for a three-day trip, and hailed its communist leadership and downplayed the human rights problems that persist.Hours before Air Force One touched down, Vietnam had scheduled national  elections  for its one-party National Assembly. Reminiscent of previous old communist regimes from the Soviet Union days, the state-run press reported that 98.77 percent of the public  voted  in the election.Only one sentence in Obama s main speech to the Vietnamese public made any reference to human rights problems in the country.Vietnamese government officials also blocked dissidents from meeting with Obama or his advisers when the American delegation arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said it shows the meeting was  the source of significant discomfort  for Vietnam s rulers. Via: Daily Caller",politics,"May 30, 2016"
 Bill Maher Explains How Every Republican Can Change — Except On This One Issue (VIDEO),"During the New Rules segment of Real Time with Bill Maher, Maher gave a hilarious analysis of Republican s hypocrisy, how they flip-flop only when it happens to them, and what that means for the planet.Maher tosses off a litany of examples of individual Republicans who have completely changed their minds about issues   as soon as those issues found their ways into their lives. Maher says: It explains why John McCain supports every form of war ever invented and some he just fantasizes about in the shower but torture? No, because he was tortured by Sarah Palin. It explains why Ronald Reagan suddenly cared about AIDS only after it struck his friend Rock Hudson. And why Nancy Reagan got religion on stem cell research after Ronnie got Alzheimer s. And it explains why Newt Gingrich gave up hunting after he married an owl. That s good news for people on the right side of history already. Most Republican politicians eventually catch up with the rest of class on most issues. It may take a long time and a lot of work but public opinion shifts and they must shift along with it.The problem is if having a personal stake in the matter is the spark that helps create that shift, issues that are more recondite in nature can be almost impossible for them to change their minds on. Issues like climate change just won t become a major issue for most Republicans.Maher makes fun of this, hoping that the gods of irony hit Republicans with problems caused by environmental destruction. Let Rush Limbaugh be attacked by a swarm of dying bees and the Koch brothers be swallowed up by a fracking-induced earthquake. And to slap the global warming denial out of Marco Rubio whose own state of Florida is one of the most likely places to be inundated by rising oceans his own home must get flooded and Marco must be swept out to sea and washed up all the way back to Cuba, where we will find out that Marco Rubio is really Elian Gonzalez.

 Crowd Erupts In Boos When Military Mom Asks Pence About Trump’s Khan Statements,"A Mike Pence rally in Nevada turned ugly when a military mom asked the vice presidential candidate about Donald Trump s recent statements regarding Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala. Rally goers viciously booed her and demanded to know why she was even there in the first place.The woman, who was later identified as identified as Catherine Byrne. began by explaining that her son is serving in the Air Force. Of course, the crowd cheered enthusiastically. But when she continued, their mood quickly did an about face: Time and time again, [Donald] Trump has disrespected our nation s armed forces and veterans. And his disrespect for Mr. Khan  That was as far as she got before the crowd became vicious, booing her so fiercely that they drowned out her words. Why are you here?  one woman screamed angrily. But Byrne continued to speak You ve got a son in the military, how do you tolerate this disrespect? Pence finally stepped in after about 10 seconds and began to hush the crowd. That s OK,  he said. Pence then reiterated what he and said when he was confronted by protesters in Ohio last week: That s what freedom looks like, and that s what freedom sounds like. Pence then praised Capt. Humayun Khan and his family. Khan was killed in Iraq while serving in the United States military. His parents made headlines when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention and blasted Trump for his anti-Muslim rhetoric. The Republican nominee responded to Khizr Khan s criticism of his bigoted policies by attack them. Capt. Khan is an American hero and we honor him and honor his family,  he said.  The story of Capt. Khan is an incredibly inspiring story. But in the next breath, Pence defended Trump. I have never been around someone more devoted to the armed forces of this country,  Pence said of Trump.  There is no one more devoted to the veterans in this country. One of the people booing Byrne was Denise Martinez. She said that she admired how Pence had dealt with the tense situation. I thought he handled it really, really well,  she said.  Looking back, I think I would ve taken the high road. He handled it the right way, the way I wish Trump would have,  she added.Barbara Weisenthal was another woman who was booing.

HILLARY Calls On CRANKY SOCIALIST She Stole Election From To Sway Free Sh*t Voters [VIDEO],"Poor Bernie. He s been a public servant his whole life and what does he have to show for it? After Hillary stole the election from him, he still agreed to endorse her. Suddenly, Bernie had enough money to buy 3rd home on beautiful Lake Champlain, where the one-percenters Bernie rails against call home. What s in it for Bernie now? Why, after months of being silent, is he hitting the campaign trail for Hillary? Could he and his lovely wife be in the market for a 4th home? Perhaps he s vying a cabinet position? What about Secretary of Free Sh*t For Everyone? Who better for such a position than the self-described Socialist who rails against the 1%, while simultaneously enjoying the lifestyle of the rich and famous. Ahh the hypocrisy of the Left. There s nothing quite like it Hillary Clinton, campaigning here Wednesday with Sen. Bernie Sanders, worked to sway millennial voters by promoting a plan to make public college tuition-free for working families.In a University of New Hampshire gym packed with students, Clinton sought to connect with those facing sometimes insurmountable college debt. Clinton said that when she graduated from college herself, she repaid her loans as a percentage of her income, which allowed her to take a low-paying public service job with the Children s Defense Fund. I could never have done that if I had the kind of interest rates a lot of people are facing,  she told a crowd estimated at 1,200.  We are going to fix it. This is wrong. Clinton said when she taught law in Arkansas she met many students who scraped together money for tuition but were sidelined by financial hardships, including broken-down cars or child-care problems.Clinton noted that New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt and the second-highest average debt per student. She said she aims to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 per year, to make community college free, and to help students refinance their college debt. When you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars,  she said.  USA TodayYeah because giving people free sh*t that would normally cost tens of thousands and in some cases even hundreds of thousands of dollars to people who are unwilling to sacrifice and work hard to pay off their debt obligations, while asking hard-working Americans who can barely make their own ends meet, to pick up the students  tab is a great idea. That ought to go over real well with the working Americans you re asking to pay for your ridiculous vote getting scheme Hillary For anyone who has the stomach, here is their rally together in its entirety: ",politics,"Sep 29, 2016"
KASICH WANTS AMNESTY FOR ILLEGALS BUT A GRIEVING MOTHER RESPONDS: “Visit the grave of my murdered child”,"The many, many murders and rapes of American citizens at the hands of people who re here illegally is sickening. Illegal alien criminals are released or deported just to come back and commit another crime. Our elected leaders have done a poor job of protecting the legal citizens of this country BUT they re welcoming in and expecting us to pay for illegals with our tax dollars. We have a perfect example of that in Gov. John Kasich who s stated that he would give amnesty to the millions of illegals within 100 days of the beginning of his presidency. Unreal! A mother of a son who was killed by an illegal gives her take on this proposal by Kasich: It s all so senseless,  Maureen Maloney said of the death of countless Americans at the hands of illegal aliens.Maloney s 23 year-old son Matthew was hit by a repeat-offending illegal alien drunk driver. Although Matthew survived the initial crash, he died as he was subsequently dragged a quarter of a mile caught in the wheel well of the illegal alien s pick up truck  as the alien sought to flee the crime scene.  Witnesses who saw [Matthew] pinned screaming under the truck ran out and pounded on the vehicle, crying out to the driver who kept going '[Matthew] was alive for a good portion of it,  wrote one report from the time. NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR STOLEN LIVES He wanted to be a police officer,  Maloney said of her young son, who was voted  most dependable  by his high school senior class.  He had taken the civil service exam  He liked to help people and do good. He was just a law-abiding person,  she said quietly. The person who killed him should not have been in this country,  Maloney explained, noting that Matthew s killer  had assaulted police officers, he had assaulted paramedics, multiple drunk drivings, domestic violence and each time he had a run in with the police, he d go to court, pay his fine and be let go,  Maloney said. Somebody needs to start putting American lives first.  Somebody has to take care of the people that are in this country legally,  Maloney declared.

Nicholas Guaman, 34, of Milford, pleaded not guilty to vehicular homicide, driving under the influence of alcohol, leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury and death, possession of an open container, failing to stop for police, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, failure to yield at a stop sign, wanton or reckless conduct creating risk to a child, and resisting arrest. Mr. Guaman, a native of Ecuador, is being investigated by federal immigration officials. He was held on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer and bail was set at $100,000, according to court officials. Police say Mr. Guaman was drunk when he ran a stop sign about 7:45 p.m. Saturday night and struck the motorcycle driven by Matthew Denice, 23, of Milford. Witnesses told police Mr. Denice was stuck in the wheel well of Mr. Guaman s pickup truck and was dragged about a quarter of a mile, despite people chasing the truck and banging on the sides screaming at the driver to stop. Mr. Denice was declared dead at Milford Regional Medical Center. Mr. Guaman s 6-year-old son, who was in the truck, was not injured. Authorities said Mr. Guaman is in the country illegally and could face deportation. During Mr. Guaman s arraignment, a prosecutor said that after Mr. Guaman s truck dragged Mr. Denice for more than a quarter of a mile, Mr. Guaman made a turn and drove onto a sidewalk. At that point, Mr. Denice was dislodged from the truck. Mr. Guaman then backed up over Mr. Denice and drove off, prosecutors said. He was stopped by Milford police a short time later. Mr. Guaman s lawyer, Craig Tavares, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  We have two major issues here,  Mr. Denice s mother, Maureen Maloney, told reporters.  The drinking and driving, and illegals driving without a license. I m not against people coming to this country, it s a wonderful country, but do it the right way and abide by the laws once you re here.  Pablo Guaman, who owns the truck Nicholas Guaman was driving, was charged with allowing an unlicensed driver to drive a motor vehicle. Authorities were unsure whether the two are related.Via: Telegram",politics,"Mar 15, 2016"

BREAKING: President Trump Makes FBI Pick One Day Before Comey Testimony [Video],"President Trump has nominated Christopher Wray to be the new director of the FBI. The president announced the pick in a tweet Wednesday:  I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow. #BREAKING  @POTUS nominates Christopher Wray for @FBI Director. #AmericaFirst   #MAGA pic.twitter.com/7reLeV2ZE8  Boston Bobblehead (@DBloom451) June 7, 2017This comes one month after President Trump fired James Comey:  While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,  Trump said in a letter to Comey.  It is essential that we find new leadership for the F.B.I. that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission. You are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately. Trump interviewed a slew of candidates for the position, including FBI director Andrew McCabe, former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, former FBI official Richard McFeely and John Pistole before settling on Wray.The interesting thing about the pick is that this was Trump s pick. This is also a brilliant move from the president to nominate a pick for FBI Director one day before Comey testifies.Christopher Wray was the lawyer for Chris Christie in the Bridgegate Investigation. The left will probably go bonkers over that fun fact.Here s a little more on Wray:Wray was nominated by President George W. Bush as assistant attorney general in charge of the Criminal Division, according to the U.S. Department of Justice website. He held that job until 2005.Christopher Wray is a graduate of Yale Law School. He led the Enron Task Force when he was with the Department of Justice.As head of the Criminal Division, Wray led investigations and prosecutions in securities fraud, health care fraud, money laundering, public corruption and several other areas of federal criminal law, according the the website of King & Spaulding, a Washington firm where he currently serves as a litigation partner.Via: Daily Caller",politics,"Jun 7, 2017"
"MASS IMMIGRATION, ISLAMIZATION, VIOLENCE TEAR EU APART: Norwegian And Swiss Army Chiefs Prepare For Civil War [VIDEO]","NORWEGIAN ARMY CHIEF:  We Must Prepare To Fight SWISS ARMY CHIEF: Europe  On Verge Of Civil War We must prepare to fight, says Norway s new army chief and echoes the Swiss army chief who recently came with a similar statement:Society in western Europe is on the verge of breaking down amid chaotic violence caused by economic dislocation, mass immigration and terrorism. This is not the view of some  crazy survivalist  but head of the Swiss Armed Forces.Lieutenant-General Andr  Blattmann has issued a warning to the Swiss people that society is dangerously close to collapse and advised those not already armed as part of the Swiss Army reserve to take steps to arm themselves.Blattmann has been head of the Armed Forces since, 1 March 2009 and his words carry very significant weight in a country in which several Citizens  Initiative referenda against burqas and mosques have proven enormously popular as concerns grow about immigration and Islamisation.Here s a sample of what Switzerland (named the World s Cleanest Country by Forbes in 2009) looks like today. Pay particular attention to the trash on the ground. This is just one example of a cultural divide between the Swiss, who pride themselves on being conscientious stewards of the earth, and Muslims from third world nations who appear to have no respect for their host country s environment.  Of course, this is likely a minor concern compared to Swiss residents who have suffered sexual assault and violence at the hands of the Muslim invaders:The turmoil has been brought closer, says Norway s new army chief Odin Johannessen.He believes European countries can no longer expect to live in peace and security   without defending themselves.  I think we must be prepared to fight, both with words, actions   and if necessary with weapons   to preserve the country and the values we have in common, said Johannessen in a speech to Oslo Military Society on Monday.He took over as Army Chief last October and was previously head of operations for the Defence Staff in Oslo.  The Ukraine crisis and the terror in Paris shows that Europe can no longer expect to live in peace and security, without having to defend its interests and values, said Johannessen, who spent much of his speech to emphasize the importance of well-trained and adequately equipped soldiers.  , he said.In his speech he expressed concerns over that the financial allocations are not in style with approved plans.  I can say now that it is impossible for me to reach the goals set in the current long-term plan. For us on the inside of the military system, it has been obvious for several years already, said Johannessen. Via: Speisa",left-news,"Feb 23, 2016"
 Lawmakers Condemn ‘Dangerous Abuse Of Subpoena Powers’ By GOP Panel,"Only April 28, nearly 100 lawmakers sent a letter to Marsha Blackburn, Chairman of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives. The letter condemns the panel s use of intimidation tactics against  researchers, graduate students, laboratory technicians and administrative personnel,  through what lawmaker s describe as a dangerous misuse subpoena powers.The panel was created by Republicans in October 2015, after the bogus Center For Medical Progress released a series of highly edited videos online. While the group claimed that the videos showed officials from Planned Parenthood conspiring to sell fetal body parts, the video transcripts (which you can read here) tell an entirely different story.Multiple investigations have cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing in association with the video. If that s enough, in January a Texas Grand Jury indicted two of the key players involved in creating the bogus videos, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, on felony charges.But facts are rarely allowed to get in the way of republican extremists, who continue to use the long-debunked videos as a way to push their anti-abortion agenda across the country.According to the 98 lawmakers who recently signed the letter to the Select Investigative Panel, members of the panel have moved beyond the point of repeating dangerous and false rhetoric about Planned Parenthood, launching a witch hunt which targets medical researchers, medical supply companies, students and others involved in fetal tissue research.The letter reads, in part:We are particularly concerned by the recent reports that the select panel has issued 11 subpoenas to medical supply companies and laboratories that will seek the names of researchers, graduate students, laboratory technicians and administrative personnel involved with fetal tissue research. The misuse of subpoena power is clearly aimed at not only stopping the crucial medical research, but personally intimidating the scientists who are engaged in this lifesaving work.The 98 members who signed the document strongly condemned the  dangerous tactics  employed by the panel, calling for it to be immediately dissolved.The letter goes on to rip republican lawmakers, saying: This body has spent more than enough taxpayer money doing the bidding of the Republican Congressional Committee. It is clear that this Panel serves no other purpose than to carry out politically-motivated attacks on Planned Parenthood. Not only is it insane that Republicans in Congress continue to waste taxpayer resources investigating these debunked videos, but it s reprehensible that they would use their positions as elected officials to intimidate and harass scientists, researchers and others, for their own political gain.Here are the names of the eight members of Congress who make up the investigative panel:Vote them out in November.Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2016"
"QUESTION: Since Paris Terror Attacks, How Muslim Refugees Have Arrived In U.S.? How Many Are Christians? [VIDEO]","The answer to this question should shock every American The government has admitted 605 Syrian refugees for resettlement in the United States since last November s Paris terrorist attack, two of whom are Christians.The rest are 589 Sunni Muslims, 10 Shia Muslims, three other Muslims, and one refugee identified in State Department Refugee Processing Center data as  other religion. At the same time, the proportion of Christians among the total cohort of Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. since the conflict began five years ago has now dropped below two percent.Just 55 Christians (1.9 percent) are among the 2,769 Syrian refugees admitted since March 2011, while a large majority   2,594 (93.6 percent)   has been Sunni Muslims.Christians accounted for about 10 percent of Syria s population when the civil war began and Sunni Muslims for an estimated 74 percent.The administration has rejected calls by some Republican lawmakers, and some GOP presidential candidates, for Syrian Christians to be prioritized in the refugee admission process.Here s the truth about how these Muslim  refugees  who are coming from countries who hate are finding their way  to the United States:The ISIS terrorist attack in Paris on November 13 fueled concerns that the terrorist group was exploiting the flow of refugees and migrants as cover to send jihadists into the West to carry out attacks.French authorities said two of the attackers had been carrying fake Syrian passports and warned European Union partners that  some terrorists are trying to get into our countries and commit criminal acts by mixing in with the flow of migrants and refugees. Last Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper affirmed during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that ISIS has done so. Isn t it already proven that Mr. Baghdadi is sending people with this flow of refugees that are terrorists that   in order to inflict further attacks on Europe and the United States?  Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) asked him, referring to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That s correct,  Clapper replied.  That s one technique they ve used is taking advantage of the torrent of migrants to insert operatives into that flow. In addition, he continued, ISIS has become  pretty skilled at [producing] phony passports, so they can travel ostensibly as legitimate travelers as well. In December, House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said the U.S. intelligence community  has identified already individuals tied to terrorist organizations in Syria that want to exploit and get into the United States through the refugee process.

" Mooch Changes His Tune, Says Reporter ‘Absolutely’ Recorded Him Without Permission","So here s a funny hypothetical: You re a White House Communications Director. You ve settled into your office in the West Wing. You have a definite connection with the boss   your speaking styles are similar, you come from the same moneyed and even geographical background, and just for good measure, let s say you both are known to engage in the occasional  locker room talk.  Honestly, you re over the moon at landing this job, because you ve been after it for half a year, and god knows there have been some twerps standing in your way.There s really only one thing you should be concerned with, and that s knowing how to do this. Maybe Anthony Scaramucci got so excited to work for Donald Trump that he forgot to learn that last part. And if this hypothetical were about you, dear reader, I can t imagine that you d overlook a teensy detail like knowing how to do things  off the record. The Mooch s downfall came from the hilariously bad telephone conversation he had with Ryan Lizza, Washington correspondent for the New Yorker. Scaramucci called Lizza to try and ascertain the identity of a  leaker  who had told him about a dinner Donald Trump attended. That phone call was, as everyone now knows, recorded.Now Mooch is claiming that Ryan Lizza broke the law. Or rather, he s insinuating it..@RyanLizza is the Linda Tripp of 2017. People know. And he is up at night not being able to live with himself.  Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) August 10, 2017Linda Tripp, of course, is the woman who recorded over 20 hours of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinski, whose dalliances with Bill Clinton ended with impeachment in the House of Representatives. There are questions to this day whether or not Tripp broke the law: Maryland law still dictates that all parties must consent to the taping of a phone call, but courts there ruled at the time that the law didn t apply to people who didn t know it was illegal. She broke the law, but if she didn t know she was breaking the law, she didn t break it. Ooookay.So of course that led to the question:Are you accusing him of taping the call without your permission?  Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) August 10, 2017And the succinct, albeit editorialized, answer:Yes. He absolutely taped the call without my permission. #lowlife https://t.co/fTDcBw4vcT  Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) August 10, 2017Scaramucci, like his former boss, thinks that any offense committed against him must somehow be a crime. We learned from the phone call to Lizza that Mooch believed  leaking  his (publicly available) financial disclosures to the press wasn t just a crime but a felony for which he promised to involve the FBI and DOJ. So does he think Lizza (hashtag lowlife), by recording without his  permission,  broke the law as well?Turns out it doesn t matter. In Washington D.C.   where both ends of the phone call took place   taping a telephone conversation requires only the consent of one party. Don t wonder too long about whether hitting a button to start recording is consent from one: It is. And from his tweets today, Ryan Lizza is definitely not losing sleep over it.Sorry, Mooch. You re still the dipshit who just didn t know how to do his job. And really, talking to the press is pretty much one of the only jobs a WH Director of Communications even has to do, right?Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 10, 2017"

" Democrat Forces Trump’s Own Nominee To MOCK Him, Admit Obama’s Inauguration Was Bigger (VIDEO)","Donald Trump is fuming over the size of his little inauguration last weekend. Not only did his inauguration have embarrassingly low attendance numbers when compared to Barack Obama s previous inaugurations, but it was also completely outnumbered by the Women s March, which was a protest AGAINST him!Trump has tried to make his inauguration look less pathetic by having his team spew lies, despite the fact that photographic evidence clearly shows that almost no one went to see him get sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. While Trump continues to soothe his monstrous ego on Twitter, his political opponents are having the time of their lives mocking him   and what Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley just did was the perfect way to troll someone like Trump.At the confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Mulvaney (R-SC), Trump s pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget, Merkley forced Mulvaney to humiliate Trump in front of everyone by showing side by side photos of Trump s inauguration and Obama s 2009 inauguration. To make things even worse, Merkley asked Mulvaney to publicly state which inauguration crowd was bigger.Faced with the evidence and a room full of peers, Mulvaney was forced to admit what Trump and his team wouldn t: that Obama s inauguration crowd was bigger. Merkley then tied it all together, making sure to state his point in mocking Trump. He said: The reason I m raising this is because budgets often contain varied deceptions. You and I talked in my office about the  magic asterisk.  This is an example of something where the president s team, on something very simple and straightforward, wants to embrace a fantasy rather than a reality. You can watch this beautiful moment below:Later, Merkley made sure Mulvaney got the point by calling on him to give actual budgets instead of the  alternative facts  Trump s team has become well known for.This was absolutely brilliant, and we need more senators calling Trump and his team out for their lies. They need to be held accountable, and this was a great way to do it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"January 24, 2017"
 We Watched Sarah Palin’s Trump Endorsement Speech So You Don’t Have To (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin made her first campaign appearance with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and it featured all of the authentic frontier gibberish we ve come to expect from the half-term governor and professional grifter.Let s dive into Shrieky McJutty s official endorsement of the GOP frontrunner, shall we? Mr. Trump! You re right! Back there in the press box, heads are spinnin . Media heads are spinnin . Nah. It s not that big a deal other than the fact that Sarah Palin single-handedly managed to make Trump s campaign even less serious than it already was. Put another way, Trump already acts like he s in the throes of dementia, and Palin s endorsement is like Trump getting bonked over his bewigged head with a cartoon-sized mallet. It s like a Twitter troll suddenly being defended in a flame war by the Twitter troll s drunken babysitter. Palin simply doesn t realize that everyone outside the GOP bubble watches her because she s stupid and says stupid things   not because she s any sort of political threat. Obviously.I was told, you know, warned left and right, you are gonna just get so clobbered in the press. You are just gonna get beat up. Chewed up n  spit out. N  you know, I m thinkin  And?Again, she s going to get clobbered because she has no business on a national stage discussing serious political matters. Why? Not just because she speaks as if she used Google Translate to transform her remarks into German, then translated from German back into what can only be described as horribly fragmented English, but chiefly because her speeches are mainly about her   how she always goes rogue and how the  lamestream media  hates her.To wit: When I was on stage nominated for veepee, and I got to say, [in creepy whisper voice] Yeeaaah  I ll go  Send me  You betcha  I ll serve Yes, she has a stellar record of serving   for part of her term, then quitting. And then when the McCain campaign tried to get her to stay on message, she  went rogue  and helped to doom her ticket. Good job.And now, I challenge you to sentence-diagram the following passage. Warning: it gets particularly gibberishy by the end.I m in it because just last week, we re watchin  our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage, at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law because a weak-kneed capitulator-in-chief has decided that America will lead from behind. And he who would negotiate dills [sic] uh kinda  like with the skills of a  community organizer maybe organizing a  neighborhood tea. Well, he deciding that no, America would apologize and, uh, as part of the dill [sic] as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow and we apologize and then we bend over and say  thank you, enemy? The sailors were hastily released unharmed. If Trump were president, the sailors would be dead because we d already be at war with Iran. If Palin were president, the sailors would be dead and we d be at war with the Hamburglar. [Trump] is beholden to no one but We The People. This is Trump she s talking about? Trump. Who s all about Trump, and who puts the name  Trump  on everything he touches? That Trump? Is beholden to the people? That s rich. No more pussyfootin  around. Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best. Pussyfootin ? He is from the private sector, not a politician. Can I get a  hallelujuah!  Where in the private sector where you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize to keep the main thing the main thing. And he knows the main thing. Hallelujah? Did that just happen at a Trump rally? Jesus. Also, no, balancing budgets isn t about keeping the main thing the main thing, whatever the fuck that means. Oh, and yes, Trump is a politician. If one runs for president, one is a politician by default. Sorry. And then funny. Haha. Not. Funny. But now what they re doing is wailing,  Trump and, uh, uh, his trumpeters, well they re not conservative enough.  Oh my goodness gracious, what would the establishment know about conservatism? It s at this point when Jay P. Morgan, Jamie Farr and Rip Taylor would simultaneously gong her off the stage.How about the rest of us? Right-wingin , bitter clingin  proud clingers of our guns, our God, our religion, and our Constitution.How is it possible to be both resentful of Obama s  clinging  remarks, while also being proud of it? It can t be both. By the way,  bitter clingin  proud clingers  is my new favorite Palinism, right up there with the time when she said the role of the vice president is  position flexible. All told, this is an odd alliance Trump has formed here. Palin s favorability rating among Republicans hovers at around 27 percent. Again, among Republicans. I m not sure how this helps Trump, other than to further purge any remaining support he enjoys among serious Republicans. I m not sure that standing side-by-side with this bitter clingin  proud clinger is a smart move.

"BOOM! TED CRUZ Will Conduct Hearing TODAY: Focusing On Muslim Brotherhood, CAIR And Obama Regime’s Cover-ups, “WILLFUL BLINDNESS” To Radical Islam","Ted Cruz has no interest in playing  Mr Nice Guy  with Obama or his willing accomplices in the FBI, DHS or his DOJ It s been over a week since the largest terror attack on American soil in 15 years, yet nobody in Congress has successfully steered the discussion to the actual source of our perilous security situation. The Obama administration is covering up all connections of the Orlando shooter to known Islamic terrorists with the help of the Muslim Brotherhood advising DHS and the FBI. Yet, all Republicans and Democrats want to discuss is guns. That is about to change.On Tuesday, June 28, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, will conduct a hearing investigating the willful blindness on the part of the relevant law enforcement agencies to domestic Islamic terror networks. The subject of the hearing is  Willful Blindness: Consequences of Agency Efforts To Deemphasize Radical Islam in Combating Terrorism. Senators on the committee now have an opportunity to expose the Muslim Brotherhood influence within DHS and the FBI, their invidious  Countering Violent Extremism  Agenda, and their hand in covering up counter-terrorism investigations.Senator Cruz hinted at the agenda he plans to pursue at this hearing in an op-ed for Conservative Review earlier this week:President Obama s politically correct reluctance to attribute the terrorist threat we face with radical Islam hobbles our ability to combat it by discouraging counterterrorism agents from taking radical Islam into account when evaluating potential threats. The examples of Fort Hood, Boston, San Bernardino, and Orlando demonstrate the harmful consequences of this administration s willful blindness.Just yesterday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced at a press conference that the motives of the Orlando jihadist might never be known and that  our most effective response to terror is unity and love.  This comes on the heels of the government s attempt to redact any mention of Islamic rhetoric in the 911 call and DHS releasing another internal document scrubbing all references to Islamic terror. Just this week, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a front group for Hamas, was allowed to sit in on FBI interviews with members of the Fort Pierce mosque. The FBI was supposed to cut ties with CAIR, and DOJ was supposed to prosecute them in 2009 following the Holy Land Foundation trial, in which CAIR was implicated as a co-conspirator, yet they are granted full access to FBI counter-terrorism investigations. How can Republicans let this stand for one day? Worse, they are validating the Democrat premise by obsequiously holding vote after vote on the non sequitur of gun control while our own government is willfully allowing Islamic terrorist sympathizers to operate freely within DHS and sabotage all investigations that would have prevented these attacks.This hearing will likely focus on which figures within the federal government worked to squelch any research connecting the dots between local Muslim Brotherhood officials, these individual terrorists, and foreign terror networks. Senators on the committee now have an opportunity to expose the Muslim Brotherhood influence within DHS and the FBI, their invidious  Countering Violent Extremism  Agenda, and their hand in covering up counter-terrorism investigations. They can demonstrate how the federal government has hamstrung local law enforcement by refusing to cooperate and share information regarding jihadists living in their communities.Most importantly, this is the first opportunity to finally change the narrative from the false discussion about guns, which has nothing to do with Islamic Jihad. Hopefully, this committee hearing will be the beginning of a concerted effort for the legislative branch to actually engage in some critical oversight of the perfidious actions within the top echelons of federal law enforcement. The fact that GOP leaders in the House and Senate are not pushing multiple hearings and legislation dealing with this issue is scandalous, but unfortunately, not unexpected.

 ‘Lunch Shaming’: Schools Punish Poor Kids Who Can’t Pay For Lunch With Appalling Humiliation (VIDEO),"As we all know, there are many children in America who cannot afford school lunch. Some of these kids are  lucky  (and I use the term loosely) to qualify for free or reduced price school lunches. Others are not. To qualify for these government-sanctioned programs, the children have to be from a family whose income is no more than 30% above the poverty line. That means that a family of four can make no more than $32,000 a year to qualify. Any adult living in America today understands that this is a very difficult   in fact, damn near impossible   amount of money to live on. So, this leads to many children around the country going through the lunch line at school with the inability to pay. However, the tactics used to solve this issue are downright appalling, and they are being deployed all over the nation.A practice referred to as  lunch shaming  is being used to humiliate poor children around the nation for their inability to pay for their lunches. Some kids are stamped in the lunch line with stamps that say things like,  I need lunch money.  Others are forced to clean tables in the cafeteria in front of other students. Still others even have their hot lunches thrown out for their inability to pay.All this serves to do is humiliate already struggling children for things that are far beyond their control. Further, in the cases where the lunches are thrown out, the kids are forced to go hungry. Even worse, some of these kids only get fed at school, so that means that they are literally starving when their one source of food is denied to them.This kind of thing has lifelong effects. Luckily, New Mexico has become the first state to try to put a stop to the practice of lunch shaming. They have introduced legislation that would outlaw the practice, and would make it illegal to engage in any conversations regarding a student s ability to pay for lunch at school with anyone but the student s parents or guardians.The entire nation needs to follow in New Mexico s footsteps. The fact that this sort of thing is happening in the United States of America at all is disgraceful. We should all be ashamed.Watch the video report on this practice below, via AJ+ on Twitter:Children are being shamed for not having lunch money across the U.S. pic.twitter.com/4uSyIJYIGI  AJ+ (@ajplus) April 17, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2017"
 WATCH: Anderson Cooper And Ana Navarro NAIL Hypocrite Newt Gingrich To The Wall,"Newt Gingrich must really be regretting his little temper tantrum on Megyn Kelly s show now.Because his tirade about Kelly being more  fascinated  with sex than policy really has backfired spectacularly in the last 24 hours, culminating in a brutal takedown on CNN.All Megyn Kelly did was correctly point out that Donald Trump is possibly a sexual predator, which caused Gingrich to explode in rage and be completely disrespectful towards Kelly.Anderson Cooper and his panel discussed the former House Speaker s hissy fit on CNN on Wednesday night, and it didn t take long for Gingrich to be slammed for being a total hypocrite because of his past sexual misconduct.Cooper fired the first shot by calling it  ironic  that Gingrich would call Kelly  fascinated by sex  when he cheated on his first two wives, including an affair that took place during the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton. For Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex,  Cooper said after turning to Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes for a response.  This is a guy, who s what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton. Isn t that right? Hughes used the  glass houses  defense and tried to turn the discussion into one about Hillary Clinton.Needless to say, Hughes and fellow Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany humiliated themselves by trying to defend Gingrich s offensive outburst.But GOP consultant Ana Navarro had no problem blasting Gingrich, and she corrected Cooper before proceeding to rip Gingrich a new one. I think the word you were looking for was  hypocritical.  Remember Newt Gingrich s wife? When he was running in 2012, told all of us, told the media, said it to the camera. Newt Gingrich offered her the choice between an open marriage or a divorce. So maybe, just maybe, if all of that baggage is on your shoulders, maybe you shouldn t be the surrogate out there wagging your finger and accusing the woman who was reporting on sexual assault   let me explain it slowly   sexual assault and sex are two things. One is unwanted. One is wanted. So maybe they need to understand that to begin with. Let us not confuse sexual assault and sex. And if you are going to get a surrogate to speak on it, and wag his finger on national TV, maybe, just maybe, go find the Pope or somebody that s been on his knees in a chapel for the last 20 years. Not Newt Gingrich. Here s the video via YouTube.Gingrich should publicly apologize to Megyn Kelly for his behavior on Tuesday night. It was unacceptable and only demonstrated precisely why Trump is getting hammered at the polls by women right now. Scottie Nell Hughes should tell Gingrich all about glass houses next time she sees him because he certainly could have used that advice before making a jackass out of himself. Or better yet, Gingrich should just keep his mouth shut and disappear from the political landscape entirely.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 27, 2016"
POPE TAKES COMMUNIST CRUCIFIX GIFT HOME: Says He Was Not Offended By It [VIDEO],"Well, as a Catholic the act of the Pope of my church accepting a gruesome hammer and sickle with Christ affixed to the front was wholly offensive Pope Francis has said he wasn t offended by the  communist crucifix  given to him by Bolivian president Evo Morales during his South American pilgrimage.Morales surprised the pontiff with the unusual gift, a crucifix attached to a hammer and sickle, when Francis arrived in La Paz on Wednesday.The crucifix was a replica of one designed by a Jesuit priest, the Reverend Lu s Espinal, who was tortured and killed by Bolivian paramilitary squads in 1980. Francis prayed at the site of Espinal s assassination upon his arrival in Bolivia.The modified crucifix immediately raised eyebrows, with some questioning whether Morales, whose socialist and anti-church rhetoric is well-known, was trying to score a political point with a questionable, and possibly sacrilegious, melding of faith and ideology.Francis, an Argentine Jesuit, said Espinal was well-known among his fellow Jesuits as a proponent of the Marxist strain of liberation theology. The Vatican opposed it, fearing that Marxists were using liberation theology s  preferential option for the poor  as a call for armed revolution against oppressive rightwing regimes that were in power in much of Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s.During a news conference en route home to Rome on Sunday, Francis said he interpreted Morales  gift through the prism of Espinal s Marxist bent and viewed it as protest art.After taking into consideration the time in which he lived, Francis said:  I understand this work. For me it wasn t an offense. Francis added that he brought the crucifix home with him.Via: The Guardian",left-news,"Jul 13, 2015"
 Fellow Officer Says Cops Were NOT In Danger When They Shot Suicidal Vet (VIDEO),"This week, four Fresno County, California police officers appeared in federal court over allegations of civil rights violations, including excessive force and  callous disregard for human rights. The case was brought by Esperanza Booke, sister of the late Charles Salinas.Salinas, a 46-year-old veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, called 911 on June 15, 2012. During the call he stated that he was suicidal and wanted to die.Salinas was later gunned down by three officers who were dispatched to the scene.Sanger police Sgt. Jason Boust and officers Preston Little and Angela Yambupah all opened fire on Salinas. He was struck at least 11 times by bullets sprayed from the officer s semi-automatic weapons.According to the federal suit, after killing Salinas, the officers were allowed to meet in a room at police headquarters for at least four hours, before they were ever interviewed by police investigators.The family s attorney claims that the officers used this time to plan how they would cover up their actions.The cops claim that they opened fire on the unarmed veteran after he made a series of sudden movements, which led them to believe that he was reaching for a weapon.What the cops did not know at the time, however, is that the shooting was captured on cellphone video, by a bystander.While the video has not been made public, it reportedly does not support the officer s testimony. Instead it shows that there was no lunging or jumping at the officers. What s more, on February 17, Fresno County sheriff Sgt. Joshua McCahill, testified that his fellow officers were NOT in danger when they opened fire on the suicidal veteran.According to McCahill, he was speaking with Salinas, who was sitting unarmed in a flower garden, when the other officers arrived on the scene. He testified that he did not believe his life was in danger.McCahill was the only officer on the scene who did not fire a weapon during the encounter.He testified that just before the other cops opened fire on Salinas, he called out to them to  bag  him, a term used to describe firing on a suspect with a non-lethal shotgun.Instead, the three officers turned their AR-15 rifles on Salinas. According to witnesses, the officers continued to shoot, even after the marine veteran had fallen to the ground.When asked why he did not shoot Salinas, McCahill said  because it was a non-lethal situation. According to Salinas family, he was suffering from PTSD.During the call to 911, Charles Salinas told the dispatch operator that he had no desire to hurt anyone other than himself. Let the record show that I would not even scratch a law enforcement officer,  Salinas told the dispatch operator.When conveying the nature of the situation to police, the 911 operator stated  He says he won t hurt you, but he wants to do a suicide by cop. Listen to the 911 tape below, courtesy of The Fresno Bee.This was an opportunity for law enforcement officers to do something good. There was plenty of room for these cops to use non-lethal force. Instead, they chose to end the life of Charles Salinas, a military veteran suffering from PTSD and depression.Reasonable force is defined as a level of force which would be used by  any reasonable law enforcement officer in the same situation. In this situation there was only one reasonable law enforcement officer on the other scene. That officer did not fire his weapon.

 Sean Hannity Just Got OWNED By George W. Bush’s CIA Director,"Sean Hannity openly supports Donald Trump for president and has turned his media platform into the Republican nominee s propaganda machine.Indeed, Hannity is Trump s chief propagandist and there is no low that he won t sink to in order to attack Hillary Clinton and defend Trump.Of course, Hannity denies that he s a propagandist, but if anyone knows what a propagandist looks like, it s the CIA and former CIA Director Michael Hayden says Hannity is a  true propagandist. After years of bashing Wikileaks and the group s founder Julian Assange, Hannity has just recently began praising them because they are releasing private emails from Hillary Clinton s campaign team.Wikileaks obtained these emails by illegally hacking servers in the United States, which constitutes foreign espionage against this country. But Sean Hannity is cheering them on anyway in what amounts to endorsing crimes against the United States.And Hayden ripped Hannity and Fox News a new one for doing so in a response to Brookings Institute senior fellow Benjamin Wittes. FOXNews has almost completely jumped the shark,  Hayden wrote.  They have given up any semblance of conservatism and focused on an almost visceral hatred of all things Clinton and Obama. Hannity has entered the pantheon of a true propagandist. And his behavior reminds me of a conversation I had with a political office in the mid-1980s when I was the air attach  to Bulgaria. I asked this officer what truth was to him. He responded without hesitation,  Truth is what serves the party.  And there you have it.

 Check Out The ‘Infuriating’ Thing Malia Obama Did That Has Conservatives Calling Her N***** (IMAGES),"The headline from conservative blog USA Politics Today is ominous and tantalizing:  What Malia Obama Just Did With Her Friends Will Make You Furious . It makes you want to know if the older Obama daughter has finally done something that could be considered an embarrassment to her parents. She is, after all, a teenage girl. Teenage girls tend to get into trouble no matter who their parents are. The Bush twins are a great example. While living in the White House the daughters of Dubya had their share of adventures, which were mostly chuckled off by liberals and conservatives alike, because again   they were teenage girls.Why, then, if we could laugh at the Bush twins ducking their security detail to go drinking can conservatives not forgive the shenanigans of Malia Obama? The answer to that is simple and all you need to do is read any conservative blog s comments to see why. Even when confronted by moderates who don t agree with dragging children into politics, conservatives can t help but allow their true colors to shine through:Yes, those are real comments. They accompany an array of like-minded stupidity. You can find everything from imbeciles calling her mother a  Sasquatch  to more of the same BS about birth certificates to good old-fashioned American N-word racism. No matter how ridiculous the a-holes who can t help but make fools of themselves sound, their anger must be about something pretty important, wouldn t you think? Here s a screenshot from the propaganda mill site of the entire article explaining exactly what Malia did to deserve such scathing remarks:That s it. No sources, no pictures   just a story (that dates back to 2014) that Malia made her friend pay for her breakfast. That breakfast, as reported by Inquisitr and The Christian Science Monitor, ended with an $8 tip on a $45 bill, which the waitress noted was a great tip coming from teens. Rather than report the truth, which is that Malia Obama is a teenage girl who enjoyed frozen chai and eggs Benedict with a friend, conservatives felt the need to skew the story into her being some kind of cheap skate who forced a friend to pay and leave a horrible tip.That s how a scandal is born when the people you re trying to reach are idiots who will believe anything negative you can possibly come up with about the black family living in the White House. They weren t upset when the Bush girls had some fun and got in a little trouble, because teens will be teens, but boy were they ever upset when Malia got into Harvard.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 28, 2016"
 Man Who Predicted Fall Of Soviet Union Has A Prediction About Trump Administration,"The United States as we know it is over   at least that s the prediction by Norwegian professor Johan Galtung, who s known as the man who predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union. Why is our country over? Because of Donald Trump.Galtung has been predicting the demise of the U.S. as a superpower since 2000. Back then, he said it would come in 2025. That was before George W. Bush took office, though. That presidency sped up the inevitable, according to Galtung, by five years. Trump s election is going to speed it up even more.He told Motherboard the election of Mr. Trump  speeds up the decline , although he qualified the statement, saying:  Of course, what he does as a President remains to be seen. Source: IndependentOne of the pressing issues with Trump is his nationalism, and in particular, his hostility toward NATO. The collapse has two faces,  Dr Galtung told the tech news site,  Other countries refuse to be good allies and the USA has to do the killing themselves, by bombing from high altitudes, drones steered by computer from an office, special forces killing all over the place. Both are happening today, except for Northern Europe, which supports these wars, for now. That will probably not continue beyond 2020, so I stand by that deadline. Naturally, not everyone agrees. Yet Xenia Wickett, who heads the US and Americas program at the think tank called Chatham House said that the mere fact that the United States has the largest military and some great universities will protect our superpower status for a long time.Remember, though, that this has been a year of odd predictions coming true. Despite the media and the predictions of nearly every pundit, one professor, a professor who has a track record of predicting elections, predicted Donald Trump would win.As for our military and intellectual prowess, well, Trump intends to boost military spending while decreasing tax collection. That is a quick way to bankruptcy. And, as this year s election has shown, we can no longer lay claim to intellectual superiority.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 8, 2016"
 DNC Chair Speaks Out On Revolting Trump Tape: ‘This Is Who Donald Trump Truly Is’ (VIDEO),"Interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile was crystal clear in what she thinks of Donald Trump and the bombshell tape that showed him boasting about sexual assault:  This is who Donald Trump truly is. During an interview on ABC s This Week, Brazile told George Stephanopoulos that Trump is the same person today as he was in 2005 when the appalling tape was recorded. You can draw a straight line between what Donald Trump said in 2005 and what he s been saying every day on the campaign trail over the last year and a half,  she said on Sunday.  This is not a changed man. This is who Donald Trump truly is. The DNC chair listed a few of the previous offensive remarks Trump has made on the campaign trail and pointed to these as more examples that confirmed Trump has not changed. He was and is a revolting human being. When you criticize a judge simply because of his Mexican heritage. When you call women some of the most disgusting things. When you criticize John McCain. When you criticize people who are disabled. This is who Donald Trump truly is. Brazile doesn t seem surprised by this newest tape from the past. After all, this is someone who is accused of raping a 13-year-old child. With everything Trump has done, bragging about grabbing women  by the p*ssy  is exactly the kind of thing you would expect to come out of his mouth.  But what is surprising is that after everything Republicans have turned a blind eye to over the past few years, it is now that they are finally  disgusted by Trump. I m surprised that the Republicans are disgusted by Trump after all the things he has said and all of the comments that he s made over the last couple of years.

" Minutes After Saturday Night Live Sketch Ended, Trump Was Already B*tching About It (VIDEO)","Now that it appears that Donald Trump is the inevitable next president, Alec Baldwin has job security at Saturday Night Live for at least four more years (unless Trump is impeached). Trump s not happy, at all.This week, Baldwin skewered Trump s Twitter obsession. The sketch showed the President-Elect as so distracted by his Twitter account that he just had to retweet a high school boy, rather than pay attention during a security briefing. Kellyanne,  referring to campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, played by SNL s Kate McKinnon,  I just retweeted the best tweet. I mean wow, what a great, smart tweet. When advisors reminded Trump that he was in a security briefing, Baldwin s Trump replied,  He s 16, he s in high school, and I really did retweet him. Seriously, this is real.  Trump s advisors tried to steer him back to the situation in Syria but Trump said,  God, Seth seems so cool. His Twitter bio says he wants to make America great again. That s when McKinnon s Conway dropped the truth bomb about why Trump really tweets:Trump tweets to much to  distract the media from his business conflicts and the scary people in his cabinet,  but in Trump s words the real reason is because his  brain is bad. But what s Donald Trump if he can t brag about something he had absolutely nothing to do with:As the adults in the room continued to admonish Trump for his incessant tweeting, he disputed the fact that it was preventing him from focusing on his work.  I was elected 25 days ago and already unemployment is at a nine-year low, millions and millions of people have health care and Osama bin Laden is dead,  he said.  Next I m going to do what I promised my whole campaign and I m going to build that swamp. Here s the full video:Trump was not at all happy with the portrayal.

 Trump’s Latino Adviser Severs Ties With The Campaign After Embarrassing Mexico Trip,"Donald Trump thought he hit a slam dunk with moderate and independent voters when he decided to visit Mexico. Pundits and right-wing demagogues declared it  presidential  and said the visit was proof of a  softening  on immigration.Then Trump went to Arizona, and well, that all changed.Instead of taking a  softer  approach to the issues of Mexico, immigration and illegal immigration, Trump launched into his classic talking points that a wall will be built (and that Mexico will pay for it), that the United States is being swamped with  30 million  illegal immigrants (even though that number is closer to 11 million), and that Mexican immigration poses the same threat as ISIS.Well the speech In Arizona was the last straw for one Trump adviser, Jacob M. Monty, who advises the Republican nominee on Latino issues, among other things.Just last week, Monty posted on his Facebook that Trump is  the only candidate who has the skill and will to work with Congress to improve security and deal compasionately with the undocumented population in the US. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Monty denounced Trump and severed ties after he refused to take his advice and instead pandered to xenophobia:And with that, another Trump staffer leaves do to the candidate s blatant racism, xenophobia and lack of respect for those who know what s best.Although Monty has not said who he will be supporting at this point for the presidency, Trump s camp should take the opportunity to truly reflect on who they want to vote for him: the angry whites that will vote for him regardless of how  soft  he goes on immigration, or conservative leaning Hispanic and Latino voters he desperately needs?Another public embarrassment for the Trump campaign couldn t have come quick enough. This Mexico trip certainly did not work out well in the candidate s favor.Thank you, Jacob Monty, for putting principle over party!

" Here’s The Democratic Plan To Destroy Trump, And It’s Starting Soon (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has left a slime trail across multiple decades as a public figure, reality TV star, serial misogynist and now presidential candidate. During the Republican primaries, many wondered why his fellow candidate pulled their punches, often until it was too late and he had already secured the nomination.By contrast, Democrats don t seem as if they plan to let Trump get away with the same sort of shenanigans he did within the GOP. Hillary Clinton has already begun promoting web videos taking on Trump and his racist, sexist, misogynist comments. But the real advertising power is expected to come from the super PACs, who are able to accept an unlimited amount of money (thanks to the Citizens United decision).Priorities USA, who supported President Obama s re-election and produced ads attacking Mitt Romney s record at Bain Capital, will be up on the air in June with ads hitting Trump. Our job is to be as prepared as we can to take him on in any particular instance and that s why not only will we be up on June 8, as previously reported, but we re actually going to go on the air earlier,  Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, told Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on Bloomberg Television s  With All Due Respect. Of the $91 million of air time the super-PAC has already reserved, Cecil estimates that roughly one quarter to one third of ads will be positive, with the rest painting Trump in a negative light.Cecil also estimated that about $40 million will be dedicated to online outreach targeting blacks, Latinos, the Democratic base and millennials.Cecil told Bloomberg that Priorities will be attacking Trump will highlight his smears of women, veterans, as well as his shady business dealings.

"LEFTIST MEDIA DESTROYED Mike Flynn, Cracked Jokes After Horrible LIE Obama’s National Security Advisor Told Media, Families Of Benghazi Victims [VIDEO]","Fun fact: While Trump press secretary Sean Spicer fielded 55 questions on February 14 related to the Flynn debacle, Obama s press secretary Jay Carney received only 13 questions from reporters on September 12, 2012, three of which were set-ups to blast Mitt Romney s criticism of the administration after the attack. 55 to 13.So as we now suffer through yet another patch of media mania, conspiracy theories, and unsubstantiated claims about how Trump hearts Russia, as well as the daily beatings endured by Spicer, let s reminisce to when the media and Obama s press flaks spun, deflected even joked about golf and  Saturday Night Live! less than a week after Benghazi.Buried deep beneath the Michael Flynn hysteria this week was Judicial Watch s release of newly obtained State Department documents related to the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. One email confirms again that the Obama administration knew the day after the attack it was not a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video. That was the excuse shamefully propagated by top Obama administration officials (including the president himself) and swallowed whole by a media establishment desperate to help Obama win re-election six weeks later.According to the summary of a call on September 12, 2012 between State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy and several congressional staffers, Kennedy was asked if the attack came under cover of protest:  No this was a direct breaching attack,  he answered. Kennedy also denied the attack was coordinated with the protests in Cairo over the video:  Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint. But of course nothing matches the audacity of trope by Obama s National Security Advisor Susan Rice on September 16, 2012. Rice went on several Sunday shows to peddle a story she knew was completely phony, one that was already quickly unraveling even as most in the media and administration tried to keep it intact.Rice repeats the line that Benghazi attack was not premediated and was connected to the demonstrations in Cairo over the video (a document obtained by Judicial Watch last year shows Hillary Clinton met with Rice a few days before her television appearances). Which presidential administration is fact-challenged, again?In a press gaggle on Air Force One the next day, guess how many times Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about Rice s comments? Ten? Five? One? Not once. Let me repeat that. The day after Obama s national security advisor was on five news programs to blame a terrorist attack on a YouTube video, not one reporter asked the White House about it. I actually had to re-read the transcripts several times, even checking the date over and over, to make sure this was accurate. Her name did not even come up.No discussion about the investigation. No discussion about emerging evidence from around the world that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack. (The only time it was mentioned was when Jen Psaki criticized Mitt Romney s comments about how the administration handled Benghazi and questioned whether he was ready for  primetime. )Here s what they did discuss: Debate prep, Occupy Wall Street, and the Chicago s teachers strike. An actual human reporter asked this:  It was a beautiful weekend for golf and he wasn t out on the course. Is it safe to assume maybe he was doing some preparation at the White House?  WHAT? Then they joked about football and  Saturday Night Live.

MAN ROBS TAXPAYERS OF $1.4 Million In Food Stamp Scam…Using Fish!,"Feldman operates Upstate Fish, a market at 826 Joseph Ave. His father, Jack, a Holocaust survivor, opened the store under the name Jack s Modern Fish Market in 1954 and is a well-known figure in the community. A year ago, the elder Feldman was among a number of Holocaust survivors who had Hanukkah dinner with the Obamas and the president of Israel at the White House.Irving Feldman was accused of two different schemes, one netting more than $1.2 million and the other more than $200,000.The more lucrative scheme involved unlawfully buying $1,227,063 worth of food stamps from willing recipients for less than half their face value, according to the news release. The recipients received cash, and Feldman was able to reap a considerable profit by redeeming the food stamps with the federal government for their full value. This fish market owner was caught running a food stamp fraud scheme that was truly breathtaking in scale,  state Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott said.Feldman also admitted to a second scheme in which he induced food stamp recipients to use their benefit cards to buy fish from other retail markets, then sell the fish to him at steeply discounted prices. The recipients pocketed cash, and Feldman got inventory he could sell at full value.The value of that scheme was about $202,000, the official statement said.Read more: DandC",Government News,"Dec 18, 2016"
MAJOR OUTDOOR CLOTHING COMPANY With Ties To Human Trafficking Wages War On President Trump Over Outrageous Obama Land Grab,"The CEO of outdoor clothing giant Patagonia is burnishing her anti-Republican bona fides again, this time saying she intends to pledge her entire company to the  resistance  of President Donald Trump.Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario recently attacked President Trump for his statements about rolling back President Obama s unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as  national monuments. We have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,  Marcario said in a May article at Huffpost.  I don t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now. In an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the Trump administration for its efforts to scale back Obama s unprecedented land grab. A president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument,  Marcario said in an April 26 statement after Trump announced his national monuments order.  An attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input. In particular, the Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obama s order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obama s actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obama s policies in April, President Trump called Obama s move an  egregious abuse of federal power. Many state governments fully agree with Trump s assessment and were furious when Obama swooped in from Washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks.A poll of residents of Utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed Obama s land grab, while only 33 percent supported it.This is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters. Last year, the California-based company spent over $1 million for a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans.  BreitbartPatagonia is an accredited and founding member of the Fair Labor Association; its website is as much an educational tool about environmental and social responsibility filled with information on issues such as preservation of land in Chile, labeling GMO products, and responsible sourcing as it is an online store. In a note launching the company s food division, Patagonia Provisions, company founder Yvon Chouinard restated the brand s central ethos:  We aim to make the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and perhaps most important, inspire solutions to the environmental crisis. And yet, despite these aspirations, four years ago internal audits turned up multiple instances of human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation in Patagonia s supply chain, according to Cara Chacon, the company s director of social and environmental responsibility, and Thuy Nguyen, the manager of supply chain social responsibility and special programs.",politics,"Jun 19, 2017"
 President Obama Brought To Tears In Emotional Speech About Needing Smarter Gun Laws (VIDEO),"President Obama could not hold back the tears while discussing the excessive amount of lives lost over the years at the hands of guns during his press conference on Tuesday. In what is perhaps one of his most emotional speeches in recent memory, President Obama asked the nation to start having a  sense of urgency  to finally get rid of gun violence, once and for all.Now, every time the president speaks, the nation notices. This time, however, the president practically cried on live TV. It wasn t the type of crying a baby would do, but rather the sort of emotional embrace you would expect a strong leader to show talking about an issue as critical as this one.With that said, actions speak louder than words   and even tears. That is why the president not only gave a great speech but announced what his new executive actions on gun control would entail. The gun lobby might be holding Congress hostage right now but they cannot be holding America hostage. Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40%. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the internet with no background check, no questions asked. 1 in 30 people looking to buy guns from one website had a criminal record. This is not a plot to take away everybody s guns We can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. People are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do. No longer suffice. That s why we re here today. Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Trump Whines That The Media Wouldn’t Film His Crowd In Alabama – CNN Makes A Fool Out Of Him,"Trump s desperation to convince people that the Great Liberal Media Conspiracy Against Him is real is getting way out of control. On Twitter earlier, he cried that nobody was asking about the media s totally biased coverage of Hillary during the election. He also claimed at a rally a while back that the press was turning their cameras off during his speech because they didn t want their audiences to hear what he had to say. CNN made him look stupid for that. Then tonight, in Alabama, he did it again, and CNN made him look even worse for it.He said,  Fake news. They won t show this,  referring to his obsession with his crowd sizes. He then went on to say: They ll say  Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night. It was a small crowd. A very unenthusiastic crowd. It was a terrible evening. CNN had split the screen between him and his crowd before he started this diatribe. Seriously   he said this while CNN was showing his crowd.

WATCH: IRRELEVANT DEM POLITICAL ANALYST James Carville Says Trump’s Mental State Needs To Be Looked At Because of His Sentence Structure,"On Friday s broadcast of HBO s  Real Time,  former Clinton Campaign Manager James Carville stated that President Trump lacks empathy and sentence structure, and someone has to examine his mental state like people did at the end of the Reagan presidency.Carville said,  I think what happened was, is General Kelly told the president when he called this war widow that   look when, people   fighting men and women understand that when they take on this mission they could die for the country or for each other, and it s something that binds them together, and you have to make that point. Of course, Trump has no empathy and his sentence structure is completely gone. He can t say two sentences.   So, he gets on the phone, and he says,  Well, that s what he signed up for.  And General Kelly heard what I wanted. I mean, the truth of the matter is, somebody has to look. You know, when President Reagan was president, towards the end of his term, Howard Baker had a memo, and they seriously were looking to see if he had any kind of cognitive issues and they decided that he did not. I don t think Trump is capable of making those two thoughts.   BreitbartAt about the 2-minute mark, Democrat Party political analyst James Carville starts his rant about why President Trump needs to look at Trump s mental state:In October of 2016, James Carville piled on with another guy who just can t seem to get anything right, crybaby Mark Cuban. Carville and Cuban were guests on Maher s show when Carville told Bill Maher and friends that then-candidate Trump was going to quit the race.BILL MAHER: Donald Trump was supposed to have a rally tomorrow with Paul Ryan and now he has been disinvited   this just happened before we went   and it s going to be Mike Pence and Paul Ryan. Wow. When the top of the ticket is disinvited to his own rally?MARK CUBAN: He s finally toxic. Donald Trump is finally toxic.JAMES CARVILLE: Mark and I got in a discussion before the show. I think he s going to quit. Really, right now, I m saying right here.[APPLAUSE]MAHER: You know why he s not going to win? Because his basket of deplorable and if the basket fits Carville hasn t been right about too much of anything in his career, but since he helped to get the impeached rapist into the White House, the media will always use him as their go-to-guy when it comes to getting advice on how to stop the Republicans winning elections.",left-news,"Oct 21, 2017"
 WATCH: Navy Unveils The Latest Reason We Can’t Afford National Healthcare (VIDEO),"A new war toy for the Navy was shown off recently in an article published in the Wall Street Journal.The  supergun  as the WSJ s headline refers to it, is really just a large railgun. A railgun is a weapon that uses an electromagnetic charge to fire a round rather than chemical explosives.The only time that cost is mentioned in the article is when it compares the cost of using a railgun projectile versus that of a standard missile. The WSJ reports that each projectile only costs around $25,000 dollars to make, compared to the cost of a $10-million-dollar interceptor missile.  Wow, it almost sounds as if this thing might actually save the military some money in the long-term. It won t though, it s just another military pipe dream that ll end up costing tax payers an arm and a leg   possibly literally seeing as the money that could go towards building these things might have gone to something useful, like a universal national health insurance program.The weapon requires a massive power source the rail gun requires 25 megawatts to work. As Vice pointed out in an article published last year, this need for a huge power source is the reason this technology is going to be quite costly, or even possibly impossible to make practical for a long time. It s hard to conceptualize 25 megawatts, for me anyway. For some perspective, th e Navy s next generation Zumwalt-class destroyer, the 21st-century stealth battleship with electric engines, is powered by a 78-megawatt array of turbine generators. So, firing a rail gun once would take almost a third of the most advanced ship s whole capacity. Most ships today don t have more than 9 megawatts to spare. . . The railgun is going to be tested on the USNS Millinocket next year. The first of three Zumwalt-class ships railgun or no railgun is slated to be delivered to the Navy next year, and the last in 2018. They re estimated to cost $22 billion in total. The bigger problem here is that the United States is entering into a new Cold War era, except this time it is with both Russia and China. Projects like this may give the U.S. a small military advantage over one of these two nations for a few years at least. Then we will have to spend billions upon billions of dollars on new weapons systems that everyone is terrified of actually using, considering the chance that a full nuclear response is a possibility.We have to really ask ourselves is this the road we want the U.S. to go down. Of course, we cannot leave ourselves defenseless but we seriously have to make decisions about what we invest our money into. How exactly do we plan to use these weapons systems, should they ever actually become practical? We also have to ask ourselves if it is more important to spend countless billions of dollars on weapons that are built-in, the justification of defense against the Next Bad Thing, yet will probably end up just being used to  spread a little democracy  to poor nations.I, for one, would prefer to invest in building a nation that makes sure that every person is given the opportunity to get an education, see a doctor, or breath clean air and drink clean water than one that is hell-bent on winning another cold war.You can watch a video of the railgun below.

 Trump Can’t Find One Latino For His Cabinet; Here’s Why,"While it s certainly not true that Donald Trump will have the least diverse cabinet in history. Hell, before a generation or so ago, it was rare to see women or People of Color in positions of authority, but it s 2016. The culture is changing and skin color and gender (and religion and sexual orientation) shouldn t matter at all.Judging by the looks of his cabinet nominees so far, Trump s administration will be the least diverse since Bush George H.W. Bush.Trump, or more likely, someone working for Trump, knows that he needs to offer at least some diversity, especially with the enemies he s made in the Latino community with his  wall  rhetoric in the campaign. The problem is, though, he can t find any in a country with about 57 million Latinos and Hispanics. I can tell you now I have spoken to numerous folks on the transition, and they say that he s absolutely looking for qualified Latinos for a Cabinet post,  said Mario Rodriguez, head of the Latino PAC Hispanic 100. Rodriguez, who sits on Trump s Hispanic advisory committee, said transition officials have asked him for recommendations and they gave him positive feedback about Trump s prior meetings with Hispanic candidates. I think some appointments are going to be pretty quick. President-elect Trump was very impressed by the candidates. He wants to put a Latino in the Cabinet, he s not doing it just for show. Source: PoliticoTrump is trying to fill the position of Agriculture Secretary with a Latino and he s receiving a lot of backlash from his farmer supporters. According to Politico, the farmers don t want it to be a political pick. Of course, they are Trump supporters, so there s a better than even chance they don t like the idea of someone with brown skin determining farm policy, especially after Trump said he wants to deport Latinos.Part of the problem is that Trump is looking for a qualified Latino to take the position. There s no doubt there are plenty, but few who likely share his political beliefs. Still, it s weird that he should look for qualified now. His current picks are some of the least qualified to ever serve office (remember, Rick Perry, who has just a Bachelor s Degree and nearly flunked a class called  meats,  is slated to be Energy Secretary and Ben Carson, who is a doctor, a medical doctor, will serve as Director of Housing and Urban Development) just as he is among the least qualified who will ever serve in the Office of the Presidency.Even if Trump is able to hire a Latino   even a qualified one, it might not matter.Many Hispanic leaders say they are less concerned about having a Cabinet pick than what Trump s policies could mean, particularly with deportation and a wall along the Mexican border. These people say picking a Hispanic Cabinet member for agriculture could be seen as a token with little real value and liken Trump naming his only black Cabinet member to lead Housing and Urban Development.In other words, Trump could have the most diverse cabinet ever and still be the worst president for diversity in history. What Latino (or really anyone) in their right mind would want history to remember them in that way?Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"December 28, 2016"

Chopra, 68, said that Trump epitomizes, among other things, the  darkest demons  of America s  collective psyche.

And yet he s so popular because he s given permission to our collective psyche to express their darkest demons. Radio host Colmes asked Chopra if Trump is himself a racist and bigot, or whether he just represents those ideologies to his supporters.

BREAKING: 19 Yr Old Ethiopian Immigrant Sentenced For Beating 97 Yr Old WWII Veteran To Death With Spatula In Iowa [VIDEO],"The mother of the 19 year old immigrant blames the murder of the WWII veteran, and the brutal beating of his wife on the violence their son was exposed to in an Ethiopian refugee camp. Unfortunately for the 97 year old WWII veteran and his wife, this immigrant family found a  safe place  in the United States <sarcasm> A Des Moines man who beat an elderly neighbor to death was sentenced Monday in a Polk County court.Last month, a judge found Ngor Makuey, 20, guilty of first-degree murder. Makuey broke into the home of Rupert and Harriet Anderson and attacked the couple, killing Rupert with a metal spatula. Via: KCCI Des Moine Moments before an elderly man was killed and his wife beaten, the 19-year-old accused killer asked his parents for permission to go for a walk. When he came home he had blood on his clothes. Now police are trying to figure out why a teen who has never been in trouble with the law could be accused of such a horrible crime.In a desperate plea for help, 94-year old Harriet Anderson called 9-1-1 after she and her husband were attacked in their home here on East 46th Street Wednesday evening.  Somebody got in the house and attacked me and my husband and I m all bloody. And I m an old woman,  Mrs. Anderson told the dispatcher.  And I m on the floor and my husband s been hit in the head.

Anderson s husband, 97-year-old Rupert Anderson, a WWII veteran, died after the attack.Minutes after police arrived, 19-year-old suspected killer Ngor Makuey walked past the police car of one of the responding officers with blood on his sweatshirt. The police car s dash camera caught a shot of Makuey. It was shown to neighbors and he was arrested. Police say what makes this case so disturbing, there didn t seem to be a motive for the attack, and Makuey has no criminal history.  Zero history. I mean zero. There s nothing until last night,  said Des Moines Police Sergeant Jason Halifax,  (He) knocked on the door, and I think the initial request was something about a pet. No known connection between him and a pet. We don t believe he has a pet or had a pet there at any time. She made some comment about what the hours of the business are and then the assault begins. Makuey was found at his parents  home about a block away from the Andersons. He in charged with murder and attempted murder. Makuey is not a US citizen. His parents, who immigrated to the US from Ethiopia 12-years ago, think their son is innocent.The 19 yr old Ethiopian s mother apparently has a little trouble with the truth: I never seen that kid get in trouble with somebody else,  said Makuey s father, Jinud Ruath.  He s a very respectful child. And he never disrespects anyone. I ve never seen him get in a fight with other people.  Via: WHOTVMakuey s attorney used the insanity defense during the trial, but witnesses say they saw no signs of mental illness.Makuey received a sentence of life in prison plus two years sentence for Count 2 as well as ordered to pay a restitution of $150,000.

 Trump’s ‘Deportation Force’ Storms Unarmed Legal Resident’s Home And Shoots Him,"A Chicago man is in critical condition after the mother of all epic f*ckups by Trump s  Deportation Force.  On Monday morning, ICE agents raided the home of Felix Torres. It is unclear why they would choose to raid the home   not a single person inside is undocumented   but apparently, we are not too concerned about accuracy when we kick down brownish people s doors in Trump s America.At approximately 6:00 a.m., immigration agents entered the home, refusing to tell any of the residents why they were there. According to officials, Torres pulled a gun on the armed men who had forced their way into his home and refused to explain their presence   Torres  family says that s utter hogwash. They didn t say anything. They just came in and pointed pistols in our faces and dragged us out,  Torres  daughter Carmen says, noting that she was not even allowed to dress or grab milk for her one-year-old daughter, who was sleeping when the armed men invaded the home.  It s a lie when they say he was holding a gun. He doesn t even own a gun,  she said.  They shot my dad. They shot him, and I don t know why. At least eight family members were in the house at the time, including numerous children. According to Carmen Torres, the family has lived there for  at least 30 years. We re going to have to talk to CPD to find out if this was a coordinated effort, because if it was in any way, that raises concerns about us as a sanctuary city,  36th Ward Alderman Gilbert Villegas said of the attack.  Is this our future in Chicago with Donald Trump as president? The community s got to be nervous about this, and rightfully so, because you have a right to be in your own home without being intimidated,  Villegas says.  I m conflicted because I haven t got all the details [of the incident] yet, but from the way this has started to play out, it looks like an overstep by an overzealous ICE agent who s just trying to follow Trump s orders. ICE officials say they were not at the home to arrest Torres, though they will nor provide further details. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital where his condition is listed as critical. The shooting is being investigated, though we probably can not expect much in terms of a reasonable resolution to the situation.Featured image via Facebook",News,"March 27, 2017"

" Bitter Cruz Claims He ‘Doesn’t Know’ John Boehner, Forgets Boehner Once Hired Him To Sue A Democrat","Sen. Ted Cruz is attempting to stop the bleeding after a brutal dress down by his former colleague John Boehner became headline news.Boehner, who resigned as Speaker of the House last year and thus has absolutely nothing left to lose, told a Standford University gathering that he disliked Trump but absolutely reviled Ted Cruz. How much does Boehner hate Ted?The deeply Catholic former politician accused Cruz of being  Lucifer in the flesh.  He explained that his hatred of Cruz transcends politics:  I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.  John Boehner HATES Ted Cruz.This isn t exactly surprising. Most human beings seem to come to the same conclusion at one time or another. In fact, the more you get to know Ted Cruz the more likely you are to despise him. His old college roommate famously hates him.As a freshman, I would get into senior parties because I was Ted's roommate. OUT OF PITY. He was that widely loathed. It's his superpower.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) January 10, 2016People might think Craig is exaggerating. He's not. I met Ted freshman week and loathed him within the hour. https://t.co/2ZrbTdjHJh  Geoff (@gacohen) January 20, 2016His former law colleagues famously hate him.In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment. Some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges.His fellow politicians hate him. I don t know how he s going to deal with Congress,  Bob Dole recently remarked.  Nobody likes him. When it comes to the junior senator from Texas, ignorance is bliss.Cruz s response to Boehner s blistering assessment of him was as telling as it was weak. When asked about it, Cruz pretended to not know the guy. Truth of the matter is I don t know the man,  Cruz said, adding that he d be surprised if he s said more than 50 words to him.  I ve met the man two or three times. Cruz wants us to believe that he has never spoken to the guy he worked closely with to shut down the government in 2013. Yikes.But more damning still, Cruz actually knows Boehner very well. He was his lawyer.Back in the  90s, Boehner needed a young conservative lawyer to help him destroy the political career of a Democratic rival. Ted Cruz was just the guy for the job.Per The Washington Post:The year was 1998. Shania Twain and Savage Garden were all the rage. Boehner was House Republican Conference chairman. He had decided to sue Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) for allegedly violating wiretapping laws.At issue was a recorded phone conversation in 1996 involving Boehner and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, among others. A Florida couple intercepted the call on a police scanner. The couple gave a recording of the call to McDermott, then the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee. (Gingrich was facing ethics sanctions.) McDermott shared it with the New York Times. And, well, Boehner wasn t happy.Cruz was hired, and even wound up publicly speaking in support of Boehner after   as was his plan all along   he used the publicity from the lawsuit to fundraise for his re-election campaign.It s hard to imagine that Cruz and Boehner didn t share more than a few late night gab sessions during that period. The relationship was certainly mutually beneficial. Boehner won his re-election and Cruz got to brag about taking down a Democrat and use that persona to sell his Tea Party agenda when he eventually got around to running for office.Lyin  Ted, indeed.Featured image via Win McNamee and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016"
HILLARY TO OBAMA: “call off your f–king dogs”,"According to insider, and author Edward Klein, Hillary took on Barack Obama over his involvement in exposing her email scandal several months ago. Many Americans are wondering if Obama is stonewalling the FBI s  investigation, or if in fact, he is encouraging the investigation, hoping it will take her down.  This isn t the first report of Hillary behaving in a manner that is, shall we say,  un-presidential?   According to White House insiders, it seems that Bill has been on the receiving end of Hillary s rage more than once as well   An enraged Hillary Rodham Clinton blew up at President Obama, demanding he  call off your f king dogs  looking into her emails during a tense Oval Office meeting, according to a new book.The book,  Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary,  says the former first lady was furious at what she believed were damaging leaks by Obama aides that led to investigations of her use of a private email server as secretary of state. So she went right to the top to settle the matter.Clinton requested a meeting with Obama, against the advice of hubby Bill Clinton, believing  she was being persecuted for minor, meaningless violations,  author Edward Klein writes.Clinton initially took a friendly approach during the meeting and Obama reacted as if he didn t know what she was talking about, the book claims. He was almost being deliberately dense,  a Clinton source said.  It really angered her. Clinton lost her temper and called the president by his first name in an emotionally driven break with White House decorum, according to the book. What I want for you to do is call off your f king dogs, Barack!  Clinton allegedly barked at Obama, according to Klein s account, which cited sources close to Clinton and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.The president was so stunned by Clinton s disrespectful demands, he needed a moment to compose himself, the book claims.Obama then responded,  There is nothing I can do for you one way or another. Things have been set in motion, and I can t and won t interfere. Your problems are, frankly, of your own making. If you had been honest . . . Klein reports Clinton interrupted,  There are always haters out there to get the Clintons. The Democratic 2016 front-runner is said to have later regretted her tirade against the president   not for the disrespect she showed, but for the weakness she displayed.Nick Merrill, Clinton s spokesman, called Klein s account  bulls t. Another book? Someone should do a book about Ed,  said Merrill.  They could call it  Bulls t: The Problem with Anything Ed Klein Writes. The only true thing about him is his consistent and utter lack of a relationship with the facts,  Merrill said.  He has more hair than credibility, and the man is bald. So we re not going to get down in the gutter with him and his outrageous fabrications.

 Lindsey Graham Makes The Most Depressing Prediction For Republicans After Backing Cruz (VIDEO),"Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been going through an existential crisis over the future of his party for a while   especially now that he s backed presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who he doesn t believe will stand a chance against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.On Thursday, Graham went on MSNBC to share his thoughts on the election and make a prediction that truly showed how depressed Graham has become over the whole thing. The former presidential candidate reluctantly said that Republicans would  probably  lose the 2016 election due to the extremely unlikeable qualities of leading GOP candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.Graham had backed Cruz after ending his own campaign for GOP nomination, clearly because the Texas senator was the only alternative to Trump. Graham made it perfectly clear that the endorsement didn t mean that he suddenly liked Cruz, a man that Graham previously joked about murdering. Not to mention that earlier this year, Graham said that choosing between Trump and Cruz was like being shot or poisoned. What does it really matter? But now, Graham seems like he s accepted the fact that the Democrats have the 2016 race in the bag. During the interview, he said: We can lose in 2016 and probably will. Here s my concern. Trump gets wiped out. Ted, I don t know if he can beat Hillary Clinton or not but at least we ve got a fighting chance.If Trump is the standard-bearer, it s not about 2016, it s about losing the heart and soul of the conservative movement. I m not going to stand behind a guy that gets David Duke s support. You can watch Graham resign all hope in the video below:.@LindseyGrahamSC: We could lose in 2016 and we probably will https://t.co/QJOaVYjtV6  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) March 24, 2016The reason Graham is feeling so hopeless is that he knows he s right. Both Trump and Cruz are extremely polarizing to voters. Ted Cruz has an uncanny ability to make most people   whether politicians, family members or voting Americans   hate him (which might be linked to the way his face looks). And Trump tends to turn many GOP voters off for his vulgar language and constant flip-flopping on policies. Both of these candidates are an embarrassment to the Republican party, and Graham was dead-on when he said it would take generations  for the GOP to recover from this election cycle.

UNREAL! Michelle Obama Gets $70 Million For Program To Empower Girls BUT Not American Girls,"Unreal! Mooch gets millions for Pakistani girls? The American taxpayers should be outraged by this! Let Pakistan empower its own people! Michelle Obama has been traveling all over the world with the Let Girls Learn initiative as her pet project. The only thing is that most of the places she s traveled to have a great track record with educating girls. It s just one big around the world vacation for Mooch compliments of the American taxpayer. Judicial Watch s Tom Fitton had this to say about the trip: The Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades EUROPEAN VACATION: MOOCH RUNS UP A HUGE TAB COMPLIMENTS OF THE TAXPAYERS Could someone please remind this woman that America is BROKE! As public schools around the United States suffer through a perpetual financial crisis, the Obama administration commits a breathtaking $70 million to help educate girls in a terrorist nation known as Al Qaeda headquarters. It s part of the First Lady s initiative (Let Girls Learn) to educate and empower an estimated 62 million girls in third-world countries who are not in school. A noble cause indeed, but it s costing American taxpayers huge sums while kids especially minorities in this country struggle in schools that aren t adequately funded, according to public education advocates.  We know that countries with more girls in secondary school tend to have lower maternal mortality rates, lower infant mortality rates, lower rates of HIV/AIDS, and better child nutrition,  according to the initiative s website.  But too often, a girl who could change her world for the better is locked out of that future by the circumstances of her birth or the customs of her community.  So it s Uncle Sam to the rescue. The government of Pakistan, which is included in the State Department s Country Reports on Terrorism, will get the $70 million to promote education among 200,000 girls and young women age 10-19. The announcement was initially made during a White House event this month with the wife and daughter of Pakistan s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The program will serve as a platform and catalyst for broader political and social commitment to strengthen girls  education and empowerment in Pakistan, according to a government announcement.  Young women in Pakistan face barriers and lack of access to education opportunities from an early age due to poverty, cultural norms, and geographic isolation,  the announcement states. The question remains; should American tax dollars go to this foreign education cause when public schools in this country have been hurting for years? Besides financial troubles, there s an epidemic of low-performing schools and dismal graduation rates around the country, especially in the nation s inner cities. They could probably use a few million to create programs that might help improve academic performance or perhaps empower needy students like the multi-million-dollar allocation is predicted to help empower girls in Pakistan. The public school district in the Obamas  own hometown of Chicago could use some extra cash. By Thanksgiving as many as 5,000 teachers could be laid off unless the 367,499-student district Chicago Public Schools gets a $500 million bailout from the state. A recent editorial in the area s mainstream newspaper says that it  has been a disastrous time for Chicago Public Schools.  The piece is accompanied by an illustration of a yellow school bus with  Corruption & Politics in our Schools  plastered across the side. Districts across the nation are in similar situations. In Detroit, Michigan the public school system has a $515 million debt and among the nation s worst performing students. Read more: Judicial Watch",politics,"Oct 28, 2015"
" Trump Team Says Elton John Is Performing At Inauguration, Elton John Tells Trump To Go F*ck Himself","If Donald Trump thought he d be seeing Elton John sing his praises on Inauguration Day he was sorely mistaken.During an interview with BBC, Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci claimed that openly gay singer Elton John will be performing at Trump s inauguration on January 20th. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for inauguration,  Scaramucci said, adding that John s appearance  shows our commitment to gay rights. This will be the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay rights stance,  Scaramucci continued.There s just one problem. Apparently, Trump and his team failed to ask Elton John first.Because after hearing about this claim, Elton John told Trump to go f*ck himself.First a representative for John made it crystal clear that the openly gay artist isn t going anywhere near Trump s inauguration.  Elton will not be performing at Trump s inauguration,  the rep said.Then John s publicist Fran Curtis rejected the claim more emphatically.  Incorrect. He will NOT be performing. Donald Trump may be a fan of Elton John, but the feeling is far from mutual. John supported Hillary Clinton for president and said of Trump just last month that,  We need a humanitarian in the White House, not a barbarian. Just because Donald Trump said on 60 Minutes that same-sex marriage is settled law, it doesn t mean that the LGBT community believes him. After all, Trump s running mate is Mike Pence, a man who is vehemently anti-gay. Plus, conservatives expect Trump to nominate anti-gay judges to the Supreme Court, which puts gay rights in serious jeopardy.So while Trump is claiming that he s pro-gay rights, his actions need to speak louder than his words if he wants the LGBT community to stand behind him. Because Elton John is not going to be used as a propaganda tool.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"November 23, 2016"

First Grader “Investigated” in Principal’s Office for ‘Misgendering’ Trans Student,"Can you believe a first grader was  investigated  for whether she intentionally  misgendered   a fellow student who decided to identify from a boy to a girl? This is just too much for a young child to process. You really won t believe what this little girl went through. What would you do as a parent of a child who was punished because of  misgendering ?APPARENTLY,  MISGENDERING  IS A THING NOW A Californian first grader was sent to the principal s office this week after allegedly  misgendering  a transgender student. The incident reportedly took place at California s Rocklin Academy, in the school playground, where the female student called her biologically male classmate  by his given name   apparently unaware that the boy now identified as a girl,  according to Fox News. This innocent little first grader sees a classmate, calls him by the name she knew him last year and the boy reports it to a teacher,  claimed Karen England, from the Capitol Resource Institute.  The little girl gets in trouble on the playground and then gets called out of class to the principal s office. During her visit to the principal s office, the child was reportedly  investigated  to determine  whether or not she had bullied the transgender child by calling him by his original name. After about an hour it was determined the little girl made an honest mistake and she was not punished or reprimanded. But she was terribly traumatized by the incident,  Fox News claimed.After the child returned home upset, her mother wrote a letter to the school. I stressed over and over with the principal that I am all for protecting the rights of [the transgender child], but my children have rights as well,  wrote the mother in her letter.  It makes me sad that my daughter felt like she was punished for trying to be kind to the kid. In response, the mother was allegedly  told that whenever there is a pronoun mishap with this biological boy who now claims to be a girl   the school must investigate.

WIKILEAKS EMAIL SHOWS CLINTON FOUNDATION FUNDS Used For Lavish Wedding Of “Spoiled Brat” Chelsea Clinton,"An email released by WikiLeaks on Sunday appears to show a former top aide to Bill Clinton arguing that an investigation into Clinton Foundation spending would show that Chelsea Clinton used foundation resources for her own wedding.The email, stolen from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and published by WikiLeaks, shows a back-and-forth between Podesta and Doug Band, a former aide to Bill Clinton.Band said he heard that Chelsea Clinton was  conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi [Clinton Global Initiative] to the foundation.  He said he was hearing more  chatter  about how Chelsea was talking about internal issues like that, and said it was  not smart. In a later follow-up to Podesta, Band wrote,  The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents I hope that you will speak to her and end this,  Band added.

 BOMBSHELL Report Just Dropped Showing Gorsuch Is A Fraud,"Apparently, original ideas are a liability in the Donald Trump administration. Nearly as many Trumpsters have been accused of plagiarism as weeks he s held in office. Okay, that s a slight exaggeration, but Neil Gorsuch, the man who s about to be rammed into a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, appears to have plagiarized some of his writing.We should have known when Trump s own wife Melania plagiarized part of her Republican National Convention speech from Michelle Obama.Once in office, Trump picked Monica Crowley to head the National Security Council. You got it, she plagiarized her Ph.D. dissertation and the book she published in 2012.Crowley was forced to drop out of contention, but Betsy DeVos is Trump s education secretary and in a move that would get a child kicked out of school, she plagiarized part of the questionnaire she filled out to get the job. Now, it appears, Trump s pick for the Supreme Court is also guilty of plagiarism.Politico obtained several documents that showed several passages of Gorsuch s 2006 book,  The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,  were nearly identical to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal. There were also several other incidents.In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her. Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982 Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known pediatrics textbook,  Rudolph s Pediatrics,  and a 1983 article in the Bloomington Sunday Herald.Politico reports on documents showing that SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch plagiarized the work of others. Behold: https://t.co/XQnCmd62Ia pic.twitter.com/ooc2TkG2bA  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) April 5, 2017There s more. Read the Politico article for all the instances.The White House is calling the accusations false: This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed, professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch s scholarly writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the false attack,  said White House spokesman Steven Cheung.  There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-second smear of Judge Gorsuch: those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream nominee to the Supreme Court. Experts disagree with the White House: Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation of academic ethics. I ve never seen a college plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of,  said Rebecca Moore Howard, a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively on the issue.Not that it should make much of a difference.

WHOA! 2006: HILLARY CLINTON CAUGHT Expressing Regret About Not Rigging Palestinian Elections,"Crooked Hillary has always been crooked. She s just been better than anyone America s ever seen at not getting caught On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is  rigged. Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,  said Sen. Clinton.  And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. Chomsky recalls being taken aback that  anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader, no less that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.For entire story: Observer",left-news,"Oct 28, 2016"
 ‘Make Rape Legal’ Blogger Whines To Cops From Mommy’s House Over Alleged Threats,"Daryush Valizadeh, a  neo-masculinist  movement leader and blogger who tried to hold events around the nation and world for like-minded men this coming Saturday is running scared. First, he announced that he could not guarantee the  safety and privacy  of other misogynist douchebags at his  Return of Kings  meet-ups, so he announced that this  International Tribal Day  would be cancelled, as would all future events. The internet, politicians, and various other organizations and public figures rightly condemned the gatherings organized by a man whose misogynistic writings include calls to make rape legal.Now, Roosh V., as he is known, is alleging that he is being threatened. Like most bottom-feeding lowlifes, it appears that this loser lives in his mommy s house, despite being a grown man who has been quite successful at peddling his anti-woman garbage under the guise of being a  pick up artist.  He contacted authorities after the cancellation of the worldwide meet-up events, and told police that at least one threat said, We will kill you if you come to our city. Now, death threats serve no purpose, and they are illegal. No one should be sending him or anyone else threats, though the urge is certainly more than understandable in this particular case. What he expected to happen, exactly, when he decided to organize events steeped in dangerous ant-woman teachings, I ve no idea. Of course any reasonable person would be disgusted and outraged at the prospect of such people gather in their cities and neighborhoods.One organization that had planned to protest the New York City meeting of Roosh V s event said that while they are glad that the horrific meeting was cancelled, their work is far from done: They took to their Facebook event page to say the following: We showed the entire MRA, PUA and neo-masculine movements that they are not welcome, and should we see them in person, they ll never forget the experience (to put it politely). But we are vehemently of the opinion that we shouldn t just pat ourselves on the back and call it a day. No, rape culture still permeates our society, and we re f*cking tired of it! Any reasonable person realizes that  Men s Rights Activists,   Pick-Up Artists,  and  neo-masculinists  are all the result of rampant misogyny and rape culture.

When Tapper pressed Clapper about what he meant about the institutional danger from the inside, Clapper said he meant Trump.Of course, Clapper is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. There has never been such an assault on our Republic from within the very top levels of government, and certainly we ve never had a president who was in the pocket of the Russians the way Trump is.

 President Obama: Hillary Clinton Is Undoubtedly Qualified To Be President,"Hillary Clinton was one of the most hands-on First Ladies this country has ever seen. From healthcare to childcare, Clinton took the lead in sparking new and necessary debates on a multitude of issues. She then served, in her best capacity, as Senator of New York. For two terms, she carved out a bipartisan (yet liberal) ideology that more than a few times caused her to take heat   both from the right and the left.As Secretary of State, President Obama s words sum it up best: One of the best decisions I ever made as president. Even after forty years of public service, fighting for the things that matter (albeit, with some mistakes made along the way), some on the left don t think she s qualified to be President of the United States.Following his own lead, the White House confirmed that President Obama disagrees with some of those on the left, namely Senator Bernie Sanders, and thinks that not only is Clinton unequivocally qualified to be the president, but as deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz puts it to reporters:The president has said that Secretary Clinton comes to this race with more experience than any other non-vice president in recent campaign history.President Obama also added, again, that he was  proud  of Clinton s service as Secretary of State.Clinton has made building on President Obama s legacy a staple in her campaign. The White House s praise of Clinton s qualifications is paramount as the heat turns up in New York between her and Senator Bernie Sanders, who faces an uphill battle to win the nomination.Currently, Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight gives Clinton a 95 percent chance of winning New York. The White House s praise (and possibly veiled endorsement) could carry weight for Clinton amongst Democrats and left-leaning independents. Last month, President Obama told Democratic donors to unite behind Clinton, but denied that signaled an endorsement. Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2016"

 Boeing Reponds To Trump’s Air Force One Tweet: You’re A F**king Idiot,"Update: Slate has pointed out that the Pentagon has  budgeted $4 billion in total spending through 2021 for two new Air Force ones from the company.  If one plane is four and earmarked R&D is the black-and-white cost of the project, he s right. It isn t, and he isn t. The Pentagon s earmarked funds are not the projected budget by Boeing. Donald Trump made news this morning for a Tweet stating:  Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016I don t know where he got that idea. Like many of Trump s ideas, it was likely pulled from the ether, or maybe from the ass of a white nationalist on Twitter. Boeing was quick to set him straight, however   considering the project is more than an order of magnitude less than Trump thinks it is. Here s Boeing s statement on the matter:We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.According to Rueters, in January, when the contract was awarded,  Details about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the Air Force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets. Costs   and the number of jets   can change, but it s still not clear at all what Trump is talking about. Even various right wing publications which have blown up the cost over the last year have not reported a figure over three billion, and even that was not sourced to any budget sheet.And, no matter the cost, it s very clear that Donald Trump has no idea what is being paid for. There will be multiple planes, first of all   two or three   and even if the project DID run that far over budget (there is no evidence of that), it s not just the president s version of a private jet:What drives the price tag isn t the cost of the plane, it s all the costly modifications and equipment that must be installed on such a unique aircraft,  said Loren B. Thompson, a senior aviation analyst and industry consultant with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.Air Force One is filled with communications gear and defensive equipment to evade airborne threats, such as anti-aircraft missiles. It s really not just about getting the president from point A to point B,  Buckley said.  It s adding communication equipment. It s adding defensive gear. It s adding everything that the president needs in order to execute his mission in that airplane. He has to be able to do everything in all his roles: commander in chief, chief executive, head of state, president of the United States. Boeing s 747 is the only U.S.-built jet that can support all the functions required of an airborne White House,  Thompson said.  The plane must be linked to all U.S. military forces worldwide and able to function even in the midst of a nuclear war.

 Meet The Black Man Donald Trump Tried To Murder (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has often campaigned as the self-described  law and order  candidate in the 2016 presidential election. But one of the men Trump tried to persecute is speaking out against the reality TV star.As recently as last week, Trump argued that the Central Park Five should be behind bars. The men were five young black men who were railroaded by the criminal justice system and falsely accused of raping a white woman (known as the Central Park Jogger). Eventually, after they were imprisoned, another man was connected to the crime via DNA evidence and the Five were released. They received a court judgment and were rewarded monetary damages for their unjust incarceration.Trump took out a full-page ad during the trial, calling for the boys  execution. Now, one of those men, Yusef Salaam, is speaking out about Trump and his incitement and what Salaam describes as  calling basically for us to be murdered. Yusef Salaam said Donald Trump s infamous full-page ad calling for the deaths of the Central Park Five would in an earlier era been the impetus that sparked  mob justice    in a new ad against Trump. They had our names, our phone numbers and addresses in the papers so what would ve happened? Somebody from the darkest places of society would ve come to our homes, kicked in our doors, and drug us from our homes and hung us from the trees in Central Park. That would ve been the type of mob justice that they were seeking. Trump still refuses to accept that these men are innocent, part of a troubling pattern from the Republican nominee in a blas  attitude towards black concerns and safety. Asked during the debates about police brutality against blacks and the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has instead gone at length about  stop and frisk  and inner city crime. It is his go-to position and rhetoric when speaking about black people.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 13, 2016"
WATCH: 75-YR OLD TRUMP SUPPORTER Says She’d Rather Go To Jail Than Remove Trump Signs From Front Yard,"In a city that has more registered Democrats than Republicans, one has to wonder if the sizes of the signs are a problem, or if the excessive number of complaints from Hillary voters is really the issue A 75-year old Maine woman is saying that she would rather go to jail than take down her signs in support of President Trump.Susan Reitman of Rockland, Maine, is displaying two signs in her hometown that read  I Love Trump  and  He Won, Get over it,  according to New England Cable News.But the signs are in violation of local law because they are larger than allowed by the town, meaning she could face fines of $100 or more every day they re up.Assistant code officer Bill Butler told NECN that another resident had complained about the signs and that they are not allowed to be displayed without a permit.Signs in the town can be no larger than two square feet, while Reitman s come in at more than three feet by two feet.Reitman is pushing back, saying her right to free speech is more important than the law and has no plans to remove the signs or pay any fines. If I have to sit in jail for the rest of eternity, that s my choice,  Reitman said. I guess I m being stubborn   but I m not going to back down from what I believe. The Hill",politics,"Sep 26, 2017"
" Kentucky Republicans Introduce Abortion Ban, Tells Women They Have No Choice","Kentucky Republicans declared war on women as soon as the new legislative session began.One of the 11 bills introduced on Tuesday would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy based on the Republican assertion that fetuses feel pain at that point in a pregnancy.However, that assertion is not supported by science.According to multiple studies, including one in 2005, scientists generally agree that fetuses can t feel pain until well into the third trimester after 24 weeks. The 2005 study suggests 28 weeks. This is real science. Abortions after 24 weeks are already allowed to be limited by states under the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision made by the Supreme Court.But Kentucky Republicans added insult to injury by telling women that they the only choice they have is to get pregnant or not.Kentucky GOP Senate President Robert Stivers told the Courier-Journal that a mother has a  choice early on to make a decision to conceive or not conceive. But once conception starts, there becomes another life involved. And the legislature has its ability to control how that life may proceed or how it would be terminated. Did you hear that, Kentucky ladies? A middle-aged white guy just told you that you don t have a choice and that he has the right to CONTROL your body and your reproductive health decisions.And you can bet Republicans are going to be introducing similar bills and much worse in states across the nation and federally since Republicans control Congress and will have a puppet in the White House starting on January 20th.ACLU of Kentucky communications director Amber Duke condemned legislation as  a serious threat because they ignore women s health needs in individual circumstances. We believe that women deserve dignity and should have the right to make personal and private medical decisions without interference from politicians,  she said.This proves once again that Republicans hate women and they are even more dangerous now than ever before.Featured image via WomanSurvival.com",News,"January 4, 2017"

 Roads Melt As Record-Shattering Temperatures Hit India (VIDEO),"This week temperatures in the town of Phalodi, located in the state of Rajasthan, India, reached 123.8 degrees F. It was the highest temperature ever recorded in the country.As CNN reports here, the brutal heat is taking a massive toll on the people and the economy. At least 400 people have died from heat-related causes over the past four weeks.Photos published by CNN here show devastated crops, dead livestock and melting roads in New Delhi, where temperatures reached 109 degrees F.A video posted to YouTube reportedly shows  a road in Shaheed Chowk, Silvassa, Gujrat,  which  is melting due to scorching heat. The country s current deadly heat wave comes on the heels of a devastating summer heat wave which claimed the lives of more than 2,500 people in 2015. Last year s deadly wave of heat in India was the fifth deadliest in recorded history.Think Progress reports:According to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, India is getting hotter as humans continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. With these increases in heat, the report   produced by 1,250 international experts and approved by every major government in the world   said with high confidence that the risk of heat-related mortality would rise due to climate change and population increases, along with greater risk of drought-related water and food shortages.Today there are 330 million people in India who do not have access to enough water to fulfill their daily needs.The country has reported higher than average temperatures throughout 2016.As Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, explained to Think Progress, the unprecedented heat waves sweeping across India are happening with  current global warming levels of just 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. If we continue down this same path, scientists say global temperatures will rise seven to nine degrees by the end of the century.Climate change denying republicans in Congress should be required to spend some quality time in India. Maybe walking on melting roadways and baking in a slow oven, set to 124 degrees F, would help them come to grips with reality.Image credit: video screen capture via World Wide Viral on YouTube",News,"May 29, 2016"
 WATCH: Donald Trump Suggests President Obama Is Aiding Terrorists,"In the wake of the worst mass shooting in American history committed by an ISIS sympathizer, Donald Trump appeared on Fox News to accuse President Obama of helping the terrorists.After hearing that 50 people were massacred at an LGBT night club in Orlando on Saturday night, Trump s callous first reaction was to give himself a pat on the back for being  right  about terrorism. You know, because not just any idiot can predict that an attack of some kind will happen in the future.But on Monday morning during an interview on Fox & Friends, Trump crossed the line by actually suggesting that President Obama is not doing anything to fight terrorism and may be aiding the terrorists. He doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands. It s one or the other,  Trump said.  And either one is unacceptable. We re led by a man who is a very   look, we re led by a man that either is, is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can t believe it. People cannot   they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There s something going on. It s inconceivable. Here s the video via YouTube.President Obama doesn t need to say words to defeat ISIS. Despite what Trump says, Obama has been fighting ISIS for a long time now even as Republicans in Congress refuse to declare war on the terrorist organization they paved the way for in the first place by invading Iraq back during the Bush Administration. Claiming that President Obama is in league with the terrorists is just absurd and outrageous.Airstrikes killed a top ISIS leader in March, which was only the second such strike to take out a member of ISIS that month. A strike also took out an ISIS commander in Iraq in January and yet another strike killed an ISIS leader in Libya last November.And that s only four of the many such airstrikes that have dealt major blows to ISIS and their operations.But according to Trump, President Obama only has to say three words and ISIS will somehow magically disappear off the face of the planet, thus demonstrating once again that Trump is completely unqualified to be president. Because while he is congratulating himself for a prediction that any three-year-old could make and running his mouth about what President Obama should say to defeat ISIS, our commander-in-chief has been taking action. If Trump really wants to blame someone for not being hard on ISIS he should blame the Republicans in Congress for not exercising their power to declare war. The president can only do so much without Congress and Republicans are sitting on their hands instead of doing their jobs.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,"June 13, 2016"

 Trump Supporters Object To Prince Harry’s Recent Engagement For Terrible Reasons (TWEETS),"Great Britain s Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that Prince Harry, the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales, had gotten engaged. A royal engagement is always big news in the United Kingdom, but this one also hit home in the United States too, because Harry s now-fiance is American actress Meghan Markle, best known for her roles as Rachel Zane in the legal drama series Suits, as well as special agent Amy Jessup in the sci-fi thriller Fringe.The British royal family no longer holds anywhere near as much clout as it once did, now essentially relegated to mere tabloid fodder, but while many were expressing their happiness online for one of the Windsor s most beloved members, quite a few Trump supporters expressed their dissatisfaction at the prince s choice. You see, Markle is biracial, her father being Caucasian and her mother African-American, and in the minds of many deplorables, this is a bad thing.It s completely irrelevant that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and husband of the reigning Queen Elizabeth II, is half-Greek, because that is pretty much white. However, when news broke of Prince Harry s engagement to Markle, white supremacists from across the United States and around the globe took to Twitter, because in their twisted minds, disturbing the racial purity of the British royal family is not a good thing, despite the fact the fact it has been going on for centuries. Here is but a mere sample:It's all smiles on TV but in private the #QUEEN is figuring out how to stop #PrinceHarry from destroying the #royalbloodline with mixed race #royalwedding #godsavethequeen $fb $twtr $goog #MAGA  $PENNY KING (@groman100) November 27, 2017Totally unsuitable as a Royal bride.

That s right, Prince Harry has made it quite clear that President Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding, despite the bride being a United States citizen. Barack and Michelle Obama, on the other hand, will more than likely be welcomed with open arms.Both Harry and especially his mother, Princess Diana, are well-known for their humanitarian work and according to a close source, the prince is  not a fan  of Trump.  Harry thinks the president is a serious threat to human rights,  the source continued, but there might be a lot more to it than just that.When Princess Diana split from her husband, Prince Charles, in 1992, a palace aide claims that Trump was  relentless  in his pursuit of Diana, a claim backed up by British TV journalist and friend of the princess, Selina Scott. Scott said that Trump bombarded Diana at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets of flowers,  adding that he gave Diana  the creeps,  a fact Trump representatives obviously deny. Then there were these tweets from Donald Trump when Princess Kate Middleton, wife of Harry s brother, Prince William, was illegally photographed by paparazzi sunbathing topless in her backyard in 2012:Kate Middleton is great but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude only herself to blame.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2012Meghan Markle has also been a critic of the President, calling him misogynistic  and once even threatened to leave the US if he became president, so she would most likely be fine with Trump s non-attendance at her wedding, but his supporters won t take too kindly to him being shunned.Featured image via Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation",News,"November 28, 2017"
Hey Packers and Bears: We Don’t Lock Arms for the National Anthem! [Video],"Last night s game between the Bears and Packers is usually a fun-filled event that s become a huge tradition for football fans everywhere. Last night was no exception!The stadium was filled with fans who chanted USA, USA! The fans were ready to see hand over heart during the national anthem but got something very disappointing instead. The players from both teams tried to split the difference and stand for the anthem while locking arms. Outraged fans considered it just as much a protest as taking a knee, the gesture made famous by former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick who kicked off the protest last year. I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free,  Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran Steven Tiefenthaler told the Green Bay Press-Gazette.Packers fans are in a unique position to have their voices heard because unlike the privately owned 31 other NFL teams, theirs is divvied up among over 360,000 fans who own over 5 million shares of the franchise. The division mirrored the stand-off between NFL players and President Trump who last week called for any athlete who kneels during the anthem to be fired.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Sep 29, 2017"

OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOOTS AND KILLS Black Lives Matter Supporter After He Broke Into Cop’s Home Following Facebook Argument,"This is truly a sad and senseless situation. This young man, who is now deceased was given a scholarship to college, was a star athlete, and now he s dead. Why? Because Barack Obama started a race war and tens of thousands of influential young men and women have bought into it, hook, line and sinker. Hillary has been promising to keep the hate and division alive. If America likes seeing innocent cops being gunned down in cold blood, or watching relationships between people of different races turning into nonsensical violent confrontations, vote for Hillary to keep this nightmare alive An off-duty St. Louis County police officer shot and killed a man who tried to enter his home in Lakeshire in South County on Saturday afternoon, according to police.The intruder was a 20-year-old man known to the family who had recently made threats toward the family and  uninvolved members of the community  on Facebook, police said Saturday night.Police Sunday morning identified the intruder as Tyler Gebhard, 20, of the 7900 block of Navajoe Street in the Affton area.An uncle, Patrick Brogan, 57, of Waterloo, Ill., said Gebhard became acquainted with the county police officer through a church connection.Brogan said his nephew, a former Affton High School football standout, suffered from bi-polar disorder.According to Brogan, the officer and Gebhard had been arguing on Facebook about Black Lives Matter.Gebhard, who was biracial, empathized with the group s objectives but did not actively participate in protests, Brogan said.The Affton School District website notes that Gebhard was a 2014 recipient of the Howard Foundation of St. Louis Scholarship, awarded by the United Negro College Fund.Brogan called his nephew  a hard-hitting kid at football. Gebhard, he added, also excelled at golf.Nikki Toal, a family friend who also resides in Waterloo, described Gebhard as a  wonderful kid. He was a sweetheart,  Toal told a reporter outside the family s Affton home.  The nicest person you could ever meet. Family members told Brogan the disagreement between the two men culminated with Gebhard traveling from Affton to Lakeshire late Saturday afternoon.St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar at a Saturday press conference did not identify the officer involved beyond describing him as a three-year veteran of the department.The officer was placed on administrative leave pending investigation of the incident.Belmar on Saturday offered a timeline of what occurred after Gebhard arrived in Lakeshire:The officer, the chief said, was at home about 5:50 p.m. with his wife, mother-in-law, a toddler and an infant child when a man later identified as Gebhard started ringing the doorbell.When the wife answered the door with the infant, she immediately recognized Gebhard.She shut the door and went to a back bedroom with other family members.Belmar said that before the officer could get to the front door, Gebhard went to the rear of the house, where he threw a 50-pound concrete planter through a window to enter the home.Members of the family in the bedroom said they heard the officer tell the intruder to  get down, get down, get down,  and then heard several shots fired, Belmar said.As the shots were being fired, members of the family were trying to escape from a bedroom window.Gebhard was shot twice in the chest. He was taken to St. Anthony s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  I don t think the officer had a choice   I honestly don t,  Belmar said. He called it  a very difficult position to be in. Belmar wasn t sure whether the gun was the officer s department-issued firearm or his personal weapon.Brogan said the events of Saturday afternoon left two families devastated.An uncle, Patrick Brogan, 57, of Waterloo, said Gebhard became acquainted with the county police officer through a church connection.Brogan said his nephew, a former Affton High School football standout, suffered from bi-polar disorder.Family members told Brogan the disagreement between the two men culminated with Gebhard traveling from Affton to Lakeshire late Saturday afternoon. He walked over there and into a gunfight,  Brogan said, drawing on accounts offered by friends of his nephew.  When he got there he was met with a gun and the guy killed him. Brogan said Gebhard periodically stopped taking medication. He was like a normal 20-year-old, (the family) had to stay on him to take his medication,  Brogan said.The uncle said the disorder worsened during Gebhard s first year at Southeast Missouri State in Cape Girardeau. He had a lot of mental problems the last few months,  Brogan said of the 2014 Affton High graduate.  A lot of difficulties in life. Gebhard had football profiles on several prep sites.Several members of Gebhard s extended family are in law enforcement, Brogan said.Via: St. Louis Post-Dispatch ",politics,"Jul 10, 2016"

BREAKING NEWS: DACA IS DONE! WATCH AG Jeff Sessions Explain Why Obama’s Unconstitutional Act Has Harmed Americans,"President Trump keeps another promise. The winning streak for Americans continues The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives.

During his plea, Khan alleges that the only reason the two have not dropped Trump is due to fear of the political consequences of the move. If your candidate wins and he governs the way he has campaigned, my country this country will have a Constitutional crisis like never before in the history of this country. And my conscience compels me under these really difficult circumstances.  [I have] very raw emotions. I am a very composed person. I don t become that emotional but there is so much at stake and I appeal to both of these leaders. There comes a time in the history of a nation where a moral stand must be taken regardless of the political cost. The only reason they are not repudiating his behavior, his threat to our democracy, our decency, our foundation, is just because of political consequences. Both Ryan and McConnell have tacitly spoken out against the comments Trump made about the Khan family.

PRESIDENT TRUMP TO CUBA: Send Back Escaped COP KILLER…Poster Child For Black Lives Matter Movement [VIDEO],"The inspiration behind the  Black Lives Matter  movement   the individual cited by its founder and regularly quoted by its supporters   is a convicted cop killer who is on the FBI s  Most Wanted Terrorists  list.In an article which details the philosophical foundation of  Black Lives Matter , BLM co-founder Garza cites,  Assata s powerful demand in my organizing work. Assata is a reference to Assata Shakur, otherwise known as Joanne Deborah Chesimard, a radical feminist and Marxist revolutionary who escaped from prison in 1979 while serving a life sentence for the murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.On the night of May 2, 1973, Shakur, along with two other accomplices, killed Foerster execution-style at point-blank range during a routine traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in East Brunswick.For Shakur, the shooting was the culmination of years of militant radicalism during which she joined and left the Black Panther Party because it was not violent enough, before subsequently joining the Black Liberation Army, a domestic terror outfit responsible for bombings and assassinations throughout the 1970 s which claimed the lives of 13 police officers.  InfowarsShe escaped from prison in 1979 and fled to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum, and she s been there ever since.President Trump on Friday demanded that Cuba return notorious New Jersey cop killer Joanne Chesimard to the United States to face justice.During a speech in Miami to announce changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, Trump said the return of Chesimard and other fugitives was one of several steps the Cuban government needed to take before the longstanding embargo could be lifted. To the Cuban government, I say, put an end to the abuse of dissidents, release the political prisoners, stop jailing innocent people, open yourselves to political and economic freedoms, return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop killer Joanne Chesimard,  aka Assata Shakur Trump said.Following the passing of brutal dictator Fidel Castro, BLM wrote a love note of sorts on Medium, expressing their gratitude for harboring their hero, cop-killer Assata Shakur: A final lesson is that to be a revolutionary, you must strive to live in integrity.

WHY ARE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK ATTENDING BILDERBERG’S 2015 LUXURY SECRET POLICY CONFERENCE?,"Why are banking powerhouses, European Prime Ministers, a major arms manufacturer, a representative from the US State Department, Facebook and Google all attending the same secret policy summit? One of Bilderberg s founders and steering committee member, Denis Healey said in 2001:  To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing. From The Guardian: As one summit closes, another opens. Thursday sees the start of the influential Bilderberg policy conference, which this year is being held in Austria, just 16 miles south of the G7 summit, and in a similarly inaccessible luxury alpine resort. The participant list for the conference has just been released by the organisation, and some big names leap off the page.No fewer than three serving European prime ministers will be attending, from the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium. They will be discussing  European strategy  with the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, and the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer. Two European finance ministers are on the list: one Dutch, the other George Osborne. The UK chancellor is a regular attendee of the Bilderberg summit, and this year he will be showing off his post-election glow. Unlike that other Bilderberg regular, Ed Balls, who is being invited back despite having by some considerable distance the weakest job title on the list:  former shadow chancellor of the exchequer.Europe s hottest financial potato, Greece, is on the conference agenda, and it s good to know Beno t Coeur , a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will be there to discuss it in strictest privacy with interested parties, such as the heads of Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Banco Santander and HSBC.The scandal-hit HSBC and everyone s favourite vampire squid, Goldman Sachs, are both extremely well represented at this year s conference. HSBC in particular by its chairman, its busy chief legal officer, and board member Rona Fairhead, who is also on the board of PepsiCo and chair of the BBC Trust. Good to know the BBC is in such safe hands.Other financial luminaries on the list include the vice-chairman of BlackRock, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management and the president of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is the nation s largest financial institution. Morgan Stanley will be represented in Telfs by board member Klaus Kleinfeld, who also runs the world s third largest aluminium producer, Alcoa.From the worlds of industry and manufacturing are some eye-wateringly big names. The CEO of Michelin is invited, along with the head of Roche, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, the chairman of BP, the CEO of Siemens Austria and the heads of various industrial conglomerates such as Techint and Investor AB, companies so large they re hard to classify. Although  gigantic  goes some way towards it.It s a heady step up into the big league for Michael O Leary, the CEO of Ryanair. He ll doubtless be hoping to thrash out a few last-minute deals over dinner with the head of Airbus, Thomas Enders.Apart from making holiday jets, Airbus is also one of the world s biggest arms manufacturers, and the 2015 conference agenda has a distinct whiff of war. Chemical weapons threats and Nato are both set to be discussed. Luckily the head of Nato is there to discuss it.As ever, foreign policy formation is a big part of the conference. Terrorism and Iran both make the agenda this year, and participants can expect a high-level briefing from senior US State Department official John R Allen, the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Isil. And it s likely that the subject of Russia will be of interest to the German defence minister and deputy defence minister, both of whom have found the time this week to be in Telfs. As has the head of the Danish intelligence service, who will likely have a part to play in the session of cybersecurity.Finally, it s worth noting the growing presence of Google at Bilderberg. The company s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, is on the group s steering committee; he ll be joined in Austria by his vice-president for engineering, advanced technology and projects, and the vice-president of engineering for the not-at-all terrifying sounding Google DeepMind. They, presumably, will be leading the session on artificial intelligence. This will be listened to with great interest by Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and director of Facebook, as he continues his quest to merge with computers. But that s another story.For now, the story is: Bilderberg 2015 has an extremely high-powered participant list, featuring a large number of senior politicians and public figures. With participants this powerful, and an agenda containing this many hot topics, the Telfs policy conference is sure to be covered in depth by the world s press. And by  sure to be , I mean probably won t be. For reasons that, as ever, escape me.Via: The Guardian ",Government News,"Jun 9, 2015"

 Teen BRUTALLY Hits Back At Trump And His Sexual-Assault Supporting Fans With Epic T-Shirt,"Trump rallies are not for the meek. They re for the racist, misogynistic violent dregs of society   and they re for the super brave who oppose them and who may well get beaten up for having the gall to attend. 18-year old Anna Lehane took a chance, though, and attended an Oct. 10 rally while wearing a deliberately inflammatory t-shirt.It didn t say  Black Lives Matter,  which is what both of her friends wore. Her shirt read this: Grab my pussy. I dare you. Now that Trump rally is over, here is picture of this bold young protester s message pic.twitter.com/ZCnCHWTqBQ  Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) October 11, 2016That is a bold message, particularly for a young woman at a Trump rally. She told The Huffington Post: I made the shirt as a protest to people in the public spotlight on such a global platform making such disrespectful, degrading and misogynistic comments and still being taken seriously. It s patently disgusting that Trump is even still in the running for President, and still has the following he does, after we learned that he brags about sexually harassing and assaulting women. It s exposed a fundamental and sickening flaw in right-wing culture in the U.S.Some are questioning the foolhardiness of such a t-shirt. If Lehane had gotten grabbed, no doubt many would blame her for inviting it with that t-shirt. And she did get a lot of lewd comments about it from what she called  creepy old men  at the rally.Then there s this guy, on Twitter, who basically said something similar to what a lot of white people say about black people protesting police brutality   there s a time, a place and an appropriate way to make a statement. That comes from discomfort with the message, and is intended to silence. Nonetheless:@tripgabriel @MarkRosner3 That isn t brave. It s vulgar and stupid.  Jason M. Kates (@JasonMKates) October 11, 2016@Shapunkin The shirt is vulgar. There s no arguing that. It s stupid to wear vulgarity. I suppose some stupid people would argue that.  Jason M. Kates (@JasonMKates) October 11, 2016Newsflash: Protesting is supposed to be disruptive and scary. It s supposed to make us uncomfortable. Otherwise the message is totally lost. That s why did Lehane did it: I felt disillusioned then with the opinions of [Trump] and any woman who supports him,  Lehane tells ELLE.com over the phone,  You can t control how I vote by grabbing my whatever. The fact that I m a woman doesn t mean that I m easily influenced or controllable or someone who shouldn t be taken seriously.' Indeed, women aren t being taken seriously with this. Many of us have come forward with our own, painful stories of harassment and assault something we shouldn t have to do to be heard and still gotten slapped down as though we don t matter. When we stand up for ourselves in light of Trump s sexual assault boasts, we re told everything from,  That s boys being boys; you re being too sensitive,  to  This is why progressives lose,  to  Other issues matter much more than this,  to  You need to understand that they were just words.  And so much more.Please.Wearing that kind of a shirt at a Trump rally is brave. You can t make a point, and drive home a message, when you do it the way other people want you to do it. Lehane seems to know that, which is why she did what she did.Featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet ",News,"October 12, 2016"
CAN YOU GUESS THE ONE THING Majority Of Bernie Sanders Supporters Have In Common?,"The function of socialism is to raise suffering to a higher level.  Norman MailerBernie Sanders has raised a lot of money during the 2016 Democratic primary. In fact, his supporters often brag about his fundraising as proof of his viability as a candidate, just like Obama supporters did back in 2008.With all that in mind, you ll never guess what most of Bernie s donors have in common.The Los Angeles Times reports:Who gives money to Bernie Sanders?Small-dollar contributions have been the fuel that has propelled Sen. Bernie Sanders  presidential bid, making it one of the most successful insurgent campaigns in Democratic party history, but little has been known about those donors because campaigns don t have to publicize the names of people who give $200 or less.Now, a Times analysis of nearly 7 million individual contributions has provided unprecedented detail about the army of people behind the $27 donations Sanders mentions at virtually every campaign stop.Many resemble Emily Condit, 40 of Sylmar, who has contributed three times   $5 each   to the Vermont senator s campaign.Condit, who has several physical disabilities, is among the largest single group of Sanders  donors   those who don t have a job. Of the $209 million given to the Vermont senator s campaign, about one out of every four dollars came from those not in the workforce, who include the unemployed or retired.Here s a handy chart that puts things in perspective:So the  free stuff  candidate is being bankrolled mostly by people who aren t working.Anyone surprised?Via: Gateway Pundit",left-news,"Jun 5, 2016"
#VeryFakeNews CNN Underestimated Their Opponent: New Report Shows CNN Takes MASSIVE Nosedive In Ratings,"CNN is finally seeing the serious repercussions of reporting #VeryFakeNews, while Fox News remains number one in ratings.CNN s ratings are plummeting, according to a Thursday cable TV rankings report by TV Newser.CNN fell to 10th in average total day viewership among all basic cable networks in the week of June 26 to July 2, far behind first-place Fox News and third-place MSNBC.An average of 639,000 viewers tuned in to CNN per day during the measurement period, less than half of the average 1,390,000 viewers who tuned in to Fox News per day during the same period.CNN s ratings slump is a remarkable drop from just a month ago, when CNN sat in fifth place among all basic cable networks the week of May 29 to June 4.CNN lost an average of 159,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.Fox News and CNN continue to climb in ratings as CNN tumbles.Fox remained number one in all of basic cable, gaining an average of 7,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.The Thursday ratings report is a slap in the face to CNN, which claimed on June 27 its  most-watched second quarter in history. CNN s rating slump occurred in the same week three CNN staffers resigned following a damaging retraction of a story that falsely linked a Trump transition official to the chief executive of a $10 billion Russian investment fund.The network was also hit with a number of undercover videos published by undercover journalist James O Keefe, one of which revealed a CNN health producer dismissing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative and another that revealed CNN contributor Van Jones labeling the Russia story a  nothing burger. Unfortunately for CNN, the ratings report released Thursday does not take into account the latest controversy to hit the network, indicating that its ratings could possibly plummet even further in the coming weeks.CNN came under fire Tuesday for apparently threatening to expose the identity of a private citizen who initially claimed credit for creating a GIF President Trump tweeted showing Trump tackling CNN.#CNNBlackmail trended worldwide Tuesday after the network made public its decision to mask the identity of the private citizen on the condition that the man no longer engages in what CNN considers to be  ugly behavior.

 House Republican Wants To Ban The Treasury From Putting Harriet Tubman On Currency,"Long story short: a Republican member of the House has filed an amendment to block the United States Treasury, which is responsible for monetary transactions in this country, from putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.But it has nothing to do with race whatsoever, the Republican says. Of course not.Rep. Steve King is the one behind the amendment. You know, the guy who says Mexican immigrants have calves the size of cantaloupes because they smuggle so many drugs into the country. He s totally not racist, and wants you know why. Pulling a $20 out of his pocket, the Congressman from Iowa declares: It s not about Harriet Tubman, it s about keeping the picture on the $20. Y know? Why would you want to change that? I am a conservative, I like to keep what we have. But the Congressman didn t stop while he was ahead. Naturally, he went on to say something incredibly stupid, adding that putting women or people of color to our currency was actually in of itself sexist and racist, and of course blamed liberals for political correctness: Here s what s really happening: This is liberal activism on the part of the president that s trying to identify people by categories, and he s divided us on the lines of groups.   This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president, and mine s unifying. It says just don t change anything. Dear Congressman: putting a black woman, an abolitionist, on our currency isn t divisive. Trying to block a federal agency by withholding money, because you oppose a black woman being on currency, is divisive.King then accused President Obama of  disrupting civilization  over the decision.So not only is he a flaming racist, he s a total drama queen.Luckily the Rules Committee refused floor consideration of the overtly racist amendment.

 Watch Joe Scarborough Frantically Backtrack After Donald Trump Outs Him As A Supporter (VIDEO),"Considering left-leaning MSNBC still signs Joe Scarborough s paychecks and he s consistently feigned neutrality in the presidential election, it seemed clear that his support of Donald Trump was meant to remain under the radar. Unfortunately for that facade, nobody bothered to tell Trump.While Scarborough was interviewing Trump on MSNBC s Morning Joe things reached an awkward tipping point when the Republican front-runner casually remarked that he appreciated the fact that Scarborough and his co-host Mika Brzezinski were his  supporters  while most of the media was against him. It was great seeing you, you guys have been supporters and I appreciate it. And not necessarily supporters but at least believers. Hilariously, this sent the pundits scrambling to undo the potentially career-ending damage of being tainted with Trump s name. After all, it s bad enough that they, in their capacity as journalists, would choose to pull for any particular candidate, but a racist, xenophobic, torture-enthusiast one is egregious. Brzezinski fares pretty well. She has consistently criticized Trump s toxic demagoguery. Scarborough on the other hand In his clawing desperation to distance himself from Trump, he manages to throw several of his colleagues under the bus as well: Well, I will tell you what when you say  supported  you re talking about how actually   you re talking about Bob (Costa), Mika, myself, also Halperin, Willie and those of us around the table. There were a handful of people who for six months have been saying what happened last night could happen, and the rest of the media world has been mocking and ridiculing what he s done. But while Scarborough would like us to believe he s simply a political savant who predicted Trump s rise, there is mounting evidence that he really does long for a Trump win.In December, when Trump s campaign was starting to change from  This guy is a complete joke  to  This guy could actually win the nomination,  Scarborough openly bragged that he helped Trump prepare for the first debate. It was largely considered to be a make-or-break moment for Trump and his buddy Joe Scarborough was there to help walk him through the process. Let s allow Scarborough to tell it. I ve actually called him up, and I ve said  Donald, listen, you need to speak in complete sentences in debates.  And he goes,  I m up 30 points, Joe,  and I m like,  Good point, Donald,  he said to laughter.He later admitted he met personally with Trump to congratulate him on his second debate performance, albeit saying I hope we don t have reporters here. Further, there has been rumors that Scarborough and Brzezinski met up with Trump on the night of the New Hampshire primary to celebrate his first win. Again, he had hoped to keep it a secret. CNN broke the story anyway:Scarborough and Brzezinski visited Trump s hotel room on Tuesday night while the New Hampshire primary results were rolling in, according to two sources with knowledge of their visit. Scarborough and Brzezinski did not respond to a request for comment.After this article was published, Scarborough posted a series of tweets accusing CNN of lying about him.  Your sources are wrong,  he wrote. Scarborough did not explicitly deny that he visited Trump s hotel room, however.Undermining Scarborough s denials, Trump greeted Scarborough on Morning Joe by saying  it was great  seeing them the previous evening. Oops.While it s a wonder that anyone would support a guy like Trump, Scarborough s fixation isn t entirely out of left field. Despite his posturing as a  moderate  Republican, he s provided plenty of evidence to suggest a war-mongering, egomaniac like Trump would get him hot and bothered. When a group of U.S. soldiers accidentally floated into Iranian waters and were briefly detained, Scarborough shot off a series of embarrassing tweets that advocated for a president who was willing to start a world war over it.Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016(Obama didn t take his advice. Instead, he got the sailors released in less than 24 hours by diplomacy. No shots were fired.)Scarborough has flirted with supporting Trump for too long. To maintain any credibility at all, he needs to either openly admit he s backing the racist buffoon or clarify why he feels so invested in helping him win the election. Hotel visits, late-night debate prep calls, endless soft interviews on his show, all of this is beginning to paint a pretty clear picture. It s not a good one.Featured image: Screenshot",News,"February 10, 2016"
"US Delta Force Begins Targeting ISIS in Iraq, Threatens ‘Unilateral Operations in Syria’","21st Century Wire says While you were watching the presidential reality show, the Pentagon was busy putting boots back on the ground in Iraq and threatening to invade Syria.Watch a video of this report here: CNN reports that the unit has been  setting up safe houses, establishing informant networks and coordinating operations with Iraqi and Peshmerga units  in the past few weeks.Defence Secretary Ash Carter said: The only thing I ll say is the Expeditionary Targeting Force (Delta) is in position, it is having an effect and operating, and I expect it to be a very effective part of our acceleration campaign, Carter explained that the deployment of special forces was to make ISIS  fear that anywhere, anytime, it may be struck. Delta Force is 200-men strong in Iraq, and will be carrying out raids on targets, recovering hostages, eliminating terrorist commanders and gathering intelligence from enemy locations.Carter also said: This force will also be in a position to conduct unilateral operations in Syria. What Carter is really saying is that Delta Force may be used illegally in Syria, as they have no mandate from the sovereign Syrian government, or the UN for that matter, to conduct any operations at all on Syrian territory.Some might even say this is an American threat to invade Syria.Russian actions, on the other hand, are absolutely legal under international law, as they are fully sanctioned by the Syrian government.Earlier this week we learned that the Russian special forces unit Spetznaz was infiltrating ISIS with undercover operatives, which enabled airstrikes to hit within just three meters of their targets.Do you think Delta Force will have a real effect on the fight against ISIS?GET THE FULL STORY ON THE SYRIAN CRISIS: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",US_News,"March 3, 2016"
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING CONSERVATIVES WANT TO HEAR THIS GUY SAY TODAY…," I m leaving the GOP and running as a Democrat!Unfortunately, it doesn t look like that s what we re going to hear from our amnesty loving RINO (Republican In Name Only) friend.Reporting from Washington Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina defense hawk, plans to enter the crowded Republican presidential primary field Monday with a campaign that probably won t deliver him to the White House, but will highlight the party s divide over national security.Graham lacks the big-money backing and name recognition that s likely to be needed to pull away from the party s increasingly unwieldy field.But for him, that may not matter.For the last several years, Graham, a former Air Force colonel and legal officer, has played a central role in a sometimes-bitter battle between the GOP s traditional defense advocates and newly emergent isolationist-leaning libertarians led by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also seeking the party s presidential nomination. The South Carolina senator did not originate the  wacko birds  label for Paul and his allies   that was coined by Graham s best friend in Congress, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)   but he might as well have.Last week Graham was caught on camera rolling his eyes as Paul objected to Senate efforts to continue the National Security Agency s once-secret collection of records of Americans  telephone calls.Paul returned the favor by releasing a video denouncing the NSA program. It ridiculed both Graham and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for their support of NSA surveillance, depicting Graham as trying to read Americans  emails while sitting in a 1997-era car.In an interview during the heat of the Senate debate, Paul also accused Graham, McCain and other Republicans who support arming insurgents in Syria of having contributed to the rise of Islamic State, also referred to as ISIS. ISIS exists and grew stronger because of the hawks in our party, who gave arms indiscriminately, and most of those arms were snatched up by ISIS,  he said.Graham said in an email to supporters that his  presidential announcement will be one of the biggest and most memorable moments of my life. As he approaches the military s mandatory retirement age and eyes the White House, Graham said last week he was retiring from the Air Force after nearly 30 years. He had continued to serve as a reserve officer, at times using his skills as a military lawyer to handle legal affairs in Iraq during breaks from the Senate.A Southern Baptist and conservative on social issues, Graham, who never married, is known as a deal-maker in Congress. In 2013, he led efforts with Democrats to reform immigration laws to allow a path to citizenship for those living illegally in the U.S.Graham, 59, was born in Seneca, S.C., and lived with his family behind their liquor store, restaurant and pool hall on Main Street in Central, S.C., where he plans to announce his campaign.His personal story has helped shape his policymaking. After his parents  death, he helped raise his younger sister and has championed the Social Security survivors  benefits they relied upon as young people.But it is his military service and alliance with McCain that have come to define much of Graham s work in Washington as the two tried to defend hawkish foreign and defense policies against attack from some in the party s new generation. Now, he ll try to bolster those policies on the presidential campaign trail.Via: Virginia Gazette",politics,"Jun 1, 2015"
 Oklahoma GOP Just Took Their War On Women To A Whole New Level Of Crazy,"Republicans in Oklahoma just took their war on women and placed it on the doorsteps on doctors in the state.Late Thursday evening, the House of Representatives in the state, overwhelmingly approved a Senate bill that could revoke the licenses of doctors if they perform an abortion. Yahoo News reported:In the Republican-dominated legislature, the state s House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a Senate bill late on Thursday. Governor Mary Fallin, a Republican, has not yet indicated whether she will sign it.Under the bill, doctors who perform abortions would risk losing their medical licenses. Exemptions would be given for those who perform the procedure for reasons including protecting the mother or removing a miscarried fetus.According to the author of the bill, Senator Nathan Dahm, the bill was necessary because, This is our proper function, to protect life.  Republicans often say that they are protecting life when they interfere with a woman s right to choose, but the reality is that they are just pandering to the religious nuts in their voting base.As I have said a million times before, if the GOP was even a little bit  pro-life  they would do absolutely everything they could to prevent unwanted pregnancies. This means they would make sure that children were given a comprehensive education about sex; they oppose that. Republicans would also make sure that birth control (all forms) were easily available to women and men; they oppose that. If these imbeciles were pro-life, they would want to make sure all children were fed; they oppose foodstamps. Pro-lifers would also make sure that kids had medical care, even if their parents can t afford to pay for it; they oppose Medicaid expansion. Finally, if the right were actually pro-life, they would never send our kids off to die in their wars, bomb families in the Middle East, and they certainly would not support the death penalty; and yet, they do all of those things.This bill in Oklahoma bans abortion, make no mistake about that. And it doesn t ban it because the right loves babies and respects human life. It bans abortion because the right hates women and they especially hate when women have sex. It bans abortion because the GOP wants to punish  whores  who open their legs and it lets men off without any ramifications.This is just another way for men to exert their power over women. Fortunately, for the women in Oklahoma, if the female governor of the state decides to side with the right-wing jackasses in her party and sign the bill into law, it is completely unconstitutional and will never hold up in court.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2016"

 The Donald Trump Campaign Is Getting Out The Vote – For Democrats,"Now that Donald Trump has more or less sealed the Republican nomination, Democrats see a very real possibility that he could be president and that is scaring people to death. Thanks to Trump, last minute Democratic voter registrations in California are up   way up.In the first three months of the year, California added 1.5 million new voters through the end of April   double the number of new voters added during the same time period in 2012. And the total number of registered Democrats increased by nearly 100,000 people between the beginning of January and the beginning of April   compared to a gain of just 15,000 registered Republicans, according to an analysis from Political Data Inc., a California-based voting analytics firm. What s interesting is that the upticks have been greatest among Democrats and Latinos on those days where Donald Trump is kind of dominating the conversation,  said Mitchell, a former Democratic consultant who has analyzed California voter registration from day to day and by party affiliation since January.Source: PoliticoOf course, this is bluer than blue California. Trump won t win the Golden State, but the state is heavily Latino, and that could mean a lot for the general election in November. In fact, it reflects a pattern that s been happening throughout the primaries.While Republican turnout is at an all time high, Democrats have been almost as busy:Turnout has nearly been just as intense on the Democratic side, where 11.7 percent of eligible voters have cast their ballots, the highest percentage since 1992 other than the year Barack Obama was first elected president in 2008.Several media outlets have recently reported large swaths of legal Hispanic citizens are registering to vote in swing states across the country with the express purpose of casting their ballots against the unapologetic Trump. The outspoken New York real estate magnate launched his campaign by deriding Mexican immigrants as killers and rapists. We ve seen more people this year that want to become citizens and specifically because they want to vote against Trump,  said Mi Familia Vota executive director Ben Monterroso, whose group is among those leading a nationwide effort aimed at getting more Latinos to the polls.Source: Latin PostThe Latino vote represents more than 1/6 of the entire voting populace. Latinos are also the fastest growing demographic in the country. Even before Trump called all Mexicans  rapists  or blathered on about his  big, beautiful wall,  that he would have Mexico pay for, the Republican Party has been on the losing end of the electoral sea change. The last time a Republican wont the majority of the Latino vote was in 2004, and that was George W. Bush, who spoke Span(gl)ish and said he d prioritize comprehensive immigration reform. Yes, George W. Bush was a disastrous president, but his immigration stance was still much better than Trump s.The reality is, that without the Latino vote (yes, he did win the Latino vote in Nevada, but only the very small Republican Latino vote. The vast majority of Nevada Latinos are Democrats), Trump has a very tough road ahead of him: There is no president that can get the White House without having the Latino vote,  Mr. Monterroso told the Latin Post.  You have key states that without the Latino support, the candidate is not going to win, and if those key states don t vote for the president   they re not going to make it. The data backs him up. By most political scientists  estimates, the eventual Republican nominee needs between 40 and 47 percent of the Latino vote to win in a general election.Still, there is a chance Trump could find an issue that appeals to enough Latinos that he could siphon off a few votes from the Democratic nominee. It s doubtful he ll win the Latino vote anywhere, but he doesn t have to win it. He needs about 40 percent of the Latino vote. Is that possible? Well, Romney received 23 percent in 2012 and he wasn t anywhere near as divisive. If California, and the primary so far, are any indication, things look good for the Democratic nominee, assuming the party isn t too divided.Featured image via David McNew at Getty Images.

PARENTS OUTRAGED! FEMALE TEACHERS Get Into Major Brawl In Classroom…Terrified Students Scream In Horror [Video],"A Georgia middle school science teacher and a paraprofessional got into a vicious classroom brawl   in front of horrified students who captured the fight on video. The two women, who have not been identified, started throwing punches at one another May 19 at Stone Mountain Middle School. From what I think I know the teachers were arguing about a teacher, a male teacher, and they started arguing and it went on for about three to five minutes,  a student told the network.  Everyone was screaming like stop, stop, stop. Cellphone video shows one of the women repeatedly punching the other in the face as two students try to break up the fight, to no avail.The brawl eventually was broken up by school staff.The school sent a letter home to parents saying two women had  engaged in a physical altercation that caused a major disturbance in a classroom  and that both would be disciplined. The interaction and conduct in the video is completely unacceptable and contrary to our district s tenets and core principles,  school officials said in a statement.  Those staff members that participated in the conduct have been removed from the learning environment. Both women were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct in a public place.Shokingly, they will be allowed to keep their jobs pending the outcome of the school district s investigation.",left-news,"May 24, 2017"

And America wants the damn wall that we ve been promised for 40 years. Trump will deliver.The haters continue to claim Trump is no conservative  but his policies are conservative as hell which leads me to the following conclusion. Considering Trump s undeniably conservative policies  in conjunction with his unparalleled business successes  and add the fact that he has lived his life in a WILDLY liberal Manhattan, I conclude that Trump has always been a closet conservative.A businessman has to make friends to succeed.We d like to thank Intellectual Froglegs for the awesome mention in his latest video.

In other words, they were pretending to ask tough questions on the spot but Trump was able to form an answer in advance, thereby making himself look good.Kelly did not name names but one pro-Trump host is already objecting.Naturally, fellow Fox host Sean Hannity went on the defensive on Twitter and demonstrated that he has never heard the old quote in Hamlet about protesting too much.Hannity demanded to know which hosts Kelly was talking about and strenuously insisted that he isn t one of them.No idea who @megynkelly is talking about.

 Court Documents Show How Trump Cooked The Books And Scammed Investors,"Court documents show deceptive behavior by Donald Trump s company that is part of a pattern for the Republican presidential nominee. The company behind a Trump construction project   a taxpayer-financed project to convert the Old Post Office Building in Washington D.C. into a luxury hotel   made up two sets of financial books, deceiving investors.Lenders were told the hotel could earn millions of dollars more than the more conservative, internal estimates, the financial analyst, Raymond Flores, testified. He said those internal projections  generally tend to err on the side of being pretty conservative. Later he said,  And then there are other projections where, you know, we re pitching to a lender or an equity source, where it s rosier.  With these projections, he said,  we re pushing the boundaries of   we re pushing ranges of reasonability at those   at those projections to show, you know, what the hotel could be. As Trump s finances have been probed during his election run, time and time again his companies have been shown misleading and deceiving, with Trump benefiting as others lose their shirts.His Trump University took in thousands, as many customers claimed they did not receive the real estate education they were promised. As a result, attorneys general opened investigations and the company closed its doors.Another Trump enterprise, building condominiums in Baja California, went belly-up as investors were told that Trump and his children were buying in   they weren t.Trump s casino in Atlantic City also failed, while other casinos were doing well and thriving. Trump, again, made a bag of money and left investors holding on to the business  debts and obligations.Time and again Trump has shown that he uses his name and brand to paint a picture for people interested in investing, but it has often been nothing more substantial than smoke and mirrors. This time he has even gone so far as to involve tax dollars.The pattern continues.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 13, 2016"
THE ULTIMATE COMMUNITY ORGANIZER: IS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD TOO WHITE? IS IT TOO RICH? Obama Plans To ‘Fix’ Them Using Government to Force Diversity,"Of course, the government will have to address that whole income inequality issue, because clearly every illegal alien or  underprivileged  American doesn t have the financial means to live in the wealthier communities or suburbs. Socialism is here, and unless we find someone in Congress willing to stand up to this  president, everything Americans have worked so hard for will likely be taken away by government force This is what you get when you put a community organizer in the White House   he tries to reorganize your community from Washington.Apparently, President Obama thinks your neighborhood may not be inclusive enough, so he has instructed his Department of Housing and Urban Development to issue a new rule called Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which is designed to force communities to diversify.According to the Obama administration, in too many neighborhoods  housing choices continue to be constrained through housing discrimination, the operation of housing markets, [and] investment choices by holders of capital.  (Yes, that is a quote from an actual HUD document, not a bad undergraduate thesis on Karl Marx.)Under Obama s proposed rule, the federal government will collect massive amounts of data on the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic makeup of thousands of local communities, looking for signs of  disparities by race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability in access to community assets.  Then the government will target communities with results it doesn t like and use billions of dollars in federal grant money to bribe or blackmail them into changing their zoning and housing policies.This is not about blocking housing discrimination, which has been illegal since 1968. It is unlawful for someone to deny you a loan or prevent you from buying a home because of your race, creed or color. Socioeconomic status is   and ought to be   another matter. If you want to buy a nice house in the suburbs, you have to be able to afford it. Apparently, Obama thinks that s unfair discrimination by the  holders of capital. Putting decisions about how local communities are run in the hands of federal bureaucrats is an assault on freedom. Local autonomy is essential to liberty. As Milton Friedman put it in  Capitalism and Freedom,   If I don t like what my local community does, be it in sewage disposal, zoning or schools, I can move to another local community. . . . If I don t like what my state does, I can move to another. If I do not like what Washington imposes, I have few alternatives in this world of jealous nations.  Washington has no business imposing decisions about zoning and housing policies on thousands of local communities.The proposed rule could become an issue in the presidential race. HUD Secretary Julian Castro, the man assigned to implement this new policy, is on everyone s shortlist to be Hillary Clinton s running mate. Moreover, as National Review s Stanley Kurtz points out, collecting all the data will take time   which means decisions about how to use that data will be up to the next president, whoever that turns out to be.Local communities across the United States will be up in arms over this rule   and rightly so. The federal government should have no say over whether your neighborhood is too Jewish, or too Caucasian, or has too many married couples. But Republicans need to be very careful. Democrats want the GOP to rail against this rule and see it as an opportunity to paint the Republicans as the party that wants to protect the wealthy, white suburbs and keep out poor people of color.Conservatives need to make this absolutely clear: We believe Americans of all races, colors and creeds should be free to live wherever they want. And we want to help them do so by unleashing economic opportunity for those at the bottom so that more Americans can get better educations and better jobs and ultimately move to better neighborhoods.Under Obama, those opportunities have been disappearing for Americans at the bottom of our economy. While he talks a good game about inequality, the poor have gotten poorer while the rich have gotten richer on Obama s watch. During the Obama recovery, Americans in the top 5 percent of households (those with average incomes of more than $320,000) were the only group in the United States to see incomes rise from 2009 to 2013. Meanwhile, those worst hit were in the bottom 20 percent, who saw their real incomes fall by 7 percent on average. As American Enterprise Institute President Arthur C. Brooks explains ,  Our putatively progressive president has inadvertently executed a plutocratic tour de force. Having Washington micromanage the housing and zoning policies of thousands of local communities is not going to change this. The answer is not to force local governments to build affordable housing in affluent communities. The answer is to restore upward mobility in the United States so that more people can afford housing in affluent communities.Via: Washington Post ",Government News,"Jun 18, 2015"
 Donald Trump Tells Veterans That He’s Just As Brave As Them Because He’s Rich (VIDEO),"I am not a psychologist. I don t even play one on TV, but after more than a year of hearing non-stop Donald Trump verbal vomit, it s pretty clear that the man is incapable of not insulting people, even the people this country pretends to revere, like veterans. On Thursday, Trump, for not the first time, insulted a group of his military veteran supporters by saying that he s just as brave as them because he takes financial risks (he doesn t, but more on that in a bit).He started off right, for literally a fraction of a second:With five days to go until Election Day, we almost had a late-breaking campaign first: Donald Trump being self-deprecating. Speaking at a rally in North Carolina Thursday night, Trump acknowledged Medal of Honor recipients in attendance.  Oh, they re so much more brave than me. I wouldn t have done what they did,  Trump said. So far so good.  I m brave in other ways,  Trump continued.  I m brave.  Just different brave. Same same.Source: SlateWatch it here:Okay, Mr. Trump, since you brought up bravery, let s talk about it. You had five draft deferments, officially making you a draft dodger and if your campaign rhetoric is any indication, you re also a chicken hawk. Sending other people to die, so you can  bravely  amass your personal fortune is the opposite of bravery. It s cowardly and it s worse.As for being  financially brave,  hardly. He s  brave  with OPM, other people s money, which is not bravery at all.It s called OPM. I do it all the time in business. It s called other people s money. There s nothing like doing things with other people s money because it takes the risk   you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk.Source: BloombergTrump has also filed bankruptcy numerous times, which means he s really irresponsible with other people s money. Why should we expect him to be any different as Commander-in-Chief. He will send other people s children to fight wars that could quite easily bankrupt us. To Trump, that would be just another day. To the rest of the country, it would be devastating.Despite all of this, despite the fact that Trump has insulted prisoners of war, veterans with PTSD, Gold Star families, and the very sacrifices of veterans, the military still supports him, although, by and large, the people in charge do not. Perhaps the military should be listening to its generals and admirals instead of a bloated draft dodger.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 4, 2016"
JUSTICE SCALIA Found Dead With ‘Pillow Over His Head’…Why No Autopsy?,"It was just announced that there will be no autopsy of Justice Scalia after he was found dead in his room of  natural causes . Does anyone else out there think it should be mandatory for an autopsy to be performed? Since Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead in his resort hotel room at Cibolo Creek Creek Ranch on Saturday, questions have been flying about the immediate declaration of  natural causes  as the means of death.According to the ranch owner, Scalia was described as  animated and engaged  during dinner Friday night. He was one of three dozen invitees to an event unrelated to law or politics.Yet just hours later, after missing both breakfast and lunch, he was found dead of apparent natural causes. Later, media outlets reported he had suffered a heart attack.Houston businessman John Poindexter, who owns the 30,000-acre luxury ranch, recalled:  He was seated near me and I had a chance to observe him. He was very entertaining. But about 9 p.m. he said,  It s been a long day and a long week, I want to get some sleep. Poindexter knocked on Scalia s door about 8:30 the next morning. The door was locked and the judge did not answer. Three hours later, Poindexter returned from an outing and determined Scalia was still missing. We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled,  said Poindexter. He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap,  he said.Scalia did not have a pulse and his body was cold, and after consulting with a doctor at a hospital in Alpine, Poindexter concluded resuscitation would have been futile. He then contacted federal authorities, at first encountering a series of answering services because he was calling on a weekend. Ultimately they became available and handled it superbly,  he said.  They flew in by helicopter. They told me to secure the ranch, which I did until this morning. Scalia s body was moved to an El Paso funeral home early Sunday, then driven from Marfa and arrived around 2:30 a.m. at Sunset Funeral Homes, according to spokesman Chris Lujan.Read more: wnd",Government News,"Feb 14, 2016"
5 FACTS The Media Won’t Tell You About Cops Killing Blacks [VIDEO],"Scholar and journalist Heather Mac Donald toiled away early on in her career at liberal enclaves, but through her street-level reporting on social services and the police, her worldview shifted away from liberal-progressive to conservative.Her shift  was not some kind of epiphany from reading conservative principles,  but by hearing the voices of welfare recipients who told her  government aid becomes a narcotic. Her latest book,  The War On Cops  is now available for purchase. In her book, she outlines the false narrative that is being pushed by Black Lives Matter and the leftist media that law enforcement officers are  Out to get Blacks  in America.For almost two years, a protest movement known as  Black Lives Matter  has convulsed the nation. Triggered by the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement holds that racist police officers are the greatest threat facing young black men today. This belief has triggered riots,  die-ins,  the murder and attempted murder of police officers, a campaign to eliminate traditional grand jury proceedings when police use lethal force, and a presidential task force on policing.Even though the U.S. Justice Department has resoundingly disproven the lie that a pacific Michael Brown was shot in cold blood while trying to surrender, Brown is still venerated as a martyr. And now police officers are backing off of proactive policing in the face of the relentless venom directed at them on the street and in the media. As a result, violent crime is on the rise.The need is urgent, therefore, to examine the Black Lives Matter movement s central thesis that police pose the greatest threat to young black men. I propose two counter hypotheses: first, that there is no government agency more dedicated to the idea that black lives matter than the police; and second, that we have been talking obsessively about alleged police racism over the last 20 years in order to avoid talking about a far larger problem black-on-black crime.Let s be clear at the outset: police have an indefeasible obligation to treat everyone with courtesy and respect, and to act within the confines of the law. Too often, officers develop a hardened, obnoxious attitude. It is also true that being stopped when you are innocent of any wrongdoing is infuriating, humiliating, and sometimes terrifying. And needless to say, every unjustified police shooting of an unarmed civilian is a stomach-churning tragedy.Given the history of racism in this country and the complicity of the police in that history, police shootings of black men are particularly and understandably fraught. That history informs how many people view the police. But however intolerable and inexcusable every act of police brutality is, and while we need to make sure that the police are properly trained in the Constitution and in courtesy, there is a larger reality behind the issue of policing, crime, and race that remains a taboo topic. The problem of black-on-black crime is an uncomfortable truth, but unless we acknowledge it, we won t get very far in understanding patterns of policing. ImprimusHere are 5 indisputable facts that prove this narrative to be one big LIE:1. Cops killed nearly twice as many whites as blacks in 2015. According to data compiled by The Washington Post, 50 percent of the victims of fatal police shootings were white, while 26 percent were black. The majority of these victims had a gun or  were armed or otherwise threatening the officer with potentially lethal force,  according to Mac Donald in a speech at Hillsdale College.Some may argue that these statistics are evidence of racist treatment toward blacks, since whites consist of 62 percent of the population and blacks make up 13 percent of the population. But as Mac Donald writes in The Wall Street Journal, 2009 statistics from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reveal that blacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties. Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officers  own risk of using lethal force,  writes MacDonald.2. More whites and Hispanics die from police homicides than blacks. According to Mac Donald, 12 percent of white and Hispanic homicide deaths were due to police officers, while only four percent of black homicide deaths were the result of police officers. If we re going to have a  Lives Matter  anti-police movement, it would be more appropriately named  White and Hispanic Lives Matter,'  said Mac Donald in her Hillsdale speech.3. The Post s data does show that unarmed black men are more likely to die by the gun of a cop than an unarmed white man but this does not tell the whole story. In August 2015, the ratio was seven-to-one of unarmed black men dying from police gunshots compared to unarmed white men; the ratio was six-to-one by the end of 2015. But Mac Donald points out in The Marshall Project that looking at the details of the actual incidents that occurred paints a different picture:The  unarmed  label is literally accurate, but it frequently fails to convey highly-charged policing situations. In a number of cases, if the victim ended up being unarmed, it was certainly not for lack of trying. At least five black victims had reportedly tried to grab the officer s gun, or had been beating the cop with his own equipment. Some were shot from an accidental discharge triggered by their own assault on the officer. And two individuals included in the Post s  unarmed black victims  category were struck by stray bullets aimed at someone else in justified cop shootings. If the victims were not the intended targets, then racism could have played no role in their deaths.In one of those unintended cases, an undercover cop from the New York Police Department was conducting a gun sting in Mount Vernon, just north of New York City. One of the gun traffickers jumped into the cop s car, stuck a pistol to his head, grabbed $2,400 and fled. The officer gave chase and opened fire after the thief again pointed his gun at him. Two of the officer s bullets accidentally hit a 61-year-old bystander, killing him. That older man happened to be black, but his race had nothing to do with his tragic death. In the other collateral damage case, Virginia Beach, Virginia, officers approached a car parked at a convenience store that had a homicide suspect in the passenger seat. The suspect opened fire, sending a bullet through an officer s shirt. The cops returned fire, killing their assailant as well as a woman in the driver s seat. That woman entered the Post s database without qualification as an  unarmed black victim  of police fire.Mac Donald examines a number of other instances, including unarmed black men in San Diego, CA and Prince George s County, MD attempting to reach for a gun in a police officer s holster. In the San Diego case, the unarmed black man actually  jumped the officer  and assaulted him, and the cop shot the man since he was  fearing for his life.  MacDonald also notes that there was an instance in 2015 where  three officers were killed with their own guns, which the suspects had wrestled from them. 4. Black and Hispanic police officers are more likely to fire a gun at blacks than white officers. This is according to a Department of Justice report in 2015 about the Philadelphia Police Department, and is further confirmed that by a study conducted University of Pennsylvania criminologist Greg Ridgeway in 2015 that determined black cops were 3.3 times more likely to fire a gun than other cops at a crime scene.5. Blacks are more likely to kill cops than be killed by cops. This is according to FBI data, which also found that 40 percent of cop killers are black. According to Mac Donald, the police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black than a cop killing an unarmed black person.Despite the facts, the anti-police rhetoric of Black Lives Matter and their leftist sympathizers have resulted in what Mac Donald calls the  Ferguson Effect,  as murders have spiked by 17 percent among the 50 biggest cities in the U.S. as a result of cops being more reluctant to police neighborhoods out of fear of being labeled as racists. Additionally, there have been over twice as many cops victimized by fatal shootings in the first three months of 2016. -Via: Daily Wire Watch Heather MacDonald explain how the lies the media and the Left are pushing about cops targeting Blacks will ultimately harm Black communities:Here is Heather MacDonald s speech at Hillsdale College in its entirety:",politics,"Sep 15, 2016"
WATCH: UNCOVERED VIDEO REVEALS Dan Rather Saying Americans Are Bored With Bill Clinton Rape Story…Want To “Move On” To The Next Thing,"In one of his regular appearances on the Imus In The Morning radio show, Dan Rather was asked by Imus in 1999, if he had any idea why NBC News was sitting on the story about the rape charges against Bill Clinton by Juanita Broaddrick?   Rather responded that the reason they were  sitting on the story  was  pretty obvious.  First, Rather clarified that they don t call to tell him why or why not they choose to hide a story from their news channel, but suggested:  I think it s pretty obvious that they re nervous about, number one, whether this information is accurate, whether it s really true or not. And number two, even if it does turn out to be true, it happened a long time ago, and number three, they ve got to be figuring that maybe, just maybe the American public has heard all that they want to hear about it and they re saying,  next , let s move on to the next thing. Imus went on to say that he read an article in either the leftist propaganda Newsweek or Time magazine that  even the woman herself, Juanita Broaddrick said she hoped that this thing went away this week, and even she was sick of hearing about it, [Dan Rather interrupted Imus with laughter] and it s her story.  Dan Rather then busted out in laughter and agreed, saying,  Well let s hope she gets her way with that.  More laughter Imus then revealed that  Someone from NBC News told me that she wasn t clear about when exactly this thing happened, but then her son called me and he s an attorney someplace, in, I guess in Arkansas, and he wanted me to know, why he called me god knows, but he wanted me to know that that was not the case, that she knows exactly what it was, and there was some other reason they were sitting on it. Instead of responding to Imus  comments, Rather deflected by making an embarrassing play to stroke Imus  ego and distract him from the reason NBC hiding the Clinton rape story. Rather continued,  But I just don t know if this is going anywhere, you know, I d have to bet for the moment that it isn t. The Washington Post gave it a pretty good ride on Saturday, and there wasn t much pick up from it. So unless there s some new and sensational information developed out of it, my guess is that it probably dribbles away. ",politics,"Nov 17, 2017"

“BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS” FOR VOTING RIGHTS: The Truth About Shocking Number Of Murders By Illegal Aliens In US Hidden By Media And Dems [VIDEO],"It s time to stop hitting the snooze button America! This crisis is no longer on our doorstep it s here. The Democrats, corporations and the Chamber of Commerce want to give these criminals the same rights as you and me Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump deserves credit for forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration, but it is not  Trump s issue.  We will be making a fatal mistake if we let the media discuss it that way.As Ann Coulter has pointed out, this is the most critical issue of the 2016 race because this is the issue that will define whether or not there will even be an American nation recognizable as the  home of the free and land of the brave. But illegal immigration is not  Ann Coulter s issue  any more than it is  Tom Tancredo s issue.  It is America s issue   not only because it will define America in the 21st Century but because it also defines American elections and who will be voting in elections in 2020 and beyond. It also illuminates the power of the mainstream media to keep issues off the national stage.Think of illegal immigration this way: If the liberal media can keep illegal alien crime out of the  kitchen table debate,  they can keep any issue out of the debate. And they will if they can get away with it. For those reasons, illegal immigration is much more than an issue of public policy; it is the poster child for media malpractice.The media s attempt to suppress public awareness over illegal alien crime and the effects of illegal immigration on American workers  jobs and wages is nothing less than censorship on a massive scale. We need to start talking about it in those terms and hold the media accountable for the lack of ethical standards.The mainstream media   including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal   are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco exposed only the tip of a massive iceberg, and the media establishment is desperate to avoid dealing with the iceberg underneath.Let s look at a few numbers. You haven t seen them in the New York Times, Atlanta Constitution, or the Miami Herald, nor have they been featured on NBC Nightly news or CNN. So, the average American is blissfully unaware of them.Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34% and Arizona 17.8%. During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states. That 38% represents 7,085 murders out of the total of 18,643. That 5.6% figure for the average illegal alien population in those five states comes from US Census estimates. We know the real number is double that official estimate. Yet, even if it is 11%, it is still shameful that the percentage of murders by criminal aliens is more than triple the illegal population in those states.Those astounding numbers were compiled by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) using official Department of Justice data on criminal aliens in the nation s correctional system. The numbers were the basis for a presentation at a recent New Hampshire conference sponsored by the highly respected Center for Security Policy. You can view the full presentation here:The federal Bureau of Prisons category  criminal aliens  includes legal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, but over 90% of incarcerated criminal aliens are illegal aliens, so it is reasonable to use these numbers as a close approximation of the extent of illegal alien crime.Similar data is available at the state level if state officials have the desire to look for it. The Texas Department of Public Safety reports that between 2008 and 2014, 35% of the all murder convictions were illegal aliens averaging 472 murders each year from 2004 to 2008.Do you know the numbers for your state? Does your congressman, Senator, or Governor know those numbers? Of course not. If you are afraid of the answer, don t ask the question.There is widespread public ignorance of illegal alien crime in every state because the mainstream media does investigate such matters. Why? Because they do not want the public to think about such things. The media, from the Associated Press down to the Main Street News, does not even allow the phrase  illegal immigrant  to appear in print.So, the numbers are out there in the criminal justice system and correctional institutions, waiting to be compiled and published. State attorneys general and state legislators could access the data if they were interested, and so could the media, but they don t. In fact, in Colorado in 2006, the state legislature passed a law ordering the state Attorney General to compile accurate data on the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and send a bill for reimbursement to the federal government. The state AG sent the feds a bill for only half the real costs   the cost of inmates in the state prison system and not the costs imposed on taxpayers by an equal number of inmates in county jails across the state.The US Department of Justice s Bureau of Justice Programs publishes an annual report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a report that includes data on the number of criminal aliens incarcerated each state prison system and each county jail. It takes some prodigious digging to find the data, but it is there.But our mainstream media, our self-described guardians of the First Amendment, consciously avoids the effort and declines to put a public spotlight on the problem or demand public scrutiny and public accountability. Why?The answer is that public debate on the problem of illegal alien crime does not serve the progressive political agenda. The issue is swept under the rug and anyone who raises it is called a racist.This is media malpractice of historic proportions, and publishers and editors are the unindicted coconspirators in those 7,085 murders.",left-news,"Aug 9, 2015"
"NOT SO FUNNY GUY, Liberal WILL FERRELL Makes Movie Mocking Ronald Reagan’s Alzheimer’s…Reagan’s Daughter Has A Few Choice Words For Him","What s next Making a comedy at the Humane Society about euthanizing pets?  Patti Davis, daughter of late President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan, penned a moving open letter to actor Will Ferrell on Thursday criticizing his involvement in an upcoming comedic film that will satirize President Reagan s tragic battle with Alzheimer s disease.The film, based on a 2015 Black List script, centers on a fictional story in which President Reagan begins suffering from dementia shortly after a landslide reelection victory in 1984. A young aide must convince Reagan that he is an actor playing the President in a movie.Ferrell is attached to play Reagan in the film and will produce it under his Gary Sanchez Productions banner.Here is the letter Patty Davis penned to Ferrell:Dear Mr. Ferrell,I saw the news bulletin   as did everyone   that you intend to portray my father in the throes of Alzheimer s for a comedy that you are also producing. Perhaps you have managed to retain some ignorance about Alzheimer s and other versions of dementia. Perhaps if you knew more, you would not find the subject humorous.Alzheimer s doesn t care if you are President of the United States or a dockworker. It steals what is most precious to a human being   memories, connections, the familiar landmarks of a lifetime that we all come to rely on to hold our place secure in this world and keep us linked to those we have come to know and love. I watched as fear invaded my father s eyes   this man who was never afraid of anything. I heard his voice tremble as he stood in the living room and said,  I don t know where I am.  I watched helplessly as he reached for memories, for words, that were suddenly out of reach and moving farther away. For ten long years he drifted   past the memories that marked his life, past all that was familiar and mercifully, finally past the fear.There was laughter in those years, but there was never humor.Alzheimer s is the ultimate pirate, pillaging a person s life and leaving an empty landscape behind. It sweeps up entire families, forcing everyone to claw their way through overwhelming grief, confusion, helplessness, and anger. Perhaps for your comedy you would like to visit some dementia facilities. I have   I didn t find anything comedic there, and my hope would be that if you re a decent human being, you wouldn t either.Twice a week I run a support group called Beyond Alzheimer s for caregivers and family members of those with Alzheimer s and dementia. I look into haunted eyes that remind me of my own when my father was ill. I listen to stories of helplessness and loss and am continually moved by the bravery of those who wake up every morning not knowing who their loved one will be that day, or what will be lost. The only certainty with Alzheimer s is that more will be lost and the disease will always win in the end.Perhaps you would like to explain to them how this disease is suitable material for a comedy.",politics,"Apr 28, 2016"

It s just another lie she s been living, on top of a million other lies.

SENATOR WANTS ANSWERS ON MISSING TSA BADGES AFTER TSA TRIES TO BLOCK INVESTIGATION,"This is a big deal and should be investigated. How did the TSA badges go missing? Senator Thune is right in pushing on this but who knows if they even have an answer for him Senator John Thune fired off a blistering letter to TSA officials demanding answers regarding missing, lost or stolen SIDA (Secured Identification Display Area) badges that can be used by employees to gain access to secure areas at airports. Clearly there are an awful lot of things falling through the cracks and there s just no room for an error when it comes to this issue. We need answers. They re not providing them. Thune, who chairs the Transportation Committee, said previous answers from the agency had actually raised more questions than answers. The concern follows reports that more than 270 badges went missing at the San Diego International Airport in the last two years and more than 1,400 badges missing from Atlanta s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.Many of the missing badges were not reported for weeks or months in hopes they would be turned it   meaning they were not quickly deactivated. The information comes following an investigation by a an NBC affiliate in Dallas, TX. They also found reports of missing crew and pilot uniforms.When Atlanta reported the information to the TSA they said they never should have given out the information in the first place, but we ask, doesn t the public have a right to know?Read more: FOX News",Government News,"May 28, 2015"
 Watch The ‘Liberal Redneck’ Compare Anti-Trans Protesters To Michele Bachmann On Bath Salts,"Trae Crowder, known on YouTube as  The Liberal Redneck,  has returned again with yet another damned funny commentary on the recent creepy obsession that Republicans have with what people do in public restrooms.Crowder started by taking aim specifically at the new wave of idiots that are invading Target department stores, in order to loudly  protest  the fact they allow transgender people to use the restrooms in their department stores. One case in particular was one where a woman was walking up and down the aisles in target, towing along what appeared to be half of her 12 children she claimed to have.Sympathizing with the woman, in the comedic sense, he said he could understand how with 12 kids she was  crazier than Michelle Bachmann on bath salts.  You gotta agree with his logic. With 12 kids, and having to manage them in a militant Christian household that you KNOW she runs, she s probably crazier than an outhouse rat.Crowder is sick of hearing about how Republicans are going to  take their country back  as well, and suggested that they all move somewhere that religion and government are the same   like Saudi Arabia. Crowder said I know what you re thinking    Eww, they re brown, gross. But check it out: they love screaming, they hate books, they throw rocks at queers   you d fit right in.  What a great point. Right?Watch Trae completely own every person who can t stop thinking about people peeing below:Considering how many Republicans get caught doing bad hings in public rest rooms, you would think that they d be focusing more on their own party, instead of an entire segment of society that already lives in such fear of going to the bathroom they are in-and-out while drawing as little attention to themselves as possible.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"May 19, 2016"
 ‘We’re Getting Hammered’: GOP Lawmaker Feeling Pressure Over Obamacare Repeal (VIDEO),"Virginia Congressman Dave Brat is feeling the heat from his constituents, especially women. Republicans are moving to repeal Obamacare and his constituents are putting the pressure on him. Since Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,  he told a conservative audience at an event on Saturday.  They come up    When is your next town hall?  And believe me, it s not to give positive input. I had one woman on my Facebook say she was going to get up in my grill,  he said.  There s paid protesters   paid activists on the far left, not my Democratic friends I go to church with. They re being paid to go around and raise havoc. We re getting hammered,  Brat added.There is a Facebook page dedicated to the Virginia Republican which uses the hashtag #AskBrat so it doesn t appear that they re  paid. Karen Conley of Henrico County said she called Brat s office recently to express support for the Affordable Care Act, which keeps her family insured. Nobody is being paid or put up to this by an outside organization,  Conley said.  Everybody is putting in their time and effort because they re dissatisfied with the representation. They feel dismissed, and that their concerns aren t valid because they re not being responded to. It s not just a partisan issue anymore. Alsuin Preis, another of Brat s constituents, said many of the people who are trying to meet with the congressman had supported him during his campaign. This is not about going to a town hall about haranguing Dave Brat or just throwing out jabs,  Preis told WTVR-TV.  We want to discuss our concerns. Brat plans to hold town hall meetings after the first 100 days of the Donald Trump administration. Over the past couple of weeks my office has been inundated with phone calls, and emails and comments on social media requesting a town hall meeting, and believe me, I fully intend to have plenty of town halls that are open and transparent as soon as our first 100 days agenda is implemented and we come up for a breath of air,  Brat wrote on Facebook.Some of Brat s constituents are requesting a town hall meeting before the first 100 days of Trump s alleged presidency.Watch:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Dave Brat meets with District 1 at Hanover Tavern 1/28/17Thoughts?""When is the next Town Hall meeting?"" is not an accusation, it's a question.

 This Terrified Six-Year Old’s 911 Call Is Heartbreaking (VIDEO),"After her step-father began beating her mother, a terrified six-year-old child rushed to the phone to call for help.Through her hysterical sobs, she told the emergency dispatch worker that her  mommy and daddy are having a fight. As the worker tries to get more information, Lisa pleads with her to please send the police.  This has been going on forever and ever,  she sobs. A few moments later the little girl can be heard hysterically screaming at her step-father,  STOP IT! We can t see what s happening, but we can hear the anguish and terror in her voice as she begs the 911 operator to send help. He hurt mommy Can you just send the police please,  she cries.After the operator instructs her to go and unlock the door so the police can get into the house, the little girl returns to the phone.At this points we hear her scream  He just knocked my sister out,  then saying  My little sister. The-four-year-old. There s another scream,  OH MY GOD. He s got the baby. Listen to the heartbreaking call below, via FacesofChildAbuse on YouTube.  The recording, now known as the Lisa Tape, is used by agencies across the country to educate people on the impact that domestic violence on children.After listening to the call, I had to find out what happened to that little girl and her family.I found out that Lisa, her mom and her siblings made it out of the situation alive.Today, Lisa Floyd is an advocate for survivors of domestic violence.Sadly, many domestic violence stories do not have the same kind of happy ending this one does.Every nine seconds another woman living in the United States will be the target of violence from a husband, boyfriend or intimate partner. These attacks result in more than 2 million injuries to women and 1,300 deaths, annually.We know that every year at least 3.3 million children witness domestic violence in their homes.Like Lisa s younger siblings, children who live in homes where domestic violence occurs are as 1,500 times more likely to become the targets of abuse.According to the National Domestic Violence Center, 50 percent of men who engage in violence toward an intimate partner, also abuse their children.Yet sentences for perpetrators of domestic violence remain shamelessly lenient in the United States. For example, the minimum sentence for someone convicted of domestic violence in the state of California is probation. In Florida, it is five days in the county jail. In Louisiana it s four days, at least 48 hours of which must served without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.Even more shocking, the average prison sentence for a man who kills a spouse or intimate partner in the United States is two to six years.Is it any wonder that at least 60 percent of domestic violence perpetrators repeat the violent behavior?When you listen to Lisa s tape and hear the terror in her voice, or when you look at the shocking statistics that show us how many women and children suffer horrible acts of violence at the hands men like Lisa s step-father, and then you compare those things to the consequences that our society considers  reasonable,  it s nothing less than shameful.Domestic violence remains the leading cause of injury to women in the United States. It s also the number cause of homelessness for women in children in the United States.Those statistics aren t going to change until we stop letting the perpetrators off the hook with a slap on the wrist.*image credit: wikimedia commons ",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Major City SLAPS Greedy CEOs Like Trump With Tax Penalty To Fight Income Inequality,"This is HUGE news!The city council of Portland, Oregon just did something awesome that could actually reduce the income inequality gap.As we all know, CEO pay has gotten out of control over the last few decades. Some CEOs even make more than 100 times what their employees make. And some of those CEOs have the gall to whine that providing benefits, better wages, and healthcare to their employees is a waste of money.Well, if these greedy CEOs want to operate in Portland they ll have to pay an extra tax that could inspire other American cities to do the same thing.According to the Institute for Policy Studies,In a 3-1 vote, the council agreed to add a surtax on the city s existing business license tax for firms that pay their CEOs more than 100 times what their typical worker receives. This will be the nation s first tax penalty for extreme CEO-worker pay gaps.On how the tax will be levied and which companies will be affected, Truthout.org spoke to IPS co-editor Sarah Anderson, who explained that the city has already found over 500 companies that will see a rise in their taxes soon.Publicly traded companies with extreme pay gaps will pay a surtax on top of the city s current business license tax. The surtax will be 10 percent of the business tax liability for companies with a CEO-worker pay ratio of more than 100-to-1 and 25 percent for companies with a ratio of more than 250-to-1. The Portland government has identified more than 500 corporations that do enough business in the city to be affected by the surtax, including many that regularly dominate the highest-paid CEO lists, such as Oracle, Honeywell, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and General Electric.So once again, the fight on behalf of workers is centered in Oregon. Earlier this year, Oregon raised the minimum wage to nearly $15 an hour. Meanwhile, Donald Trump s cabinet is stacked with billionaires and his tax plan favors the top one percent.According to a Tax Policy Center chart posted to Twitter by Morning Joe economic wonk Steven Rattner, Trump s tax plan will give the top 0.1 percent a $1.1 million tax cut while the bottom 20 percent only get a cut of $110.Under Trump s plan, the top 0.1% get an avg tax cut of $1.1mm; the bottom 20% get only $110. My @Morning_Joe chart: pic.twitter.com/oQcZuALtPa  Steven Rattner (@SteveRattner) December 8, 2016And Trump has repeatedly claimed that the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is too high and had named a wealthy CEO and opponent of the fight for a $15 minimum wage as his Labor Secretary.Clearly, Trump intends to widen the income gap and punish workers while giving huge tax giveaways to his wealthy friends.But Portland, Oregon just slapped Trump across the face on behalf of workers everywhere and their strategy could be replicated in other cities across the country.Featured Image: Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"December 8, 2016"
 Adam Schiff SAVAGES Republicans For Canceling Hearing On Russia Collusion To Please Trump,"If you were unaware, there was a much-anticipated hearing on the collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence operatives during the election scheduled on Tuesday   key word  was. Because The Donald totally has nothing to hide at all, the GOP nixed those plans. The public hearing was to feature former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump for doing her job, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper   both of whom are figures Republicans do not want to allow near a microphone.Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff announced on Friday that Trump transition team member and chairman of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Rep. Devin Nunes canceled the hearing.BREAKING: Chairman just cancelled open Intelligence Committee hearing with Clapper, Brennan and Yates in attempt to choke off public info.

We strongly object to the cancellation of this hearing,  Schiff says.  We would still urge the majority to reconsider. The witnesses have made it clear to us they are still available and we would urge that that hearing be allowed to go forward. Recently, Nunes gave us a clear indicator that he is compromised when he ran directly to The Donald with alleged information showing that information regarding Trump and his team was perfectly legally incidentally collected while intelligence agencies were monitoring some pretty nasty people overseas. He did not share this information with his fellow Congressmen and women.There is no question now. There is no defense.

 NAACP: Bannon May Be Gone But Trump Is Still A Raging Bigot,"The NAACP issued a statement following the firing of Steve Bannon, Donald Trump s racist chief strategist, on Friday afternoon. The organization explained that while they are certainly glad to see Bannon go, it doesn t change the fact that the sitting president is still a raging bigot. The NAACP is glad to see Steve Bannon out of the White House,  Derrick Johnson, the group s interim president and CEO said in a statement. Ousting one key staffer, however, can t erase the words used by President Trump this week in defense of domestic terrorists, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. President Trump provided permission for these hate groups to exist. Bannon left his job at the right-wing propoganda site, Breitbart News, to sign on as Trump s campaign manager and then became the alleged president s chief strategist following the election. As a well known racist and anti-Semite, Bannon was widely accepted as the bigoted mastermind behind much of Trump s most racist rhetoric and policies.In the statement, the NAACP also called on Trump to fire the rest of  the people who share Steve Bannon s poisonous beliefs, including senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security aide Sebastian Gorka.Bannon s firing came after racial tensions in the U.S. reached a fevered pitch following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that left a counter-protester dead. Trump has repeatedly failed to convincingly denounce these hate groups. Instead, he has chosen to argue that  both sides  were responsible for the violence and accused counter-protesters of violently attacking the poor innocent Nazis, which has lead to widespread outrage.The NAACP is absolutely right. Bannon was just one of many racists in Trump s White House and his departure surely doesn t fix the overall problem, which is that Trump himself holds these same bigoted beliefs.Featured image via Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2017"
STUNNING DEVELOPMENT: OBAMA GIVES $75 MILLION US Tax Dollars To Mexico To Build Border Wall,"You have got to be kidding me! After all the times that Trump has been attacked by the Democratic side of our society for saying that we need a wall on our Mexican border to stop illegals from getting into our country and destroying our economy, Obama just pulled the most hypocritical and pointless move of his career.Obama just gave a  gift  of $75 MILLION to Mexico to provide material and equipment for the building of a border wall on Mexico s SOUTHERN border and to help cover the expense of training to help man the wall properly.So basically he is helping Mexico to keep out illegals from central America because Mexico doesn t want them. Yet the Mexican President, Enrique Pe a Nieto, says he will not pay for the border wall on the northern border of Mexico to keep them out of the U.S, and Obama somehow sees the logic in this?Trump has and always will be right about the wall blocking Mexico and if Obama had wanted to help a country keep illegals out then maybe he should start in the country that he is President in. Then again Obama has given trillions of dollars away to other countries while we Americans still sit here struggling to pay simple bill like mortgages, medical, food, electricity, etc.I guess he felt the need to stick it to us in a special kind of way before we unceremoniously drop him outside of the White House gates come January 2017.H/T [ Young Cons , Conservative Tribune ]",politics,"Sep 17, 2016"

"MAINE DEMOCRAT Congressman Makes DEATH THREAT Against President Trump…Calls Trump Supporters A**holes, Dumb F**ks","Maine State Representative Scott Hamann (D) is clearly an unhinged individual who is clearly not stable or responsible enough to be making legislation decisions on behalf of the people in the South Portland district. Hamann s Facebook post reveals just how fearful Democrats are of real change in government. President Trump has managed to get under the skin of and expose the truth nature behind the most intolerant group of people America. Not since the civil rights era have we seen such hatred towards anyone who is unlike them. Unfortunately for the Democrats, the hate that these government officials and Hollywood celebrities are spewing every day isn t going to help them to regain power. Contrary to what they believe, Americans are leaving the Democrat Party in droves, as they are waking up to the fact that these individuals are not only okay with using violence and vulgarity to shut down anyone who disagrees with them, but they are also the least tolerant and divisive group of people in America.Daily Caller -A Democratic state lawmaker in Maine appears to have made a death threat against President Trump. Trump is a half term president, at most, especially if I ever get within 10 feet of that pussy,  Rep. Scott Hamann wrote in a lengthy Facebook tirade on Tuesday.Hamann, who represents a district in South Portland and also works as project manager for a food bank, appears to have been responding to another Facebook user who expressed support for Trump.Hamann accused Trump of being  anti-American,  and an  admitted rapist  who was  installed by the Russians. Here is Rep. Scott Hamann s repulsive Facebook post:The 3-term Democrat is being asked to resign by Maine Republicans, who were furious over his Facebook post.  House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, to take action against him.Press Herald   Hamann has since removed the post from his Facebook page, but the Maine Republican Party was able to make a copy before he did so. In the closing sentence Hamann writes,  Trump is a half term president, at most, especially if I ever get within 10 feet of that pussy. Hamann, who is serving his third term in the Legislature, also lashes out at Trump s supporters and makes reference to the president s controversial statements about women and Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war survivor who was held in Vietnam. He s an admitted rapist,  Hamann wrote of the president.  Would you be okay with leaving him alone in a room with your wife? Demi Kouzounas, the chairwoman of the Maine Republican Party, issued a statement calling Hamann  unhinged and dangerous. Words cannot even begin to describe the level of revulsion I feel after reading Rep. Scott Hamann s recent tirade that has come to light,  Kouzounas said in a prepared statement.

 John McCain Completely Embarrasses His Own Party With STUNNING Admission About Russia And Healthcare Bill,"It s hard not to feel that John McCain, after 30 years in the Senate, is tired of it all. On Tuesday, he made an admission that s sure to piss off Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump and the rest of the GOP Congress, and I m sure he doesn t care.McCain was asked whether he was one of the few to see the super-duper secret Republican Senate healthcare bill. His answer was  no,  but that wasn t even the stunning part (and in a normal world, it would be a stunning admission). It was what he said next, even if it was an off-the-cuff joke, that really highlights the state of today s Republican politics.(No, he hasn t seen the bill and)  Nor have I met any American that has,  he added, according to Bloomberg.  I m sure the Russians have been able to hack in and gotten most of it. Source: The HillMcCain is not happy. He, and the rest of the Senate, are expected to vote next week on a bill they ve never seen. Note that these are some of the same people who say Obamacare was rammed through Congress with no debate, when in fact, the bill was debated and amended for over a year before becoming law. While the legislation was lengthy, every member of Congress and every American would have been able to read it before its passage. This isn t the case with the bill put forth by the Senate, which is presumably so bad that they re afraid to let even fellow Republicans see it.McCain s also not happy with the fact that Russia is freely hacking into our government. Even if Trump isn t somehow complicit, he certainly doesn t seem to give a rat s ass about it nor does he want to solve this national security threat. Instead, he pretends to bury his head in the sand. Even if that s not collusion, that s a violation of his oath of office.At least McCain, unlike most of his GOP brethren, knows that even when you refuse to see (or show) evil, evil exists. Now it s time for him to get on board with impeaching Trump.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 20, 2017"
 NUTJOB Missouri State Rep Beheads Live Chicken On Facebook Video To Make Point About Abortion,"A Missouri state representative is making national headlines today after he shared a video on Facebook of him decapitating a living chicken to drive home his disgusting opinion about abortion.In the grotesque video, GOP state Rep. Mike Moon promotes his anti-abortion bill while he hangs a live chicken upside down from a tree branch.Mr. Moon then says, When the governor called for the second special session this year, I was right in the middle of my summer job. But like any good career politician, when I get the call, I m going back to work,  he happily exclaims as he starts to slice into the neck of the chicken, causing it to writhe around and flap its wings.He then proceeds to mutilate the chicken, pulling out its heart while lecturing about the need to protect human lives. God gave us man dominion over life. He allows us to raise animals properly and care for them and then process them for food so we can sustain life. And that s what I m doing here with this chicken. So we ve been called back to this special session for the primary purpose of supporting life, protecting the unborn specifically. I think we need to get to the heart of the matter here. So today, I m filing a bill that will lead to the stopping of abortion in the state of Missouri and I hope you ll support it. The Springfield News reports that Moon s bill emphasizes that Missouri protect the right to life of all humans, born and unborn   and to require due process of law before the life of any human, born or unborn, is ended prior to natural death. The National Abortion Rights Leauge didn t think the stunt was very funny and calls Moon out for playing  political games  with the healthcare of women. It was insulting watching Rep. Moon use the rights of women across Missouri as some kind of political prop,  the organization said.  His call to ban abortion is disturbing and dangerous, no matter what he does with that chicken. Hopefully, the backlash from this stunt will make Mr. Moon realize that women deserve access to healthcare, regardless of what he likes to do to chicken in the privacy of his own home.Feature image via Screen Capture",News,"June 14, 2017"
 FINALLY: Two Members Of Bundy Militia Arrested,"For the last two weeks, armed domestic terrorists have been wreaking havoc on an Oregon town in a treasonous occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. They have been able to come and go freely, and no move by law enforcement, local or federal, was made to round up and arrest these criminals. That is, until Friday.Two of the militiamen made the mistake of using federal vehicles to go grocery shopping. That s what got them arrested, but not the occupation itself.first arrest made of #bundymilitia   two fed vehicles from compound were driven to Safeway. vehicles now impounded pic.twitter.com/RM94eKj2Uh  John Sepulvado (@JohnLGC) January 15, 2016This is the problem with the whole situation: What these people are doing is absolutely illegal, and they should most definitely be jailed for it. Instead, the authorities have let them play pretend Army for the last two weeks unimpeded. Instead of arresting them right away, instead they waited until they stole cars and charged them with that crime. And even then, it s only two members, when there are more than a hundred others there as well.This insurrection has cost the taxpayers an insane amount of money as well, as federal workers have been put on paid leave until the situation is resolved. The situation isn t any closer to any sort of peaceful resolution than it has been since its inception though; in fact, if anything, it is getting worse. Ammon Bundy and his hillbilly partners in crime are actually planning to completely ignore the government (like they aren t already), and instead set up their own laws on the occupied land. They also reportedly have plans to arrest the Harney County Sheriff. It has even been suggested that they should take on the FBI station that is keeping tabs on them.All of these fools need to be in jail. NOW. This has gone on long enough.

 Report: GOP Voters Are Too Stupid to Know Jeb And George W. Bush Are Related,"It s no secret that our frenemies on the Right are stupid. After all, conservatism, racism (one of the core GOP  values ), and low IQ go together like rama lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong, according to science. But, you know, with a lot less dancing and a bit more drooling.In Iowa, voters had some important questions about the GOP candidates   including  why is Donald Trump so orange,  a question science nor philosophy is likely to answer for decades yet to come.   There is widespread opinion that he either uses tanning beds or a full-body spray to get his bright tangerine finish,  a user on question and answer platform Quora postulated, though Trump is more likely to be found banging his daughter than in a tanning bed.Some wondered if Ted Cruz is from Canada, a query likely stemming from Trump and his fellow Cruz birthers  inane suggestions that Cruz is not eligible to be President.But the dumbest questions were related to Jeb Bush, according to Google. The Washington Post reports:Iowans wondered: Is Jeb Bush related to George W. Bush?   Who are Jeb Bush s parents?   Who is Jeb Bush s father? and Is Jeb Bush George Bush s brother? While no data is available concerning demographics of the folks who asked Almighty Google those ridiculous questions, they likely stem from Republicans  inability to know anything important about candidates they support past their willingness to build multi-billion-dollar walls to keep brown people out of the country, close mosques, and fight tooth-and-nail against women s rights.In any case, that people don t know Jeb and George Bush  are related is nothing short of baffling. Liberals certainly know, as we remember his role in stealing the 2000 election for his brother. This, of course, is something no one would have learned on Fox News. To someone whose primary concern was ensuring that a future war criminal would become President, Jeb Bush was just some guy at the time.Of course, the fact that any Americans don t know even the basics about  Jebra  is probably an indicator that he should join pedophile-worshipping Mike Huckabee and  baby parts  affiche natto Carly Fiorina in dropping out of the presidential race.Featured image via Political Garbage Chute/YouTube",News,"February 15, 2016"

Thousands of Trump supporters waited outside in line to see the Republican primary front-runner speak at the Peabody Opera House located in the downtown area of St. Louis.According to the St. Louis Dispatch, protestors were also in attendance at the campaign rally. They report: Supporters wore red Trump hats, waved American flags, and bought T-shirts and buttons from concession stands up set up around the perimeter. Protesters held up signs to crying hatred and, in a few cases, comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler. We re just trying to join with the Muslim community saying hate speech has no place here,  said Jay Kanzler, an Episcopal priest and attorney who was among the protestors.  We stand with our Muslim American bothers and sisters, our Jewish brothers and sisters, our Christian brothers and sisters for this community. We re not going to let Donald Trump s hate speech divide us. This lead to a near all-out race riot between Trump supporters and protestors.

The other is Trump s victory speech that he gave after winning the South Carolina primary last week. Here s the image:How Obama gives a victory speech vs how Trump gives a victory speech. pic.twitter.com/eCPkzHei6t  Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) February 24, 2016There is a vast gap between President Obama s and Trump s speaking skills, to say the least. Trump speaks like a third grader. Trump rarely utters a word that isn t in the 850 words included in the Basic English language. A politician s ability to inspire voters is an important part of being a great leader. Then again, Trump isn t actually a politician. He s a billionaire has-been reality TV star.Then again, Trump is speaking to his supporters, who have been shown to have a similar grasp of the English language.No president is perfect and that includes President Obama. However, he has consistently proven that when he talks he sounds like he is the only adult in the room. Part of that reason is his ability to speak with passion. It also helps that he has reason backing his message. When he has something to say, people listen. That s part of the reason he was elected president twice. As the then Senator Obama said on the night of his first primary election  They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose. You can watch President Obama s victory speech after his win in Iowa. It s a throwback to a time when Obama made national history for the first time.Featured image from Gage Skidmore via Flickr and By Chuck Kennedy (Official White House photo) (The Official White House Photostream on Flickr) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 24, 2016"
 Major U.S. Government Official: Why I’d RESIGN If Trump Wins,"Donald Trump has not yet officially received the Republican Party s presidential nomination   and there is a small effort still alive to derail him, though it is highly unlikely to be successful   but already a major official in the U.S. government has spoken out on why one of Trump s positions would cause him to leave his post.CIA director John Brennan was speaking at an event at the Brookings Institution and was extremely blunt about his standing on waterboarding torture: If a president were to order the agency to carry out waterboarding or something else I can say as long as I m director of CIA irrespective of what the president says I m not going to be the director of CIA that gives that order,  he said at a Wednesday event at the Brookings Institution.  They will have to find another director. Trump has often argued that he is in favor of waterboarding and torture, whose practice was encouraged by the George W. Bush administration after 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq. Earlier in the year at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire, Trump said,  bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. President Obama barred the military from using waterboarding after he took office in January of 2009. Experts have said that waterboarding and other forms of torture not only violate the Geneva Conventions of War, they are also simply not a good tool to fight terrorism.Studies have shown that people subjected to torture give up information in order to stop the abuse, and more often than not the information given is faulty, since stopping the abuse and not accuracy is at the top of their minds.Most Republicans have called for the use of torture to fight terrorism, but some oppose it, most notably Senator John McCain (R-AZ) who was subjected to torture when he was a hostage for the Vietcong army during the Vietnam War.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 13, 2016"

And that is expressly forbidden by federal regulations.On Wednesday, Donald Trump lashed out at the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter s product line after months of boycotts and lack of sales made it unfeasible to continue carrying them.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017On Fox & Friends, Conway literally begged Fox viewers to buy Ivanka s products. Go buy Ivanka s stuff is what I would tell you,  she said after accusing Nordstrom of attacking Donald Trump by targeting his daughter.  I hate shopping, I m going to go get some myself today. This is just a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. And with those words, Conway broke Federal Code  2635.702, which bans public employees from using their office for private or personal gain, including for family members. Donald Trump did this through Conway and she works for him, making her a public employee.Federal Code  2635.702 specifically states,An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member.It further states that,  An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise. There are only two exceptions to this rule and neither excuse what Conway did.And that why former ethics czar Norm Eisen called out Conway during an appearance on MSNBC and called for an investigation and penalties. By doing this ad   I have never seen anything like it   it s a violation of the rules, pure and simple. I imagine that you are going to see complaints flowing in. The responsibility to oversee this in the first instance is with the White House counsel, Don McGahn. He s going to need to look at the rules, look at the precedents and decide what range of penalties might apply. And I think the Office of Government Ethics will also have a look at it. So, it s a serious matter. Here s the video via YouTube:Kellyanne Conway and Donald Trump violated federal regulations and ethics rules. He literally used his office to advertise his daughter s shitty products by sending Kellyanne Conway on Fox News and there needs to be consequences for what they did.Read more:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"February 9, 2017"
LORETTA LYNCH Gives Radical Black Lives Matter Protesters PEP TALK: “I want you to know that your voice is important”,"Eric Holder in a dress Eric Holder got the ball rolling for Obama when he used taxpayer dollars to pay people to protest during the Trayvon Martin controversy. Loretta Lynch is just the person to carry his racist torch of injustice for the  oppressed  black man. These people are not capable of colorblind justice. Their desire to punish anyone who disagrees with their radical ideology is much stronger than their desire to see true and honest justice served in America Members of the Black Lives Matter movement should not get  discouraged by those who would use your lawful actions as a cover for their heinous violence,  Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Friday.Her encouragement of the radical movement came a few hours after five officers were gunned down and six were wounded by an African-American radical attacker during a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.Throughout her Friday statement, she zig-zagged between her calls for more political protests, her suggestions that cops should be blamed for the high number of African-Americans killed during interactions with law enforcement, and her calls for less violence during political protests. After the events this week, Americans across the country are feeling a sense of helplessness, of uncertainty, of fear. Now, these feelings are understandable and they are justified. But the answer must not be violence. The answer must never be violence,  Lynch said. Rather, the answer must be action: calm, peaceful, collaborative and determined action. Calm, peaceful, collaborative and determined action. We must continue working to build trust between communities and law enforcement. We must continue working to guarantee every person in this country equal justice under the law,  she said.She played up the administration s pre-election focus on gun control, instead of the political conflicts that spur violence.  And we must take a hard look at the ease at which wrongdoers can get their hands on deadly weapons, and the frequency with which they use them,  she said.Like many officials, Lynch also implied moral equivalence between the deliberately murdered officers in Dallas and the suspects killed by other police officers on duty.  This has been a week of profound grief and heartbreaking loss. The peaceful protest that was planned in Dallas last night was organized in response to the tragic deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota. We have opened a civil rights investigation in Louisiana and we are providing assistance to local authorities in Minnesota who are leading the investigation there,  said Lynch.Lynch repeatedly appeared to praise Black Lives Matter, though not by name, and encouraged black racial activists to continue demonstrating against police.  To those who seek to improve our country, through peaceful protest and protected speech, I want you to know that your voice is important. Do not be discouraged by those who would use your lawful actions as a cover for their heinous violence,  she continued. We will continue to safeguard your constitutional rights and to work with you in the difficult mission of building a better nation and a brighter future. And to all Americans, I ask you, I implore you: Do not let this week precipitate a new normal in this country. I ask you to turn to each other, not against each other as we move forward. But some of those demonstrators not easily restrained. Some black activists in Dallas called for murdering whites and police officers just last summer, telling one veteran:  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f ing piece of sh-t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. The Attorney General also included some vague calls for unity amid her controversial support for the divisive BLM movement.Via: Breitbart News ",politics,"Jul 8, 2016"
MOTHER OF 7 YR OLD CHARGED WITH “Endangerment” For Allowing Child To Play In Park Across Street From Home Unsupervised For An Hour,"Because the government knows best when it comes to raising your children or something like that.A Maine mother faces child endangerment charges for allowing her daughter to play at the park across the street from her house without her constant supervision.Nicole Jensen told WMTW she often allows her three children to play at the park a few hundred feet from her house and parents in the neighborhood make a coordinated effort to watch each other s children. She watches from her front porch.But when Jensen s 7-year-old daughter was playing in the park by herself last week, someone at the park called 911 to report she was unattended and police intervened.But instead of simply walking the child home, police tried unsuccessfully to call Jensen, then hauled the girl to the police station when the mother didn t immediately answer her phone, according to the Personal Liberty blog.Jensen said she requires her children to check in every hour when they re playing outside, but police chastised the mother for not keeping closer tabs and insinuated the girl was in danger at the park. They said,  Do you know where your daughter is?  and I said,  Yes,  and they said,  Well no you don t. She s at the police station,  Jensen recalled.  (The officer) said she was at the park unsupervised, no one know where she was, and if I hadn t gotten a hold of you, I would have taken her into (the Department of Health and Human Services). Westbrook Police Chief Janie Roberts told the news site she estimated the girl was at the park for about an hour before she was detained. That s a long time for a 7-year-old to be by herself in any location, let alone a public park,  Roberts said.Police eventually charged Jensen with child endangerment. They brought her to the police station when her house is right there,  Jensen said, according to Personal Liberty. She did nothing wrong,  she said.  She s followed all of my rules.

"HEY, BERNIE SANDERS: 18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS Have NOT Happened This Year!","The left has locked onto a stat that 18 school shootings have happened this year. This is FAKE NEWS that needs to be shut down. Bernie Sanders and others referred to this statistic right after the Parkland mass shooting.Anti-gun groups included in the statistics a suicide at a school in Michigan that had been closed. This fake statistic trivializes the horrific crime that happened at Parkland or any other TRUE school shooting. EVERYTOWN FOR GUN SAFETY  TRIES TO HIJACK THE NARRATIVE:Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg backed anti-gun group founded after the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was the original source for that particular statistic. The group s initial tweet claiming that the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was the 18th school shooting in 2018 has now been retweeted more than 1,200 times:Our hearts are with all those impacted by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida today.This is the 18th school shooting in the U.S. in 2018. https://t.co/YdPLz4zuOS  Everytown (@Everytown) February 14, 2018The group defines a school shooting is  any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds. ACCIDENTAL GUN DISCHARGES AND SUICIDES AREN T  SCHOOL SHOOTINGS It turns out that  Everytown s database turns up ridiculous examples that ARE NOT school shootings:On January 10,  gunshots, which most likely originated off-campus, hit a window of the visual arts building at California State University, San Bernardino. Classes were immediately canceled as the university went into lockdown, though a police search failed to turn up any shooter on campus.  On February 5, in a suburb of Minneapolis,  a school liaison officer was sitting on a bench talking with some students when a third-grader pressed the trigger on the officer s holstered weapon, causing it to fire and strike the floor.  Those were no doubt terrifying incidents for the people involved, and they may even have policy implications, but they are not what anyone thinks of when they hear the phrase  school shootings. But the media and several prominent politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), eagerly regurgitated the context-free statistic in the aftermath of the shooting in Florida, apparently without stopping to wonder why they hadn t heard about the other 17 school shootings that supposedly had happened since January 1.This isn t just an embarrassing case of confirmation bias. Spreading such misleading statistics affects how Americans from ordinary working people to elected officials understand and cope with these terrible incidents.",politics,16-Feb-18
DID REP SHEILA JACKSON LEE Bump First Class Passenger From Seat?…Angry Passenger Tweets Out Photo!,"This is so funny but so infuriating! Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee apparently makes it a habit of bumping first class passengers on flights. She might think twice before doing it again after the angry woman she bumped took photos of Lee enjoying the seat the passenger paid for. Ouch!Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) in seat 1A the one I paid for dearly, and the one United gave to her without my consent or knowledge! Fellow congressman on same flight said she does it repeatedly. @united pic.twitter.com/Q2c6u6B0Yp  Jean-Marie Simon (@JeanMarieSimon1) December 23, 2017Chron reports:Jean-Marie Simon was a passenger on a flight from Houston to Washington D.C. and has accused United Airlines of giving her first-class seat to U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. D-Houston. The flight attendant threatened to remove her from the plane for complaining and snapping a photo of the Houston congresswoman:A mechanical problem with the plane delayed take-off and after about 50 minutes, she said, passengers were invited to consult with a gate agent about alternative flights.Simon said she went to the front and snapped a photo of Jackson Lee and told a flight attendant that she knew why she d been bumped.In her statement, Jackson Lee said she overheard Simon speaking with an African-American flight attendant and saw her snap the photo.JACKSON LEE PULLS THE RACE CARD: Since this was not any fault of mine, the way the individual continued to act appeared to be, upon reflection, because I was an African American woman, seemingly an easy target along with the African American flight attendant who was very, very nice,  Jackson Lee said in the statement.  This saddens me, especially at this time of year given all of the things we have to work on to help people. But in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart, if it is perceived that I had anything to do with this, I am kind enough to simply say sorry. Simon said Jackson Lee s statement accused her of racism, adding:  I had no idea who was in my seat when I complained at the gate that my seat had been given to someone else,  she said.  There is no way you can see who is in a seat from inside the terminal. PASSENGER THREATENED?About five minutes after Simon took the photo on the plane, Simon said, another flight attendant sat next her and asked if she  was going to be a problem. Simon said she replied that she just wanted to go home.IS THE $500 VOUCHER EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING BY THE AIRLINE? WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SIMON ARRIVED AT THE GATE: It was just so completely humiliating,  said Jean-Marie Simon, a 63-year-old attorney and private school teacher who used 140,000 miles on Dec. 3 to purchase the first-class tickets to take her from Washington D.C. to Guatemala and back home.When it came time to board the last leg of her flight home from George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Dec. 18, after a roughly hour-long weather delay, Simon said the gate attendant scanned her paper ticket and told her it was not in the system.Did you cancel your flight?, the attendant asked. No,  she said she replied.  I just want to go home. Her seat, 1A, was taken, she was told. Simon was given a $500 voucher and reseated in row 11, Economy Plus.Simon later learned that Jackson Lee was in her pre-purchased seat and has alleged that the congresswoman received preferential treatment, which United denies.THIS ENTITLED MENTALITY WILL HOPEFULLY GET JACKSON LEE KICKED OUT OF CONGRESS!",politics,"Dec 25, 2017"
10 U.S. Navy Sailors Held by Iranian Military – Signs of a Neocon Political Stunt,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE predicted in its new year s look ahead, we have a new  hostage  crisis underway.Today, Iranian military forces report that two small riverine U.S. Navy boats were seized in Iranian waters, and are currently being held on Iran s Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. A total of 10 U.S. Navy personnel, nine men and one woman, have been detained by Iranian authorities. NAVY STRAYED: U.S. Navy patrol boat in the Persian Gulf (Image Source: USNI)According to the Pentagon, the initial narrative is as follows: The sailors were on a training mission around noon ET when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into Iranian-claimed waters and were detained by the Iranian Coast Guard, officials added. The story has since been slightly revised by White House spokesman Josh Earnest to follow this narrative:The 2 boats were traveling en route from Kuwait to Bahrain, when they were stopped and detained by the Iranians.According to USNI, search and rescue teams from the Harry S. Truman Strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the Iranians. We have been in contact with Iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly,  Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told AP. According to Persian Gulf TV: Farsi Island is one of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf, Bushehr province of Iran. There is an IRGC Navy base on this Island. The island has an area of about 0.25 km  and is completely restricted to public, due to top secret governmental activities. According to NBC News, U.S. State Department is in touch with Tehran officials and the Iranians recognize that the U.S. Navy straying off course was a mistake, and that the sailors will be released  within hours.  WAR INC: CNN s Wolf Blitzer wasted no time in ramping-up talk of military tension with Israeli-financed neocon Senator Tom Cotton.Neocon StuntAlready, the U.S. media, including CNN and FOX, are running with the talking point that,  this could not have come at a worse time for President Obama right before tonight s State Of Union speech, when he s trying to prove to the American people that Iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal. This latest Naval  controversy  also comes days before the implementation phase of the Iran Nuclear Deal. To say this is a coincidence might be naive.That said, could GOP and Israel-aligned members of the Pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre  mini-crisis  in order to help weaken U.S.-Iran relations, and by extension, Obama s controversial Iranian Nuclear Deal?This looks likely to be the case, as evidenced by the quick appearance of the Israel Lobby-sponsored, pro-war U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R), placed by CNN to direct aggressive U.S. military talking points live on air as the story broke today. Cotton (photo, left) immediately called the event  hostile  and blamed Iran for the U.S. boat drifting into Iranian waters, and then blamed the  crisis  on President Obama, who he claims,  has emboldened the Iranian aggression. Cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie, on which his media handler, CNN s Wolf Blitzer, does not even blink, much less challenge Cotton s imaginary statement: The Iranians, who are largely responsible for killing our (American) soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cotton then went on to threaten Iran, saying that: These sailors and both vessels  need to be immediately released. If they are not released, then the Iran (nuclear) deal should not go forward, and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression.  Cotton then proceeded to give a veiled (nuclear?) threat to Iran, saying that,  All (military) options should be on the table.  Would Washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this   by dispatching the boats off course, knowing full-well that Iran would not harm U.S. personnel, but using the incident to injure a lame duck? The answer is  yes , and they ve done it before In 1979, 52 American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days in what became known as the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which just happened to take place during a US presidential election cycle, with then president Jimmy Carter (D) running for reelection against challenger Ronald Reagan (R). The crisis, including a horrific failed rescue attempt, was used against Carter in the media. According to reports at the time Reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new Iranian regime to  hold-off  releasing the hostages until after the election. In the end, Reagan won and took credit for that  victory .Not surprisingly, at the end of his prearranged CNN segment, Cotton invoked the  feckless foreign policy  of Jimmy Carter which  caused  the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, and compared that to President Obama s current policy.Of all the U.S. Officials CNN could have brought in on  short notice , they chose Senator Tom Cotton, the most hawkish and closest aligned to Israel. Clearly, this looks like a neocon stunt.Stay tuned for more updates.READ MORE IRAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iran Files",Middle-east,"January 12, 2016"

OOPS! VIDEO Shows Senator McCain Saying He’ll Fight To REPEAL and REPLACE Obamacare Only 9 Months Ago: “We have to scrap it entirely and start over”,"In spite of Senator John McCain s promise to his constituents only 9 months ago when he was running for reelection, that he would fight to repeal and replace Obamacare, McCain voted late last night with two other liberal Republican senators, and every Democrat senator to keep Obamacare intact.But that s not what Senator McCain promised Arizona voters he would do only 9 months ago On October 10, 2016, John McCain faced off against his Democrat opponent Congresswoman Kirkpatrick in a televised debate. At the center of the debate was the disastrous Obamacare and what could be done to fix it. McCain responded: For the first time in history, a major entitlement reform was rammed through the Congress of the United States without a single vote from the other side. I fought for weeks, and weeks, and weeks against Obamacare and they would not allow us an amendment. There was not a single amendment allowed. No input from the minority party. We were the minority party. Now Congresswoman Kirkpatrick wants us to sit down and work together. Here s how we work together, we repeal and we replace it. McCain went on to argue that the majority of the American people have  resoundingly rejected Obamacare. One of the debate moderators asked McCain if it was possible for Congress to try to improve Obamacare rather than to try to repeal it. McCain rejected the idea that it could be fixed and that the only solution is to repeal Obamacare:  We have to scrap it entirely and start over.  McCain went on to explain why Congress MUST repeal Obamacare,  It s a scam and the problem is, that the cost is becoming prohibitive and we ve got to change it and fix it.

 Lindsey Graham: Trump Should Be Treated With The Same Respect Republicans Gave Obama,"We re wondering if Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) is OK. He just doesn t seem to be himself lately. The South Carolina Republican was so fiercely critical of alleged president Donald Trump, but that s all suddenly changed now. Graham, who once called Trump a  jackass,  praised the amateur president on Saturday as a leader who is open-minded  and is even willing to reach out for help, even late at night, according to the Washington Examiner. What have I learned about our president? He s curious, he asks questions, and he knows no fear,  Graham said in his remarks at the South Carolina Republican convention.  And he s under siege unlike any president I ve ever seen in my entire life   They don t believe he won; I do. Now Obama was somewhat hard for us, but I thought we were somewhat respectful,  Graham added without one bit of irony whatsoever.Graham then went to on to disrespect former President Barack Obama by calling him a  community organizer who apologized for America every turn all over the world. Let me tell you that you have a commander in chief that s not going to let this country get walked over anymore,  he said.And that s really cute, don t you think? He said that of Obama who had 20 years of experience under his belt before taking the job as President while praising a former reality show star who had zero experience in politics. He calls and I m honored that he would call me and I want to help him,  he said.  He calls me when I m asleep and he calls me after I go to bed. I wish he would rest more. I gave him my phone number. So far so good. It s nice he has a cozy relationship with a man who just recently penned him a letter to assure him that he has no connections to Russia. Lindsey Graham requested that information. Trump s lawyers said in the letter that a review of the last 10 years of Trump s tax returns revealed that he has no income from Russia  with a few exceptions. Here s the kicker: The law firm who sent the letter actually has deep ties to   wait for it   Russia. Lindsey Graham appeared to be that one Republican with a spine willing to call out the White House, but now he s rolling over while claiming that Republicans respected Obama. Democrats are just being big ol  meanies to the man who is plagued in scandals while only 120ish days into the job.Trump, for the record, is the same man who dogged Obama for years, insisting that our first black President was actually a scary Muslim from Kenya. Obama did not have conflicts of interest. The biggest scandal at this same amount of time during Obama s presidency was that he put Dijon mustard on his hamburger. That was the big scandal featured on Fox News for a week. In contrast, Trump has a massive amount of conflicts of interest.Sure, Lindsey, we ll give Trump the same respect Republicans gave Obama.

BREAKING ENERGY DEPARTMENT AUDIT REVEALS SHOCKING PRICE TAG AND LIABILITY FOR OBAMA’S GREEN ENERGY FAILURES,"The American taxpayers are on the hook for less than predicted but this is still huge! It was Obama s green energy scam with companies like Solyndra that was like flushing millions and billions down the toilet Taxpayers are on the hook for more than $2.2 billion in expected costs from the federal government s energy loan guarantee programs, according to a new audit Monday that suggests the controversial projects may not pay for themselves, as officials had promised.Nearly $1 billion in loans have already defaulted under the Energy Department program, which included the infamous Solyndra stimulus project and dozens of other green technology programs the Obama administration has approved, totaling nearly about $30 billion in taxpayer backing, the Government Accountability Office reported in its audit.The hefty $2.2 billion price tag is actually an improvement over initial estimates, which found the government was poised to face $4 billion in losses from the loan guarantees. But as the projects have come to fruition, they ve performed better, leaving taxpayers with a shrinking   though still sizable   liability. As of November 2014, DOE estimates the credit subsidy cost of the loans and loan guarantees in its portfolio   that is, the total expected net cost over the life of the loans   to be $2.21 billion, including $807 million for loans that have defaulted,  the GAO said in its report to Congress.The green program loan guarantees were created in a 2005 law and boosted by the 2009 stimulus. The first applications were approved in 2009, and through 2014 the Obama administration had issued some 38 loans and guarantees, covering 34 projects ranging from nuclear power plants to fuel-efficient vehicles to solar panels and wind-generation technology.Read more: Washington Times",left-news,"Apr 28, 2015"

HOW PRESIDENT EISENHOWER Solved The Illegal Immigration Problem In America,"Since this article was written in 2006, the illegal immigration crisis in America has exploded. Barack Obama, his fellow Democrats, leftist organizations (and even some Republicans beholden to corporations who desire cheap labor in America), have desperately tried to shame Americans into accepting amnesty as the only option to solve this crisis. One doesn t have to look too far to see how miserably they have failed. Americans are not interested in giving up our jobs, our national security or the future of our country so the Democrat party can have a monopoly on voters, or to make it easier for business and corporations to hire cheap labor.  It is no accident that Donald Trump experienced a meteoric rise in the polls after he boldly proclaimed he would make building a wall on our southern border a priority. The media tried to shame him, only causing him to double down, claiming he would not only build the biggest and best wall on our southern border, but he claimed that Mexico would pay for it. This article is for all of the naysayers who believe the illegal immigration crisis can t be solved. The problem can be solved. We just needed a President with a backbone, who loves his country, is willing to take bold moves to secure our nation and most of all, a President who truly believes Americans come first.Over fifty years ago, when newly elected Dwight Eisenhower moved into the White House, America s southern frontier was as porous as a spaghetti sieve. As many as 3 million illegal migrants had walked and waded northward over a period of several years for jobs in California, Arizona, Texas, and points beyond.President Eisenhower cut off this illegal traffic. He did it quickly and decisively with only 1,075 United States Border Patrol agents   less than one-tenth of today s force. The operation is still highly praised among veterans of the Border Patrol.Although there is little to no record of this operation in Ike s official papers, one piece of historic evidence indicates how he felt. In 1951, Ike wrote a letter to Sen. William Fulbright (D) of Arkansas. The senator had just proposed that a special commission be created by Congress to examine unethical conduct by government officials who accepted gifts and favors in exchange for special treatment of private individuals.General Eisenhower, who was gearing up for his run for the presidency, said  Amen  to Senator Fulbright s proposal. He then quoted a report in The New York Times, highlighting one paragraph that said:  The rise in illegal border-crossing by Mexican  wetbacks  to a current rate of more than 1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal Government. Years later, the late Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower s first attorney general, said in an interview with this writer that the president had a sense of urgency about illegal immigration when he took office.America  was faced with a breakdown in law enforcement on a very large scale,  Mr. Brownell said.  When I say large scale, I mean hundreds of thousands were coming in from Mexico [every year] without restraint. Although an on-and-off guest-worker program for Mexicans was operating at the time, farmers and ranchers in the Southwest had become dependent on an additional low-cost, docile, illegal labor force of up to 3 million, mostly Mexican, laborers.According to the Handbook of Texas Online, published by the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas State Historical Association, this illegal workforce had a severe impact on the wages of ordinary working Americans.The Handbook Online reports that a study by the President s Commission on Migratory Labor in Texas in 1950 found that cotton growers in the Rio Grande Valley, where most illegal aliens in Texas worked, paid wages that were  approximately half  the farm wages paid elsewhere in the state.Profits from illegal labor led to the kind of corruption that apparently worried Eisenhower. Joseph White, a retired 21-year veteran of the Border Patrol, says that in the early 1950s, some senior US officials overseeing immigration enforcement  had friends among the ranchers,  and agents  did not dare  arrest their illegal workers.Walt Edwards, who joined the Border Patrol in 1951, tells a similar story. He says:  When we caught illegal aliens on farms and ranches, the farmer or rancher would often call and complain [to officials in El Paso]. And depending on how politically connected they were, there would be political intervention. That is how we got into this mess we are in now. Bill Chambers, who worked for a combined 33 years for the Border Patrol and the then-called US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), says politically powerful people are still fueling the flow of illegals.During the 1950s, however, this  Good Old Boy  system changed under Eisenhower   if only for about 10 years.In 1954, Ike appointed retired Gen. Joseph  Jumpin  Joe  Swing, a former West Point classmate and veteran of the 101st Airborne, as the new INS commissioner.Influential politicians, including Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (D) of Texas and Sen. Pat McCarran (D) of Nevada, favored open borders, and were dead set against strong border enforcement, Brownell said. But General Swing s close connections to the president shielded him   and the Border Patrol   from meddling by powerful political and corporate interests.One of Swing s first decisive acts was to transfer certain entrenched immigration officials out of the border area to other regions of the country where their political connections with people such as Senator Johnson would have no effect.Then on June 17, 1954, what was called  Operation Wetback  began. Because political resistance was lower in California and Arizona, the roundup of aliens began there. Some 750 agents swept northward through agricultural areas with a goal of 1,000 apprehensions a day. By the end of July, over 50,000 aliens were caught in the two states. Another 488,000, fearing arrest, had fled the country.By mid-July, the crackdown extended northward into Utah, Nevada, and Idaho, and eastward to Texas.By September, 80,000 had been taken into custody in Texas, and an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 illegals had left the Lone Star State voluntarily.Unlike today, Mexicans caught in the roundup were not simply released at the border, where they could easily reenter the US. To discourage their return, Swing arranged for buses and trains to take many aliens deep within Mexico before being set free.Tens of thousands more were put aboard two hired ships, the Emancipation and the Mercurio. The ships ferried the aliens from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico, more than 500 miles south.The sea voyage was  a rough trip, and they did not like it,  says Don Coppock, who worked his way up from Border Patrolman in 1941 to eventually head the Border Patrol from 1960 to 1973.Mr. Coppock says he  cannot understand why [President] Bush let [today s] problem get away from him as it has. I guess it was his compassionate conservatism, and trying to please [Mexican President] Vincente Fox. There are now said to be 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in the US. Of the Mexicans who live here, an estimated 85 percent are here illegally.Border Patrol vets offer tips on curbing illegal immigration One day in 1954, Border Patrol agent Walt Edwards picked up a newspaper in Big Spring, Texas, and saw some startling news. The government was launching an all-out drive to oust illegal aliens from the United States.The orders came straight from the top, where the new president, Dwight Eisenhower, had put a former West Point classmate, Gen. Joseph Swing, in charge of immigration enforcement.General Swing s fast-moving campaign soon secured America s borders   an accomplishment no other president has since equaled. Illegal migration had dropped 95 percent by the late 1950s.Several retired Border Patrol agents who took part in the 1950s effort, including Mr. Edwards, say much of what Swing did could be repeated today. Some say we cannot send 12 million illegals now in the United States back where they came from. Of course we can!  Edwards says.Donald Coppock, who headed the Patrol from 1960 to 1973, says that if Swing and Ike were still running immigration enforcement,  they d be on top of this in a minute. William Chambers, another  50s veteran, agrees.  They could do a pretty good job  sealing the border.Edwards says:  When we start enforcing the law, these various businesses are, on their own, going to replace their [illegal] workforce with a legal workforce. While Congress debates building a fence on the border, these veterans say other actions should have higher priority.1. End the current practice of taking captured Mexican aliens to the border and releasing them. Instead, deport them deep into Mexico, where return to the US would be more costly.2. Crack down hard on employers who hire illegals. Without jobs, the aliens won t come.3. End  catch and release  for non-Mexican aliens. It is common for illegal migrants not from Mexico to be set free after their arrest if they promise to appear later before a judge. Few show up.The Patrol veterans say enforcement could also be aided by a legalized guest- worker program that permits Mexicans to register in their country for temporary jobs in the US. Eisenhower s team ran such a program. It permitted up to 400,000 Mexicans a year to enter the US for various agriculture jobs that lasted for 12 to 52 weeks.

" Conservative Leader Hears Tenant Speaking Arabic, What Happens Next Made Us Sick With Rage (IMAGES)","The case of a New York Conservative Party leader and her Muslim tenant has gone viral after people the world over were left stunned by perhaps one of the most horrifying cases of modern-day racism reported in the U.S.Last September, 33-year-old Morrocon-born woman Hasna Jalal moved into the $1,500 a month apartment in the Pompey Avenue building of MaryLou Shanahan, former chair of an NY branch of the Conservative Party. It was to be the beginning of months of racial abuse that would end with Shanahan facing felony charges of grand larceny, being in possession of $425,000 worth of stolen property of Jalal s, and a lawsuit for evicting Jalal because she was Muslim. It is however, the details of the harassment that take our breath away.Images via NY Post/SiliveThe suit alleges that the situation began on Sept 6 2015, when Shanahan overheard Jalal in the hall speaking Arabic to her Moroccan relatives. Shanahan reportedly screamed: I don t need anybody speaking Arabic in my house! The neighbors will think you re from Al Qaeda. From this day on, Shanahan launched a campaign of terror against Jalal. It seemed every time Jalal left her apartment, Shanahan would be there. As they passed, Shanahan would hurl insults such as  nasty Arab , and  slut! Next, Jalal would come home to find offensive notes pinned to her door. One read,  Get the f*ck out of my house. You re a f king nasty Arabic pig. This continued to escalate for nearly one month, before matters reached a horrifying climax.On Oct 4, Jalal returned home to find herself locked out of the apartment. The locks had been changed. She began calling on neighbors to try to establish what happened, and they told her they had seen Shanahan clearing the contents of the apartment with removal men earlier in the day. The landlord had emptied Jala s apartment and locked her out while she had been at work.All-in-all, Shanahan had confiscated $425,000 worth of Jalal s property.Jalal went to the police and Shanahan was arrested later the same day for grand larceny and possession of stolen property. But the conservative wasn t done yet. She took to Facebook to begin harassing Jalal all over again, posting: The police will not touch a sociopath, foreigner,  Moroccan, muslim. Jalal has since filed a lawsuit against Shanahan for evicting her on racial grounds, and the former Conservative Party chair will appear in court on the federal charges on Tuesday.This case comes amid a backdrop of hate crimes against Muslims in New York, which have risen sharply in the last year. Attacks against Muslim Americans and mosques in the state have tripled since the Paris Attacks and San Bernardino shootings. According to The New York Times:The spike includes assaults on hijab-wearing students; arsons and vandalism at mosques; and shootings and death threats at Islamic-owned businessesThese attacks have no doubt been incited by conservatives like Shanahan, who prey on the fear and prejudice of others for their own political ends. The same is playing out on the national stage, with the entire GOP clown car adopting a fundamentally racist, bigoted stance toward non-whites, and non-Christians. The result is the daily oppression and trauma suffered by the likes of Hasna Jalal and others, who simply want to get on and live the American dream.Featured Image via Flickr",News,"January 25, 2016"
 Neil deGrasse Tyson And J.K. Rowling BURN Trump With Searing Joke On Twitter (TWEETS),"There is no getting away from Donald Trump, and he can t get away from his impossibly offensive attitude toward women. He s a sexual predator that has no problem asking men on  The Apprentice  to rate women based on their physical attributes, and talked freely about their breast size and whether he d consider sleeping with them. That doesn t even touch his being proud of sexually assaulting women.Aside from that, this election cycle has brought out a certain type of antagonism and uncertainty about both candidates, particularly over their leadership styles and abilities. Neil deGrasse Tyson sort of spoke to that when he asked the following question:If a Space Alien landed in the USA & requested:  Take me to your leader , I wonder how Pres Trump would react vs Pres Clinton  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 14, 2016He probably didn t expect J.K. Rowling, the famous author of the Harry Potter series, to respond at all, let alone with the following burn:Afraid we need to know whether the alien has breasts before we can answer. https://t.co/xHE9K5F7xt  J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) October 14, 2016We don t care who you are, that s funny right there. Why? Because it s not only one of the biggest torches one can take to the catastrophe that is The Donald, but also because it keeps the fact that he s a danger to women and girls in the spotlight in a very mocking way.And, as we all know here, mocking King Cheeto is the only real way to deal with him on the internet.As another sign of how dangerous he is for women, he s busy calling all the women who ve accused him of sexual assault of being liars and seeking fame. He also asked one of his crowds why women aren t coming forward about President Obama, since obviously, if they ll lie for the sole purpose of smearing him, they should also be willing to lie to smear people he hates. In fact, they probably ought to be more willing, since he s absolutely amazing and everyone he hates is the scum of the Earth.Some others answered Tyson s question in a salty way, too:@neiltyson Grope them?

Trump strokes his ego with abuses  KimberlySAustralia (@kimsmit08234204) October 14, 2016@neiltyson @realDonaldTrump will ask  do they have genetalia I can grab.  Chuck Nice (@chucknicecomic) October 14, 2016And then there are these, which poke fun at Trump s, ahem, policy positions, among other things:@neiltyson Would Trump fund the building of a Dyson Sphere to keep  em out, or try to make aliens pay for it?  Freddy-Kruger Effect (@Jayextee) October 14, 2016@neiltyson he d have the best space aliens. His space aliens are going to be so great, my god, you won t even believe it.  Jessica Hellis (@baddestmamajama) October 14, 2016@neiltyson Trump would immediately have a wall built around the alien and not pay the mason.  Tom (@TommieWho) October 14, 2016Tyson may have started a tiny shitstorm with this, but it s funny. In the end, though, the answer to the Trump part of his question is this: Trump would very quietly let the aliens take us over through our computer systems, and conspire with them to take down all his enemies, including the Clintons.Then, when the questions and investigations reached their fever peak and everyone was clamoring to know what was going on, and he went on television to explain and reassure the public that he wasn t responsible for the chaos, he d look straight into the eyes of all of America, whip off his invisible glasses and say,  Aliens.

 Chinese State Media Calls Trump Out After He Gives One China Policy The Middle Finger,"Donald Trump has been poking China with a proverbial stick and his provocations haven t gone unnoticed. Now, Chinese state media is calling Trump and his disastrous excuse for foreign policy out.Trump did his best to kick off a diplomatic crisis with China when he accepted a congratulatory call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. China views Taiwan as a rogue province and the U.S. agreed not to recognize their government as part of the  One China  policy. Naturally, Trump has no f*cks to give.Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, published a scathing editorial on Monday slamming Trump for his remarks regarding the One China policy. They speculated  that Trump may use the policy to force China to make a compromise on trade. The One China policy is not for selling. Trump thinks that everything can be valued and, as long as his leverage is strong enough, he can sell or buy. If a price can be put on the US Constitution, will the American people sell their country s constitution and implement the political systems of Saudi Arabia or Singapore?Trump needs to learn to handle foreign affairs modestly, especially the China-U.S. relationship. More importantly, a hard struggle against Trump is needed to let him know that China and other world powers cannot be easily taken advantage of. The piece then lays out the following threat, most likely in reference to North Korea:  If Trump gave up the One China policy, publicly supported Taiwan independence and wantonly sold weapons to Taiwan, China would have no grounds to partner with Washington on international affairs and contain forces hostile to the U.S. In response to Trump s provocations, Beijing could offer support, even military assistance to U.S. foes. The One China policy has maintained peace and prosperity in Taiwan,  notes the article, before adding that the  U.S. has no control over the Straits, and Trump is na ve to think he can use the One China policy as a bargaining chip to win economic benefits from China. The editorial then offers Trump an out, because they do realize that he is a babbling idiot, saying,  It s very likely that Trump may not have put too much thought into it. He is no geopolitical maniac, but just has little experience in diplomacy. He doesn t understand how dangerous it can be when he involves the U.S. in such an explosive game. After all, this requires some personal experience. But the piece then ends with a warning to the world: China needs to be fully armed and prepared to take a Sino-U.S. rollercoaster relationship together with Trump. And many others in the world will probably also need to fasten their seatbelts. China has filed an official complaint with the U.S. government regarding Trump s chat fest with the Taiwanese leader. They also sent a message on Monday by flying a bomber capable of firing long-range nuclear weaponry over contested territories located in the South China Sea. Trump is playing a dangerous game.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2016"
Pay Off: The Establishment Rewards Comey with $2 million Book Deal,"21st Century Wire says For his role in helping to sow chaos in the US political system and for promulgating the official conspiracy theory that Russia somehow  hacked  the US electoral process helping Donald Trump to win last November, and also ensuring that no charges were brought anywhere near the Clintons   former FBI Director James Comey has just received the first of many gifts from the Establishment.James Comey is no stranger to elite circles, and is clearly regarded by those at the top as  a safe pair of hands. As 21WIRE reported last year, James Comey served on the board of banking giant HSBC   the same bank that was convicted of international drugs and terrorism money laundering, as well as a bank which was closely linked to the corrupt Clinton Foundation. After working fellow lawyers Eric Holder and Lorretta Lynch to stage manage the public fall out from revelations about HSBC s epic criminal enterprise, and their subsequent slap on the wrist, Comey was then rewarded by President Obama when he was appointed head of the FBI in 2013.By anyone s measure, Comey was central to the mess which has resulted from the political circus surrounding the establishment s efforts to derail the Trump campaign, and  now through the Trump presidency.Congratulations. You got your book deal. You ve made it James AP/The GuardianThe former FBI director James Comey has signed a $2m ( 1.5m) deal for a book about leadership and decision-making that will draw on his career in government, which included the high-profile drama leading up to his sacking from Donald Trump s administration.According to the publisher, Comey will tell how he handled the bureau s probe into Hillary Clinton s private email server and the allegations of ties between Russia and Trump s presidential campaign.Trump sacked Comey as FBI chief in May, later telling NBC News that he was angered by the FBI s investigation into  this Russia thing , which he insists is a fake story. Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president.The book was acquired by Flatiron, an Macmillan imprint, which promises that Comey will cite  examples from some of the highest-stakes situations in the past two decades of US government . It will also  share yet unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career .The book is currently untitled and scheduled for publication next spring. Throughout his career, James Comey has had to face one difficult decision after another, as he has served the leaders of our country,  Flatiron said in a statement.  His book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure. By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself.

CIA Claims of Russian Intervention in US Election Fall Flat,"21st Century Wire says How seriously can we take a  secret CIA assessment  that Russian intervention in the U.S. Presidential election played a role in the victory of President Elect Donald J. Trump when it comes from an organization that has intervened extensively in so many countries  sovereign governments?The Anti-Media The Daily SheepleAccording to a  secret CIA assessment,  Russia intervened in the U.S. election to undermine confidence in the electoral system and boost support for Donald Trump.The president-elect has already rejected this notion, though the implications of claims regarding Russian involvement are still unclear.Once again, this kind of pro-Clinton/anti-Russian-based narrative has already been completely debunked. For example, in his recent article,  Anonymous Leaks to the WashPost About the CIA s Russia Beliefs Are No Substitute for Evidence,  Glenn Greenwald brilliantly explains why this story does not merit our attention. He astutely notes: There is still no such evidence for any of these claims. What we have instead are assertions, disseminated by anonymous people, completely unaccompanied by any evidence, let alone proof. As a result, none of the purported evidence   still   can be publicly seen, reviewed, or discussed. Anonymous claims leaked to newspapers about what the CIA believes do not constitute proof, and certainly do not constitute reliable evidence that substitutes for actual evidence that can be reviewed.

ETHIOPIAN MUSLIM Monster Deported From U.S. 10 Years After Performing “Clitorectomy” On Daughter With Scissors,"With a growing number of Muslim refugees and immigrants living in America who are strict adherents of Sharia Law, it should come as no surprise that female genital mutilation is not so uncommon anymore in many parts of the United States. It is a felony to perform a clitorectomy on a female in America, but getting caught is the hard part A petition from the womens  group Equality Now reveals that immigration has put the United States on a list that will be much more difficult for progressive immigration enthusiasts to cheer. A massive influx of immigrants from Muslim-populated countries in Africa and the Middle East has led the group to conclude that more than half a million girls in the U.S. are in danger of having their exposed sexual organs skinned from their bodies.The practice is known as female genital mutilation (FGM).The Atlantic describes how the procedure is carried out:It usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. In its most extreme form infibulation almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. A small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. The cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. It is rare for any anesthesia to be used.As the United States continues to mail out immigrant visas to countries with hostile and violent attitudes towards women, it will increasingly challenge Americans  self-perception of what it means to live in a First World country.Haha Dukureh, an FGM-survivor and founder of the activist organization Safe Hands for Girls, warned that  every year thousands of girls here in the United States go through female genital mutilation.   Breitbart NewsA Gwinnett County Muslim man was deported today after female  serving 10 years in an American prison (on the American taxpayer dime) for a genital mutilation sentence. An Ethiopian man convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children was removed from the United States on Monday.Khalid Adem, 41, was arrested for using scissors to mutilate the genitals of his 2-year-old daughter.He was deported on Monday after serving 10 years in prison.Adem was an Ethiopian citizen and native when he was living in Gwinnett County, Georgia in 2006. (He was convicted in 2006, but his wife who turned him in believes the crime was committed in 2001). His case was drew national attention for being the first criminal conviction in the United States for female genital mutilation (FGM).He became the catalyst for the specific criminalization of FGM under Georgia state law.Female genital mutilation is a federal crime, and any involvement in committing this crime is a human rights violation that results in imprisonment and potential deportation. (This crime includes doing the procedure within the United States as well as sending women overseas to be cut) .  Jihad Watch",politics,"Mar 16, 2017"
 Angry Voters Run Joni Ernst Out Of Town After She Tells Them To Save More Money After GOP Kills Obamacare (VIDEO),"Joni Ernst may portray herself as tough in her campaign ads, but in real life she s about as yellow as the bedsheets of a certain Russian hotel after a Trump visit. Ernst had planned a small  veterans roundtable  in Maquoketa City Hall in her home state of Iowa, but she found herself met by a packed room with more crammed into the hallways of the building.Ernst slinked in a side door to avoid protesters and called almost exclusively on veterans, but one of them asked her a question that made her turn tail and run: All we hear is repeal and replace, but we don t hear about a real clear plan, other than talking about health savings accounts, which really amounts to your own money, quite frankly. And he s right. A Health savings account doesn t quite make sense if you don t have the money to pay into it, or if you suffer chronic conditions, or if you encounter even a moderately expensive health need. Nevertheless, Ernst went through her preplanned talking points as the audience jeered, booed, and mocked her   especially when she got to the part about HSAs being awesome.#Ernst is put on the spot on Obamacare by an enrollee.

" Without Trump, Ted Cruz Gets Dumped On During GOP Debate And Fails To Impress Iowans","Ted Cruz probably wishes Donald Trump had attended the debate last night.Because without Trump, all of the focus on Thursday night turned to Ted Cruz, who is in second place behind the billionaire real estate mogul.As seven Republicans took the stage for the official debate in Iowa last night, Trump held his own competing event. One would think that would especially benefit Ted Cruz, but he failed to deliver and the Des Moines Register declared that he had a  rough night. In other words, without Trump, Cruz took over the spotlight and everyone was able to witness him fall on his face as the other candidates and the moderators turned their attention on him because The Donald was not there to be a distraction. If that is what Trump planned for all along, his strategy to skip the debate was a masterstroke.Ted Cruz ended up being plastered on the front page of the Register on Friday morning with a headline that will be hard to swallow for the Cruz campaign, but the main story didn t go any better for the Texas Senator either. Without the dominant national front-runner in the room, the target was the candidate who inherited center stage for the night: Ted Cruz,  the front page read.  But the Texas U.S. senator largely forfeited this golden opportunity. Indeed, even Iowa Republican activists believe Cruz was the loser in this debate. Candidates and voters are not putting up with him tonight,  said Emily Grimm, a 22-year-old Republican activist from Des Moines.  I don t think there was a clear winner at this debate. But I think the clear loser was Cruz. Cruz always knows how to use standard Republican sound bites to garner applause. The moment he senses that he might be losing the crowd with policy, he just throws in a few grand words to gain applause,  said Grimm, a fiscal conservative who worked for Mark Jacobs  2014 U.S. Senate campaign.At one point in the debate, Cruz channeled Trump by complaining about the moderators like a toddler and threatened to leave the stage. If you guys ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage,  Cruz said.And that didn t go over very well at all.University of Iowa political science professor Tim Hagle said the attack  fell really flat. He seemed plastic and insincere,  said another Iowa Republican, according to Politico. His entanglement with the moderators was one of the worst moments for a candidate in any of the debates,  a New Hampshire Republican told Politico.And yet another Iowa Republican explained why Trump made a good move by sitting out while Cruz got hammered. Trump got exactly what he wanted. Nobody lays a glove on him, while the rest of the field beat each other up. Better yet, Trump got both former caucus winners to attend his event, and his main competitor, Ted Cruz, might have had his worst debate performance of the campaign. Ted Cruz clearly has his presidential aspirations tied to Iowa. Should he lose, he would be faced with overcoming Trump s 19-point lead in New Hampshire and his 16-point lead in South Carolina.Make no mistake, losing the last debate before Iowa votes is a disaster for Cruz and as previously stated, he probably wishes Trump had been present at the debate. Because if he had been, Cruz would not be the butt of embarrassing headlines today.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"January 29, 2016"

" After Horrific National Anthem Sung At Trump Rally, Pianist Hilariously Pretends To Accompany","While it s not nice to criticize people, per se, for attempting to sing one of the hardest songs ever to sing, one person s rendition of the Star Spangled Banner at a Donald Trump rally in Eugene, Oregon, was flawlessly criticized without words.Zach Lapidus posted a video to Facebook of a split screen of himself on piano pretending to accompany the person singing the National Anthem.To be honest, once the key modulations were hit they were on point, but there were modulations on nearly every line of the song. In fact, almost every key seemed to have been hit at one point or another during the song, and Lapidus seemed to nail every single one of those key changes.The Star Spangled Banner is a tough song to play by any musician, and even harder for vocalists, because the range from the lowest notes to the highest notes are nearly two octaves. Credit should always be given to those who attempt to sing the National Anthem, and even more credit given to those who can do it well. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times.This article isn t so much to make fun of the singer   although, she is at a Trump rally and that should be ridiculed, but rather this is to compliment Lapidus on his accompaniment and ability to pick up on all the modulations. Well done.Maybe this is the version of the National Anthem taught at the Trump School of Music. https://www.facebook.com/zach.lapidus/videos/10107105609892679/Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 14, 2016"

BREAKING: SCREW THE FRONT-RUNNERS Chosen By “We The People”…The GOP Establishment Has Other Plans,"Here s the REAL reason Mitt Romney came out against Trump. If you can t beat a candidate ON THE SAME TEAM fair and square, resort to plan B right? Ironically, if the GOP establishment fought back against Obama as hard as they re fighting against Trump, he wouldn t likely be the front-runner right now.Former Speaker of the House John Boehner has endorsed current Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for president, in the event that no Republican candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.Politico reports that Boehner, speaking at a conference in Boca Raton, Florida, said:  If we don t have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I m for none of the above. They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So I m for none of the above. I m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.

The pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements, and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in Obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.In the aftermath of that 2012 loss, Ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing, convinced that Republicans shared responsibility with Democrats and the president. As a result, he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Mar 16, 2016"
" MSNBC Host Makes Emotional Plea To Trump Voters: Wake Up, ‘It’s A Scam’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his campaign have been scrambling to do damage control after his multiple attacks on the Khans, Gold Star parents whose Muslim son died fighting for his country. One of Trump s latest pathetic attempts to recover was to meet with Gold Star families so he could brag about it later.But MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski wasn t impressed, and was able to see right through Trump s act. In a segment about Trump s latest attempt to fool America, she had a direct message for Trump supporters: wake the f*** up. Brzezinski insisted that Trump s entire campaign was a  scam  and his meeting with these families was no different   Trump was just trying to fool gullible Americans into believing that he cares about things other than himself.Visibly upset that a person running for president would do something so heartless and take advantage of trusting Americans this way, the MSNBC host said: I m just trying to   because, look, Trump supporters, people who support Donald Trump, are people who should be respected for how they feel. Brzezinski became emotional several times while trying to beg Trump s supporters to be more critical. As her voice cracked with emotion, she continued: But I worry that they don t understand that they re being scammed, and they re being scammed by somebody who s really good at it, so it s not like, you know, it s their fault. But I will say that it s a scam, what Trump is selling. Remarking on just how heartless Trump s attacks had been on the Khans, Brzezinski urged voters not to be fooled. Talking to Gold Star families after the biggest gaffe in probably presidential politics, candidacy s history, what he did with the Khans   he s just trying to clean up. I mean, do you want someone who speaks from the heart and says nothing or says anything, or do you want someone who speaks from the heart and has some principle behind it and sticks to his word? This is a scam, and it seems like he has a lot of followers.

BREAKING: Did Hillary’s Unsecured CLASSIFIED EMAILS Cause Execution Of Iranian Accused Of Working With U.S.? [VIDEO],"Will the State Department ever tell the truth and prove that careless, reckless, lying Hillary was responsible for his death? A State Department spokeswoman dodged questions Monday about whether the discussion of Shahram Amiri, an Iranian scientist who was executed by the Iranian government for working with the U.S., in a pair of Hillary Clinton s private emails may have played a role in his recent fate. We re not going to comment on what may have led to this event,  said Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman. I couldn t speak to Iranian judicial procedures related to this specific case,  Trudeau said.  We ve made our concerns known writ large around Iranian due process. She noted the State Department had been  very public about this case when [Amiri] chose to return to Iran,  pointing to a press conference Clinton gave in July 2010.In those remarks, Clinton compared Amiri s ability to leave the U.S. on  his own free will  with Iran s decision  to hold three young Americans against their will.  She did not reference the scientist s work with the U.S. government.But emails made public in August show State Department aides referring to Amiri as  our friend.  An Iranian official was quoted attributing Amiri s execution to his collusion with the  Great Satan,  America.  Washington Examiner",Government News,"Aug 8, 2016"

FOX NEWS BOMBSHELL REPORT: Trump Transition Team Lawyer Accuses Robert Mueller Of Improperly Obtaining Documents Related To Russian Probe,"On Friday, Democrats were doing their best to push a rumor that President Trump is about to fire special counsel Robert Mueller before Christmas. According to The Hill   Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday that  rumors  on Capitol Hill suggest President Trump could fire special counsel Robert Mueller before Christmas, after Congress leaves Washington for the winter recess. The rumor on the Hill when I left yesterday was that the president was going to make a significant speech at the end of next week. And on Dec. 22, when we are out of D.C., he was going to fire Robert Mueller,  Speier told California s KQED News.The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), also said Friday that he is worried that Republicans leading the committee are seeking to shut down the committee s investigation by the end of the year. Republicans have scheduled no witnesses after next Friday and none in 2017 [sic]. We have dozens of outstanding witnesses on key aspects of our investigation that they refuse to contact and many document requests they continue to sit on,  he tweeted Friday.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rumors that Trump could fire Mueller have swirled since Mueller s appointment in May.While Democrats are spreading rumors about Mueller s firing, Fox News has dropped another Mueller bombshell.FOX News   A lawyer for the Trump presidential transition team is accusing Special Counsel Robert Mueller s office of inappropriately obtaining transition documents as part of its Russia probe, including confidential attorney-client communications, privileged communications and thousands of emails without their knowledge.In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent to House and Senate committees on Saturday, the transition team s attorney alleges  unlawful conduct  by the career staff at the General Services Administration in handing over transition documents to the special counsel s office.The transition legal team argues the GSA  did not own or control the records in question  and the release of documents could be a violation of the 4th Amendment   which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.Kory Langhofer, the counsel to Trump for America, wrote in Saturday s letter that the GSA handed over  tens of thousands of emails  to Mueller s probe without  any notice  to the transition.The attorney said they discovered the  unauthorized disclosures  by the GSA on December 12th and 13th and raised concerns with the special counsel s office. We understand that the special counsel s office has subsequently made extensive use of the materials it obtained from the GSA, including materials that are susceptible to privilege claims,  Langhofer writes.The transition attorney said the special counsel s office also received laptops, cell phones and at least one iPad from the GSA.Trump for America is the nonprofit organization that facilitated the transition between former President Barack Obama to President Trump.The GSA, an agency of the United States government, provided the transition team with office space and hosted its email servers. We continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon,  Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Saturday.The special counsel s office declined to comment Saturday.

WOW! 1996 NYT’s Stunning Article SLAYS First Lady Hillary Clinton…Calls Her A “CONGENITAL LIAR”…”she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying”,"How did we ever get to the point where we would even  consider electing a woman who is the most well-known liar in America? The media has been buzzing since what many consider an inappropriate private conversation that Donald J. Trump had with another man 11 years ago was released. Funny how the media is willing to gloss over a shameful career of a  congenital liar  simply because her last name is Clinton (wife of the former President Bill Clinton who was impeached for lying under oath to a Grand Jury) and because she comes equipped with the right genitatlia   Americans of all political persuasions are coming to the sad realization that our First Lady   a woman of undoubted talents who was a role model for many in her generation   is a congenital liar.Drip by drip, like Whitewater torture, the case is being made that she is compelled to mislead, and to ensnare her subordinates and friends in a web of deceit.1. Remember the story she told about studying The Wall Street Journal to explain her 10,000 percent profit in 1979 commodity trading? We now know that was a lie told to turn aside accusations that as the Governor s wife she profited corruptly, her account being run by a lawyer for state poultry interests through a disreputable broker.She lied for good reason: To admit otherwise would be to confess taking, and paying taxes on, what some think amounted to a $100,000 bribe.2. The abuse of Presidential power known as Travelgate elicited another series of lies. She induced a White House lawyer to assert flatly to investigators that Mrs. Clinton did not order the firing of White House travel aides, who were then harassed by the F.B.I. and Justice Department to justify patronage replacement by Mrs. Clinton s cronies.Now we know, from a memo long concealed from investigators, that there would be  hell to pay  if the furious First Lady s desires were scorned. The career of the lawyer who transmitted Hillary s lie to authorities is now in jeopardy. Again, she lied with good reason: to avoid being identified as a vindictive political power player who used the F.B.I. to ruin the lives of people standing in the way of juicy patronage.3. In the aftermath of the apparent suicide of her former partner and closest confidant, White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster, she ordered the overturn of an agreement to allow the Justice Department to examine the files in the dead man s office. Her closest friends and aides, under oath, have been blatantly disremembering this likely obstruction of justice, and may have to pay for supporting Hillary s lie with jail terms.Again, the lying was not irrational. Investigators believe that damning records from the Rose Law Firm, wrongfully kept in Vincent Foster s White House office, were spirited out in the dead of night and hidden from the law for two years   in Hillary s closet, in Web Hubbell s basement before his felony conviction, in the President s secretary s personal files   before some were forced out last week.Why the White House concealment? For good reason: The records show Hillary Clinton was lying when she denied actively representing a criminal enterprise known as the Madison S.& L., and indicate she may have conspired with Web Hubbell s father-in-law to make a sham land deal that cost taxpayers $3 million.Why the belated release of some of the incriminating evidence? Not because it mysteriously turned up in offices previously searched. Certainly not because Hillary Clinton and her new hang-tough White House counsel want to respond fully to lawful subpoenas.One reason for the Friday-night dribble of evidence from the White House is the discovery by the F.B.I. of copies of some of those records elsewhere. When Clinton witnesses are asked about specific items in  lost  records   which investigators have   the White House  finds  its copy and releases it. By concealing the Madison billing records two days beyond the statute of limitations, Hillary evaded a civil suit by bamboozled bank regulators.Another reason for recent revelations is the imminent turning of former aides and partners of Hillary against her; they were willing to cover her lying when it advanced their careers, but are inclined to listen to their own lawyers when faced with perjury indictments.Therefore, ask not  Why didn t she just come clean at the beginning?  She had good reasons to lie; she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying herself or in suborning lying in her aides and friends.No wonder the President is fearful of holding a prime-time press conference. Having been separately deposed by the independent counsel at least twice, the President and First Lady would be well advised to retain separate defense counsel.

"LONDON’S MAYOR HAS HARSH WORDS For Our Community Organizer In Chief: “Butt Out, Mr. Obama”","Our country is spinning out of control. Obama s orchestrated efforts with race baiters like Al Sharpton and leaders of Black Lives Matter terrorists have created a divide between races like my generation has never known. Obama skips Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia s funeral and the funeral  of iconic First Lady, Nancy Reagan, but finds time to take a few pot shots at GOP presidential front-runner, Donald Trump while attending a hipster festival with Michelle. Barack s proven over and over he doesn t have the time or desire to behave like a leader, and now, he s going to tell the Europeans what they need to do as it relates to the EU? When I heard from the Baron today that our current president is planning to go to Britain to make a case to the public for staying in the European Union, I was momentarily stunned. What happened to  leading from behind  and letting other countries handle their own affairs?By now we re all jaded by this president. He does nothing for free, nothing in which there is not some eventual pay-off to him. So sticking his nose into Britain s affairs should come as no surprise, given his track record of the last interminable years of his time in office.Or maybe he doesn t know how deeply disliked he is by anyone who didn t sign onto his pathetic  Peace Prize  back in the beginning of his reign? Maybe he believes what the sycophantic press tells him? Or  or  wait! Is he using a kind of reverse psychology on the British   i.e., knowing how much he is held in contempt, anything he suggests, they would oppose? Nah he s far too removed from reality to grasp that concept.So here we have London Mayor Boris Johnson s take on the subject. He s far more interesting to follow on this than any national government figures would be. Via: Gates Of ViennaThese excerpts are from The Telegraph. The only thing Mr J got wrong is the extent to which Obama has undermined America s sovereignty, particularly at our southern border and on the subject of changing our culture and monolingual character. One could say that Mr. Obama s decision to drop in and lecture the Brits on this particular subject is not contradictory at all; it is congruent with his own behavior and sentiments regarding America s sovereignty.Obviously, Mr. Johnson hasn t been paying attention to the American presidential campaign. But they why would he? Had he done so, though, he d have seen an unprecedented populist following for Donald Trump, based on that theme: sovereignty.We want ours back in one piece.I love America. I believe in the American dream. Indeed, I hold that the story of the past 100 years has been very largely about how America rose to global greatness   and how America has helped to preserve and expand democracy around the world. In two global conflicts, and throughout the Cold War, the United States has fought for the founding ideals of the republic: that government of the people, by the people, for the people should not perish from the earth.So it is on the face of it a bit peculiar that U.S. government officials should believe that Britain must remain within the EU   a system in which democracy is increasingly undermined.Some time in the next couple of months we are told that President Obama himself is going to arrive in this country, like some deus ex machina, to pronounce on the matter. Air Force One will touch down; a lectern with the presidential seal will be erected. The British people will be told to be good to themselves, to do the right thing. We will be informed by our most important ally that it is in our interests to stay in the EU, no matter how flawed we may feel that organisation to be. Never mind the loss of sovereignty; never mind the expense and the bureaucracy and the uncontrolled immigration.The American view is very clear. Whether in code or en clair, the President will tell us all that UK membership of the EU is right for Britain, right for Europe, and right for America. And why? Because that   or so we will be told   is the only way we can have  influence  in the counsels of the nations.It is an important argument, and deserves to be taken seriously. I also think it is wholly fallacious   and coming from Uncle Sam, it is a piece of outrageous and exorbitant hypocrisy.There is no country in the world that defends its own sovereignty with such hysterical vigilance as the United States of America. This is a nation born from its glorious refusal to accept overseas control. Almost two and a half centuries ago the American colonists rose up and violently asserted the principle that they   and they alone   should determine the government of America, and not George III or his ministers. To this day the Americans refuse to kneel to almost any kind of international jurisdiction. Alone of Western nations, the US declines to accept that its citizens can be subject to the rulings of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. They have not even signed up to the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Can you imagine the Americans submitting their democracy to the kind of regime that we have in the EU?So why is it essential for Britain to comply with a system that the Americans would themselves reject out of hand? Is it not a blatant case of  Do as I say, but not as I do ?For entire letter, go to: The Telegraph ",Government News,"Mar 14, 2016"
RACIST RANT From Supreme Court Justice Exposes Slanted Personal Opinion On Law Enforcement,"Supreme Court Justic Sotomayor went on a racist rant about how law enforcement has targeted minorities and put fear in  black and brown  people: It is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny. She s weighed in before in a racist manner:   I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn t lived that life    Supreme Court Justice SotomayorSotomayor once again brings her racist view to the court clouding her decisions on ALL Americans:Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Monday issued a vehement dissent in a Fourth Amendment case   writing that the majority s opinion sanctions police stops that  corrode all our civil liberties and threaten all our lives. The fiery objection came on case where a Utah man challenged his arrest based on a stop that was later found to be unlawful. The 5-3 majority opinion, Sotomayor wrote, will have dramatic ramifications for law-abiding citizens targeted by police, especially minorities.  It is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny,  she wrote.  For generations, black and brown parents have given their children  the talk    instructing them never to run down the street; always keep your hands where they can be seen; do not even think of talking back to a stranger   all out of fear of how an officer with a gun will react to them.  By legitimizing the conduct that produces this double consciousness, this case tells everyone, white and black, guilty and innocent, that an officer can verify your legal status at any time,  she added.  It says that your body is subject to invasion while courts excuse the violation of your rights. It implies that you are not a citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be cataloged. With four major decisions due in the next week, including cases on affirmative action, abortion and immigration, Sotomayor s anger signals that what has been a quiet term since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia could get increasingly contentious. Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences,  she said, for jurists who are women and nonwhite,  our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.

TRUMP WANTS MODERATOR FREE Debate With Hillary,"Donald Trump can be a stickler for things that seem to be weighted to benefit  the other guy  so to speak, and his stand on an upcoming debate between him an Hillary is no different.He recently told CNBC over a phone interview,  I think we should have a debate with no moderator, just Hillary and I sitting there talking. Trump came up with this idea a week after a candidate forum last week in New York City with Matt Lauer left many Clinton supporters angry with host network NBC. Lauer thoroughly grilled Hillary about her e-mail scandal and he was roasted by Democrats nationwide for it, even though it is an important point to the Presidency. If one can not run her emails correctly then how can one run this country?But in the true fashion of Trump it appears that he would like a fair and level playing field for BOTH parties at the first debate on Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, LI. The debate will be moderated by Lauer s NBC colleague Lester Holt, and Trump would rather simply sit with Hillary and debate amongst only each other.No loaded questions, no moderator attacks, no chance of anyone planting any type of false or inflammatory rhetoric to sway the people with falsehoods or one-sided political points. Instead Trump wants to simply let the people listen to two adults discussing the real issues and then choose for themselves who they would prefer based on that alone. Sounds like the perfect debate setting to me.Trump said,  The fact is, they are gaming the system, and I think maybe we should have no moderator. Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate. I think the system is being rigged, so it s going to be a very unfair debate.He is probably correct. Call us all a basket of deplorable conspiracy nuts but we have been proven right time and time again throughout this campaign and it will not be surprising for it to happen again.On another note , Trump recently made a surprise and low-key appearance at a nonprofit event in New York City. He stopped in very briefly at the BGC Partners Charity Day on Monday. He was invited by Danny Lavecchia, a member of Trump s golf course in New Jersey and a managing partner of the brokerage, which used to be part of Cantor Fitzgerald.  He purely came here to raise money for charity, as a friend of mine,  Lavecchia, a Clinton donor, said. Lavecchia said he fully intends to vote for Trump, and will now be asking for Clinton to return his $2,700 donation.H/T [ NY Post ] ",politics,"Sep 15, 2016"
"UNITED AIRLINES GROUNDED, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND NYSE SHUT DOWN…All Citing “Technical” Issues…There’s No Coincidence…Really?","So the NYSE, Wall Street Journal and United Airlines have all been experiencing  technical issues,  but there s no correlation?United Airlines grounded flights across the country for part of Wednesday after experiencing computer problems.An airline spokeswoman said that a router problem reduced  network connectivity  for several software applications.Around midday, spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm said,  We fixed the router issue, which is enabling us to restore normal functions. The Federal Aviation Administration lifted a ground-stop order after nearly two hours, allowing United planes to fly again.United did not immediately say how many flights were affected.United, the nation s second-biggest airline, has suffered similar technology problems before, also leading to mass delays and cancellations.The airline briefly halted all takeoffs in the U.S. on June 2 because of a problem in its flight-dispatching system. United said then that about 150 flights were affected.United also struggled through a series of computer outages in 2012 after switching to the passenger-information system of Continental Airlines after that carrier merged with United. Those outages caused hundreds of flights to be delayed. High-paying business travelers were outraged; United CEO Jeff Smisek apologized for failing to provide good customer service.After a 2010 merger, United elected to combine many computer systems and frequent-flier programs all at once. Executives believed that any disruptions would thus be short-lived. By contrast, Delta and Northwest integrated their systems in stages after a 2008 merger, and American Airlines is taking Delta s same go-slow approach now as it absorbs US Airways.Other airlines, however, have also been hit by computer problems. In April, more than 50 American flights were delayed when a software glitch prevented pilots from seeing some airport maps on their tablet computers.After Wednesday s problems, United apologized to customers and said they could change travel plans without being charged the usual $200 reservation-change fee. In some cases, the airline said it would also waive any difference in fare for the rescheduled trip. We don t know everything behind this morning s issues yet, but today s incident underscores the sense that something is very wrong at United,  said Gary Leff, co-founder of frequent-flier website MilePoint.Shares of Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc. fell $1.25, or 2.3 percent, to $53.06 in midday trading.WSJ: The Wall Street Journal s website homepage was not accessible Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the New York Stock Exchange had to shut down due to a computer glitch.

 Hannity Gets His A** Kicked By Newsweek For Lying Constantly And Insulting People With Epilepsy,"Sean Hannity is definitely going to blow a gasket about this.In recent weeks, major mainstream media outlets have been slamming the Fox News host for pushing lie after lie after lie in his effort to get Donald Trump elected in November.First, Jon Stewart came out of retirement for one night to slam Hannity so hard for being a hypocrite when it comes to the way he has treated Trump versus the shitty way he has treated President Obama that the conservative host could hardly stammer his way through an angry response to the comedian the next day.And then Hannity threw a hissy fit after Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called him  Fox News  dumbest anchor  for attacking Republican leaders for not blindly supporting Trump no matter what he does.Then CNN host Brian Stelter took Hannity to the woodshed for helping Trump claim that the election is rigged for Hillary Clinton.And if that weren t enough, the Washington Post also dealt Hannity a major rebuke for lying about Trump rescuing stranded Marines after the Gulf War came to a close.Now Hannity just got his ass handed to him by Newsweek over his constant stream of lies and the fact that he insulted people with epilepsy by questioning Hillary Clinton s health.Kurt Eichenwald absolutely destroyed Hannity in a published column and it s clear that he just smacked Hannity in the face with a gauntlet. HARD.A man who purports to be a dutiful Catholic, Hannity has made a career out of violating the ninth commandment (or eighth in his faith) against lying about others. If Hannity stopped vomiting up falsehoods, his program would be nothing but a test pattern. From him and the others in the  Who cares if it s false?  conservative media camp, we have heard over the decades that Hillary and Bill Clinton murdered many people, that the Bush administration found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that Obama could be on the verge of declaring martial law, and on and on.They are pretend journalists pumping out propaganda to scared, foolish people.Eichenwald then took Hannity to task for telling his audience that Hillary may have had a seizure in a video which shows Clinton  Being pulled in different directions by multiple speakers at once, Clinton playfully acted like a bobblehead doll, smiling and then speaking after the joke was over. But Hannity characterized Clinton s playfulness as a serious medical condition, which Eichenwald did NOT appreciate.I know this response to Sean Hannity is a little raw, but as someone with epilepsy, I hope my editors will let this slip through: Fuck you, Sean. Your willingness to deceive your viewers to degrade those of us with epilepsy, to suggest something is a seizure when it looks nothing like one, to leave people dumber about this condition is unforgivable.It is rare for a mainstream journalist to use such strong language, but Hannity certainly deserved it. And that was only the beginning.Eichenwald went on to talk about what a real seizure is, explaining: People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald then delivered the final blow.While I know you almost never apologize for anything you do on the air, this sin requires some penance. It can be done in secret if you don t have the character to make a public pronouncement of regret. Write a check. Make a donation to help those you demeaned and damaged if you are unable to show the backbone to undo the damage you have done, you can understand why I say you  purport  to be a Catholic. If you really were one, you d be worried about burning in hell for what you ve done.Thus far, Sean Hannity has not responded nor has he thrown a temper tantrum over Eichenwald basically putting him over his knee and giving his an ass-whipping. But you can bet one will probably happen soon as Hannity has a thin skin just like Donald Trump.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"August 15, 2016"

One person was dead, the FBI said.Officials said it all began with a traffic stop while Bundy and some of his followers were en route to a community meeting in John Day, about 70 miles away.Shots were fired after FBI agents, Oregon State troopers and other law enforcement agencies made the stop.Details of the arrest remain unknown, but charges are pending related to the group s 25-day takeover of the wildlife refuge.Bundy and about three dozen of other individuals occupied the wildlife refuge earlier this month after two local ranchers were sent to prison.

 BOMBSHELL: Devin Nunes’ Entire Net Worth Sunk In Company With Strong Ties To Russia,"If today s fiasco, which came courtesy of House Intel chair Devin Nunes, wasn t enough to convince anyone that he can t conduct a credible investigation into whether or not Trump and his teams colluded with Russia, then this should be: Nunes has put almost his entire net worth into a winery with strong ties to Russia.How strong? Well, the Alpha Omega Winery has distributors all over the U.S., but just a few abroad. One of those overseas distributors is the Luding Trading Company in Russia. Luding is, in fact, Russia s largest distributor for alcoholic beverages. But they don t just operate in Russia   they also appear to have a relationship with Vladimir Putin: The Luding Company and the Yerevan Ararat Brandy-Wine-Vodka factory sent greetings to Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, on his 55th birthday and made a birthday present of bottles of the Noy, the Sovereign 55 cognac and the Vanatur and Varpet unique 1952 vintage wines, 1952 being the President s birth year. If Russia were truly a free, democratic state, then maybe this could be overlooked as nothing more than a large company wishing the leader of a country that had given them so much a happy birthday. But Russia, under Putin, is anything but truly free. With Luding being the country s largest distributor of alcohol, it s highly unlikely that Putin doesn t have his fingers in it somewhere. The fact that Nunes has his money sunk there is a pretty big deal.It s also odd that Alpha Omega Winery would have a relationship with Russia s largest distributor when they only have a relationship with one Western nation (Switzerland). They don t have any relationships with any other distributor in the EU, which means no relationships with NATO allies at all.Then there s the fact that Nunes is one of the people Trump called upon to refute news about the whole Russia scandal. That right there compromised the House s investigation into Trump and Russia because it blurs the lines between the intelligence community, the White House, and Congress.And Nunes actually did what Trump asked him to   he started sending messages to reporters challenging the Russia stories. As the chairman of the committee investigating the Trump-Russia tie, he should never have done that.It appears more and more likely that Nunes was never acting independently in this investigation. And given that he s got business ties to Russia tenuous or not he should have recused himself from this investigation the instant it got underway.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"March 22, 2017"
WATCH: Gun Nut Believes Trump’s ‘Second Amendment’ Threat Is A Call To Arms,"Donald Trump s  Second Amendment  threat just took a more frightening turn.National outrage ensued after the Republican nominee suggested on Tuesday that gun owners do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating judges to the Supreme Court. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,  Trump said.  Although the Second Amendment people   maybe there is, I don t know. This statement prompted the Secret Service to take the unprecedented step of responding to an assassination threat by a presidential candidate against an opposing candidate, whom the Secret Service is charged with protecting and would be in the line of fire should a right-wing gun nut answer Trump s dog whistle.And it appears that at least one gun nut is interpreting Trump s dog whistle call as a call for armed insurrection if Hillary Clinton becomes president and doesn t pick who they want her to pick as a Supreme Court Justice.Greg from Michigan called into C-SPAN on Wednesday morning and while he denied that Trump was calling for Hillary to be shot and killed he frighteningly declared that Trump was actually calling for a bloody armed revolt if conservatives don t get their way. Number one, Mr. Trump was not threatening assassination of Hillary. But what he was implying and could happen is if Hillary got her way and did do away with Second Amendment rights, there are a lot of us who are gun owners who are going to object to that very strongly. And since we do have firearms, it might if it comes down to it be us having to defend our rights with those guns, just as the revolutionaries did in the Revolutionary War. Here s the video via C-SPAN:Trump s rhetoric just took a scary turn and his supporters are taking him seriously. Republicans have talked about  Second Amendment remedies  before but American voters have been consistent in rejecting candidates who spew such rhetoric. The idea of using guns to force your political agenda on the country is a threat to our democracy and has no place in this country. It s time for voters to once again reject this rhetoric by defeating Trump by a landslide. Republicans need to learn once and for all that threats of gun violence is not a political strategy and is a sure way to lose elections.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"August 10, 2016"
 ‘Tehran’ Tom Cotton Throws Tantrum After White House Exposes Him As Clueless Obstructionist,"The Republican senator who gained infamy last year by attempting to sabotage a historic nuclear deal with Iran is back at it again   this time by trying to derail a crucial appropriations bill so America is forced to violate the agreement.Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton got the moniker  Tehran Tom  after he and many of his Republican colleagues in the senate sent a brazenly out of line letter directly to the Iranian capitol in an effort to convince the country to stop negotiating with President Obama. The plan not only backfired (the Iranians delighted in mocking the Republicans), but it led to a major backlash from across the country. Politics may be getting nasty, but it seems betraying your country to score a cheap shot against the president still crosses a major line.Unable to understand when he has lost, Cotton has since been working behind the scenes to undermine the agreement any way he can. This week, he and his loyal band of obstructionists introduced an amendment intentionally meant to rankle relations between the two countries. Cotton had tried to bar the purchase of  heavy water produced in Iran.  Heavy water is  a component of making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy.  Part of the deal with Iran involved the country handing over its stock of heavy water (to show they were serious about ending their nuclear program)   but Cotton doesn t want America to take it. Why? Because then the deal would actually work.Needless to say, the White House was furious. At a press conference, Press Secretary Josh Earnest let Cotton have it: So it is clear what the intent of his amendment is. Senator Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water. I m confident that he couldn t differentiate heavy water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Cotton is fast becoming a single-issue politician. The time and energy he pours into trying to hurt Iran-United States relation borders on pathological. Even many of his colleagues, some of whom signed his letter in 2015, have given up thinking they can stop this agreement. Not Tehran Tom. He keeps plugging away.On Twitter, Cotton did not take the news of his White House dress down well. He suggested that he, a sitting United States Senator, isn t aware the existence of  sparkling water  because he was in the military   a claim many found  dubious.As for you @PressSec , you re right, I don t know much about sparkling water. It isn t served in Army, unlike in your ritzy West Wing.

WALMART WILL MELT CLASS RINGS WITH CONFEDERATE FLAG: [Video] Refuses To Fulfill Order For Arkansas Woman…Will Refund Payment,"An Arkansas woman who went to pick up the class ring she ordered from Walmart left disappointed, after store officials told her the retailer s new policy barred them from turning the item over   because it bore an image of the Confederate flag.Elaine Glidewell told KFSM someone from the store in Fort Smith called her to pick up the ring she d ordered for her nephew, but when she arrived on Tuesday, a clerk told her she couldn t have it. The ring had been ordered before Walmart stopped selling items bearing images of the flag, in the wake of controversy that stemmed from a racially-charged shooting in South Carolina. I wanted to cry,  Glidewell told KFSM, adding that the store clerk said the ring would be  melted. Glidewell said she paid $320 for the ring and was going to present it to her nephew, who recently graduated. He had expressed interest in a design that bore a Rebel mascot that incorporates the Confederate battle flag. She got her money back, but no ring. They wouldn t let me have the ring. It had a note on it, was in a plastic bag, it said do not sell. It was signed by the store manager,  Glidewell said.Brian Nick, spokesman for Walmart, told FoxNews.com Glidewell was denied the ring because her transaction came after the retailer made a  business decision  to stop selling items with the Confederate flag on it.Via: FOX News",Government News,"Jul 11, 2015"
 Joy Behar STUNS Audience As She Calls Donald Trump Out For Treason (VIDEO),"While discussing Donald Trump on ABC s The View, the ladies all had very strong opinions about Donald Trump, and to be honest, none of them are good, and with good reason.They discussed his blatant racism to the tragedy that unfolded at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. They also discussed Trump s horrific rhetoric surrounding the event, and how he wrongfully went after President Obama.Joy Behar then interjects with a question that should make everyone think long and hard about Trump s use of language: Do you think that because he is the  recruiter-in-chief,  and by his words he s getting more people to go on the side of ISIS, that he could be considered treasonous? It was then that an audible gasp can be heard from the crowd, either from those in agreement, or those stunned that she would say such a thing. But here s the thing   she s not wrong.Trump s vile rhetoric is being used in recruitment videos by ISIS, so not only is he not cut out to be Commander-in-Chief, but his remarks are actually being used in an upsurge in violence against the very nation he wishes to lead.Treason, by definition, is the crime of betraying one s country, and by aiding ISIS with his language, he could be considered doing just that.So, Joy, very good question.Watch the ladies of The View go after Trump here:Our co-hosts react to Donald Trump s proposed immigration ban post Orlando shooting: https://t.co/WmNRJ4e4ZY  The View (@TheView) June 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 14, 2016"
 More Than HALF Of Americans Agree Trump Is Going To Be A HORRIBLE Failure As President,"Even though Donald Trump projects his own narcissistic confidence that he ll be a great president, most Americans disagree.A new Gallup poll shows that the American people do not believe Trump will be able to handle the responsibilities of the presidency.According to Gallup,As Donald Trump prepares to take the presidential oath on Jan. 20, less than half of Americans are confident in his ability to handle an international crisis (46%), to use military force wisely (47%) or to prevent major scandals in his administration (44%). At least seven in 10 Americans were confident in Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in these areas before they took office.So Donald Trump is entering office with far less support than other presidents have in recent years.Trump s vindictive and divisive behavior combined with his bad temper and utter disregard for established foreign policy are making Americans nervous about how he will respond if a foreign nation merely criticizes him.Trump s predecessors, on the other hand, enjoyed a solid majority of public confidence to do the job. And that includes President George W. Bush.The deficits in Trump s ratings relative to his predecessors  are largely because of the low scores he gets from supporters of the opposing party. On average, 21% of Democrats have confidence in Trump across the five presidential duties for which Americans also rated Bush and Obama (all except handling the economy and defending U.S. interests abroad). By contrast, for the same five areas, an average of 60% of Republicans were confident in Obama and an average of 57% of Democrats were confident in Bush. These data underscore the much more polarized partisan environment in which Trump will be taking office.Donald trump may believe that everyone likes him but the results clearly show, like the popular vote, that Americans really despise him.Also, as Trump enters the White House with an approval rating below 50 percent, President Obama is exiting the office with an approval rating of 55 percent, one of the highest on record for a president leaving office and higher than the historical average.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"January 2, 2017"
"HARD-CORE, CONSERVATIVE, Street Artist, Sabo Videotapes Visit From Secret Service…Who Is This Guy?

He has been a loyal supporter for years. This piece of art he created illustrates the kick ass, take-no-prisoners style of Ted Cruz that both the GOP and Left despise: Here is an interview with Glenn Beck that explains what motivates Sabo, and why he chose to use street art to get a conservative message out to Americans:Is it any wonder when Sabo saw this message from Obama s Secret Service hanging on his door, he wasn t too surprised?

"Zbigniew Brzezinski, Globalist Scion, Dies at Age 89","21st Century WireZbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and founding member of the Trilateral Commission, died yesterday at the age of 89.Arguably one of the most influential thinkers and authors of the 20th and early 21st centuries, Brzezinski is regarded by many as the vanguard of modern globalism and the architect of the new world order.Brzezinski s two seminal publications, Between Two Ages and The Grand Chessboard are near blueprints of how globalization and geopolitics has progressed in the post-WWII world under an international system of Anglo-American economic and political hegemony.Brzezinski was born in Warsaw, Poland and attended university in both Canada and the US. In mainstream politics, Brzezinski first came to prominence in the early 1960 s as adviser to president John F. Kennedy and later with his successor Lyndon B. Johnson.During his tenure as chief national security advisor to president Jimmy Carter began in 1976, Brzezinski is said to have helped to broker the Panama Canal treaty, as well as Camp David negotiations between Israeli and Egyptian leaders, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat. He is also credited with opening up China to the West, and helping to topple the Soviet Union.In his final years, Brzezinski s efforts focused on the US-EU project to encircle and isolate Russia by pulling former Soviet republics and Balkan countries under the umbrella of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).READ MORE NWO NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NWO FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"May 27, 2017"
YIKES! NEW BILL CLINTON RAPE Details Emerge: “Her mouth was all swollen up…It was cut…Her pantyhose were all ripped”,"Hillary s all about protecting women who are victims of rape unless of course her husband is the accused rapist In her first extensive interview in over a decade, the nurse who found Juanita Broaddrick in her hotel room immediately after Bill Clinton allegedly raped Broaddrick recounted what she says she witnessed in that room 38 years ago. She was crying,  recalled Norma Rogers, a nurse who worked for Broaddrick, who at the time was a nursing home administrator volunteering for then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton s 1978 gubernatorial bid. And the thing I think I remember most is that her mouth was all swollen up. It was cut.   Her pantyhose were all ripped,  Rogers stated in dramatic, lengthy new testimony.Rogers drove Broaddrick back home after the incident. This week, she recounted that emotional drive.  I think we stopped at least twice to get ice. I would go up and get fresh ice and put it on her mouth because she was trying to keep her face from bruising and looking like something bad had happened to her, you know. It was just crazy. The whole situation was just crazy. Rogers was speaking in a lengthy interview on this reporter s talk radio program,  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  broadcast on New York s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.Events leading to incidentRogers took listeners back to the spring of 1978 when she traveled to Little Rock for an industry convention along with her nursing home boss, Broaddrick. The two shared a room at the city s Camelot Hotel.In an interview with me in November, Broaddrick herself provided background on her personal encounters with Clinton leading up to that infamous day.Broaddrick said Clinton previously singled her out during a campaign stop at her nursing home.  He would just sort of insinuate, you know when you are in Little Rock let s get together. Let s talk about the industry. Let s talk about the needs of the nursing homes and I was very excited about that. Broaddrick said she finally took Clinton up on that offer when she traveled to Little Rock with Rogers for the convention.Broaddrick says she phoned Clinton s campaign headquarters to inform him of her arrival and was told by a receptionist that Clinton had left instructions for her to reach him at his private apartment. I called his apartment and he answered,  Broaddrick recounted during our November interview.  And he said,  Well, why don t we meet in the Camelot Hotel coffee room and we can get together there and talk.  And I said  That would be fine. Clinton then changed the meeting location from the hotel coffee shop to Broaddrick s room. A time later and I m not sure how long it was, he called my room, which he said he would do when he got to the coffee shop. And he said,  There are too many people down here. It s too crowded. There s reporters and can we just meet in your room? And it sort of took me back a little bit, Aaron,  she said of Clinton s request. But I did say, okay, I ll order coffee to the room, which I did and that s when things sort of got out of hand. And it was very unexpected. It was, you might even say, brutal. With the biting of my lip. In the new interview, Rogers confirmed Broaddrick s version of events:I just know when I left that morning it was my understanding that she was going to be meeting with Mr. Clinton downstairs in the coffee shop for a meeting that they had planned ahead of time to discuss nursing home issues.Bloody lip. Ripped pantyhose. State of shock.Broaddrick previously recounted the aftermath of the incident, when her friend Rogers came back to the room after Broaddrick failed to show up to the convention.In our radio interview, Rogers recounted what she says she saw upon entering the room.I went back to the room and I can t remember if it was because she didn t come down to the meeting because I expected her to have a short meeting and then come to the meeting. And so I went back up to the room and when I went back into the room and she was just very, very upset. She was crying.And the thing I think I remember most is that her mouth was all swollen up. It was cut. And she just told me. She started then telling me the story of how he had just basically overtaken her and bit her lip in order to keep her quiet and to keep her from trying to leave or get away from him. And then she proceeded to tell me that he had pushed her onto the bed, and had raped her.Her pantyhose were all ripped. And she was just in a terrible state. Crying and just, she began telling me, you know, what had happened.But in the meantime she was starting to get her things together and she said we are leaving now. And you know we just started getting our stuff together and I drove her home.Asked whether Broaddrick s lip was bleeding, Rogers replied,  There were obviously open spots where he had bitten her. It was open but not openly bleeding. You know it was just open spots on her lip. Read entire story here: Breitbart News",left-news,"Sep 14, 2016"

 WATCH: Republican Calls Town Hall Crowd ‘Children’ After They Boo His Lies About Affordable Care Act,"Republicans are still pushing the lie that the Affordable Care Act includes  death panels. Back in 2009, Sarah Palin repeatedly claimed that President Obama s signature healthcare law forces elderly people to go before panels to decide whether they get medical care or not. Other Republicans soon started making the same claim even though there is no such thing as  death panels  in the law.Politifact even rated the lie as their  Lie of the Year  in 2009.But even though Palin s  death panel  claim was declared a lie by fact-checkers in 2009, Republicans are still repeating it in 2017 to justify repealing the healthcare law that provides health insurance to 30 million Americans.During a town hall meeting held by GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis in Florida on Saturday, Republican county secretary Bill Akins took the stage and repeated the  death panel  lie to the constituents who packed the room. Here s the problem I have with the Affordable Care Act,  Akins said.  Number one, there is a provision in there that anyone over the age of 74 has to go before what is effectively a death panel. Bilirakis  constituents immediately roared in disapproval. Yes, they do,  Akin continued.  It s in there, folks. You re wrong. The audience knew that Akins was lying and began booing him and calling him out. Akin insisted that the provision is real, but the crowd would have none of it.Akin then proceeded to insult the crowd by calling them  children. Okay, children,  he said, taunting them further.  Alright, children. Here s the video via YouTube.So, a Republican literally just insulted the constituents of a fellow Republican. Yeah, that s totally not going to bite Bilirakis on the ass when the next election comes around.Akin s response to the crowd demonstrates exactly what Republicans think of the American people, especially citizens who criticize them or dare to call them out on their lies.The fact is that there are no death panels in the Affordable Care Act. However, Donald Trump is trying to turn Medicaid into an actual death panel program and this is something Republicans in Congress apparently support.Trump s plan would turn Medicaid into a block grant program where each state gets a certain amount of money for healthcare. When the money runs out, states would have to decide who gets medical care and who doesn t.

" WATCH: Teacher Whitesplains His Use Of ‘N***er’ To Black Student, Fails MISERABLY (VIDEO)","Just when you think you ve seen everything, a video pops up online showing a white teacher trying to explain to a black student that it s okay to use the n-word.In Louisiana, at Ben Franklin High School, a teacher referenced as  Coach Ryan  is seen on video in a heated discussion with a black student. The student is clearly upset with the teacher and would like Coach Ryan to stop using the n-word.The teacher even went so far as to say that it s a  commoditized word  that holds no negative meaning anymore and that people need to move on from thinking that it s bad.You can hear the student say: That s racist as sh*t. Why can you not understand that it s racist for a white man to say  n***er  to a black man? It s f*cking racist. Watch the interaction here:It s unbelievable, yet unfortunately believable, that a teacher in the year 2017 would not only think that it s okay to use the n-word, but to also try to argue with a black student about it, and insist that it s not racist.The Root reports: According to the TImes-Picayune, students went to the principal s office after class with the intent of staging a sit-in that instead turned into an hourlong assembly.Videos and photos of the assembly circulated on social media, too, with a different student talking about the stigma that black people face in society. It s good that a great discussion stemmed from such a profoundly awful situation, but hopefully, that teacher has also been reprimanded for his insanely derogatory speech. When our educators are trying to educate that racism is okay, that s not okay at all.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 5, 2017"
"WOW! REFUGEES EXPOSED: Here’s the cold hard truth the media won’t tell you…“If Saudi Arabia is refusing to accept them because they are a national security threat, why are we accepting them?” [VIDEO]","Brigitte Gabriel is an intelligent and important voice of reason when it comes to the subject of Muslim refugees who are migrating West. She is the Founder and President of Act for America. She is one of the leading national security experts in the world -providing information and analysis on the rise of Islamic terrorism. Ms. Gabriel lectures nationally and internationally about national security and current affairs. Her expertise is sought after by world and business leaders.Gabriel is a Christian born who was born and raised in Lebanon. Her story is very compelling, and serves as a warning to Americans who are fighting to keep the flow of unvetted refugees coming into the United States:  I lost my country of birth to radical Islam   I do not want to lose my adopted country, America. Gabriel declared.Muslims started coming to Lebanon so their children could study at the country s universities. They also stayed to work in their economy.  We built refugee camps for them in Lebanon, we took them in because we wanted to take care of them, but these people turned against us, and they destroyed our country,  Gabriel recalled, bitterly. She said the tipping point was when Muslims became the majority population. Lebanon went from being  the Eden of the Middle East  to being the terrorist pit of the Middle East,  she declared. The country is run by a terrorist organization, and has no rule of law. Currently, there is not even a president in Lebanon, as none has been elected.  They are drowning in their own garbage, the government is falling apart. This is what happens when you import people into your country that do not share your values   that do not share your idea of freedom or democracy, your idea of tolerance,  Gabriel explained.Gabriel did not deny the charitable impulse of helping people in need.  We can still do humanitarian work, but we need to make sure we are protected first,  she declared. We know ISIS infiltrated them, they were coming here under the disguise of refugees, but they are actually ISIS recruiters and ISIS sympathizers,  Gabriel told PJ Media in an interview at the Values Voter Summit on Saturday. She added that the refugees  are making up names   they can tell us anything, and there is nothing we can do to check it. These people don t have passports. We don t even know if the name they give is their real name,  Gabriel explained. The refugees also are not just coming from embattled countries like Syria and Iraq, she argued. They also come from Tunisia, Libya, Eritrea, Djibouti and Afghanistan   migrants fleeing poor countries to go to rich countries.Gabriel argued that the refugees must have a reason for going further west, as opposed to other countries in the Middle East.  These refugees can go to any country in the region, where they speak the Arabic language, where their children can assimilate and continue in their schooling with Arabic schools. Why are they coming to Europe? One reason, she alleged, is that  the word got out that if you want a freebie, this is the opportunity to come to Europe and live off the government. Perhaps more importantly, however, many Middle Eastern countries would turn the migrants away.  Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country and a very big country   they have a lot of space,  Gabriel noted. She explained that Saudi Arabia, Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait are refusing to accept these refugees because  they are a national security threat.  When Arabic countries suspect terror activity from the refugees, why should we overlook it? If Saudi Arabia is refusing to accept them because they are a national security threat, why are we accepting them?  Gabriel asked.  Are we that dumb? Watch Gabriel as she exposes the truth about the refugees we are bringing to America: It is not difficult to see how the tens of thousands of refugees who have entered Europe and other western countries recently are having a devastating impact in their host nations. Areas holding these refugees have seen an increase in rape, theft, gang activity, intimidation, and organized crime. Media in Europe have reported that thousands of the refugees have disappeared   and are unaccounted for. Terror groups such as the Islamic State publicly announce how they are using refugees as cover to infiltrate the West.An Egyptian-American made this interesting comment under the video. He gives us an idea of what it s like to be a Christian in a Muslim dominated nation:Ms. Gabriel has addressed the United Nations, the Australian Prime Minister, members of the British Parliament/House of Commons, members of the United States Congress, the Pentagon, the Joint Forces Staff College, the U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. Asymmetric Warfare group, the FBI, and many others.She speaks Arabic, French, English and Hebrew.",politics,"Jan 31, 2017"

5 KEY THINGS To Know About Obama’s Supreme Court Nominee…One Is A BIG Deal Breaker!,"The Senate had better stick to their guns on this! They say they will not bring up Merrick Garland for a vote as a Supreme Court Nominee but will wait for the new administration. McConnell is done if he goes back on his word. He spoke on the Senate floor today to say that the Senate will not take up this vote. SIX REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY LL MEET WITH GARLAND:Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio)One of the five things below is a BIG deal breaker Judge Garland is anti-Second Amendment 1. Garland is considered anti-Second Amendment. As the National Review noted last week:  Back in 2007, Judge Garland voted to undo a D.C. Circuit court decision striking down one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation  and voted  to uphold an illegal Clinton-era regulation that created an improvised gun registration requirement.  Obama will use his pick to pursue a gun control agenda.2. Garland has favored environmental regulations. As SCOTUSblog noted in 2010:  On environmental law, Judge Garland has in a number of cases favored contested EPA regulations and actions when challenged by industry, and in other cases he has accepted challenges brought by environmental groups.  That could be very important, with Obama s Clean Power Plan in the balance.3. Garland s positions on abortion and social issues are murky. Some liberals are worried that Garland may not be unambiguously pro-choice. Richard Wolf of USA Today writes:  During 19 years at the D.C. Circuit, Garland has managed to keep a low profile. The court s largely administrative docket has left him without known positions on issues such as abortion or the death penalty. 4. Garland would maintain the Court s demographic profile. He is the second Chicagoan Obama has nominated. He is no  wise Latina,  and is the first man Obama has chosen. But Garland, like Scalia, is a graduate of Harvard Law, keeping the number of Crimson justices at five. If confirmed, he would also be the fourth Jew on the Court, preserving the odd exclusion of evangelical Protestants.5. Republicans have supported Garland in the past. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) in particular has been outspoken in his support for Garland as the best Republicans could expect from the Clinton administration. More recently, he suggested he would welcome Garland s nomination but predicted that Obama would make a more ideological pick. That makes Garland harder for the GOP to oppose.Via: Breitbart",politics,"Mar 16, 2016"
 Whoops: VA Gun Shop Employee Accidentally Shoots Herself,"An employee of Safeside Tactical in Roanoke, Virginia accidentally shot herself in the leg on Thursday, May 6 during a private event being held inside the gun store. According to local station WDBJ7, the shooting took place just before noon, while the business was closed to the public.Roanoke City Police Department and Roanoke Fire EMS were called to the scene. The shooting victim was transferred to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where she is being treated for non life-threatening injuries.According to a statement released by the company, the injured employee works in an administrative position.The company stated: All of our employees undergo required firearm safety training upon hiring, and this unfortunate incident shows that even experienced firearm owners must be ever-vigilant and aware of the responsibilities associated with safe handling. According to the NRA, guns make for a safer society. Following that line of reasoning, a gun shop should be the safest place in the world. This is just one of many incidents where people have been accidentally or purposely injured by a firearm while surrounded by guns.On January 9, 2015, for example, four people were shot inside a gun store in Shawnee, Kansas.A few months later, a Fayetteville, NC man shot himself in the leg while attending a gun show.In November 2015, two men were shot at a gun show in Idaho when a vendor  accidentally fired a rifle. In January of this year, somewhere between one and three people were shot at a gun show in Ohio. Authorities were unable to determine the exact number of people who were shot at that event.Also in January of this year, two people were killed and two others injured during a father-son shootout at a gun store in Mississippi.All of the people involved in these shootings were surrounded by guns when they were injured or killed. Contrary to what the NRA says, being surrounded by guns does not make a person less likely to get shot. In fact, the opposite is true. The more guns that people have access to, the greater their risk of being injured or killed by one.Featured image via Ratha Grimes via Flickr cc 2.0 ",News,"May 6, 2016"
 Trump Property Already Made Over $400K From The Presidency,"Donald Trump rang in the New Year by already making a profit from the public office of the presidency, and he still has over two weeks until he is officially sworn in to the office. Trump made the money on New Years  Eve night through a party at his Florida estate/hotel, the very gaudily designed Mar-a-Lago.Unlike pretty much every other elected official, Trump s property charged admission to their event, and the incoming president was dangled like a shiny object in front of the patrons who pulled out their checkbooks to attend this event.According to Politico, Donald Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida charged a reported minimum of $525 per person for a New Year s Eve celebration that Trump and his family were set to attend. On Friday, Trump s incoming White House press secretary told reporters that the party was  sold out,  with over 800 guests expected at the event. That s more than $420,000 made off of dinner, dancing, and access to the incoming President of the United States.Incoming White House Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks attempted to dismiss concern that the Mar-a-Lago s pricy New Year s Eve Party comprised yet another conflict of interest issue for Trump.  The transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict,  she told Politico.  This is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election. Additionally, the president cannot and does not have a conflict. So far, the mainstream media has simply allowed Trump and his team the leeway to say  there is no conflict of interest,  in a manner that has more in common with Obi-wan Kenobi s Jedi mind trick from Star Wars than a truly responsive political team. But very few people outside of die-hard Trump supporters and his tight inner circle actually believe that this is a credible response to a serious inquiry.Trump and his squad will have to come up with more credible excuses   or, heaven forbid, stop being so crass and unethical   for inquiries to come from Democrats (most of them at least) and the media (maybe). It s  probably a safe bet, though, to assume that his fellow Republicans are perfectly fine with rubber-stamping his behavior as long as he has an (R) behind his name.Trump s behavior on this topic also calls into question his repeated assertion that he is a billionaire ten times over. He infamously refused to reveal his tax returns, and now he says and does anything to scrounge up a few hundred or thousand dollars seemingly everywhere he can. That isn t the behavior of a man with billions at his disposal at the drop of a hat. Is his quest for cash simply another area of vulnerability that will be exploited by either his own party, or by a foreign entity? We won t know, at least not in the immediate future.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 2, 2017"
TRUMP WAS RIGHT! Why The Heck Is This Liberal Political Hack Moderating Tonight’s Debate?,"If you watch CNBC at all you know John Harwood is a HUGE liberal political hack so why the heck is it ok for him to moderate tonight s debate? Couldn t they find anyone else? Look out for lots of jabs and unfair tactics focusing on the two frontrunners. It s fine to ask questions but these liberal animals will hit below the belt. Watch for it  Why in the world is liberal journalist John Harwood moderating Wednesday s Republican debate? And where the heck is his conservative media partner? Wednesday night s debate will be hosted by CNBC at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. It will be moderated by Harwood along with CNBC s Carl Quintanilla and Becky Quick and is supposed to focus on economic issues, though previous CNBC debates have strayed far from that topic. Harwood frequently angers conservatives for his partisan takes on the news. I mostly laugh off his predictably liberal views because I don t take him that seriously. But that only leads us back to figuring out why he s moderating this Wednesday s debate. Let s just look at a few examples of how he covers news. The Headlines Below Tell You Most of What You Need to Know: Harwood works for both CNBC and The New York Times.

James Clapper Himself Debunks “Russia Hacked US Election” Meme,"21st Century Wire says We ve seen it over and over again in the mainstream media,  Russia Hacked the US Election.  It has been a pervasive meme in the media ever since Donald J. Trump won the US Presidential election and it inspires consumers of mainstream media to believe that Russia actually used cyber intelligence agents to hack into the computers that are used to track the voting. Surveys show that many Americans believe that there was a literal computer hack of the election to change the results.Americans who believe this are duped by a false meme that has been bludgeoned into their psyches by their mainstream media outlets. James Clapper, head of all US intelligence, admitted while speaking at the Congressional Armed Services Committee that Russia had no hand in changing the vote tallies and did  nothing of that sort. Washingtons Blog reports Due to incredibly sloppy reporting by the mainstream media   constantly repeating the phrase  Russia hacked the election    many Americans believed that Russia literally changed votes on election day.A YouGov poll from last month found that half of all Democrats believe that Russia directly tampered with vote tallies:But today, the head of all U.S. intelligence   James Clapper   told Congress (specifically the Armed Services Committee): They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort.

 WATCH: GOP Congressman Goes Full RACIST On First Night Of Convention,"Republican congressman Steve King (IA) launched into the first night of the Republican National Convention with a racist tirade on MSNBC. He made the argument that white people have contributed the most to civilization, and downplayed what other races have done.King told the members of a panel on the network in response to a comment about how much older and whiter the convention audience is than most of America: I d ask you to go back to your history and figure out where these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you re talking about. Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization? King went on to praise  western civilization itself  as solely the product of whites, citing western Europe and the United States as the product of white ingeniuity.The congressman failed to note the myriad of contributions made by blacks, Latinos, Asians, and other races, or that many of the white contributions he cited were made at the expense of slave labor using blacks, especially in the United States.King, who has been ranked one of the least effective members of Congress, has a history of controversial and off-the-wall comments. King defended candidate Todd Akin after he said a woman with a  legitimate rape  would have her body  shut down  to prevent pregnancy.When he opposed immigration reform, King notoriously said: For every one who s a valedictorian, there s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. Opposing President Obama in 2008, King said: I will tell you that, if he is elected president, then the radical Islamists, the al-Qaida, the radical Islamists and their supporters, will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11. Slamming affirmative action, King said,: There s been legislation that s been brought through this House that sets aside benefits for women and minorities. The only people that it excludes are white men Pretty soon, white men are going to notice they are the ones being excluded. So these racist comments, in the context of one of the most explicitly racist campaigns from either party, are nothing new in Steve King s resume.Featured image via screen capture",News,"July 18, 2016"
 Swedish Police APPALLED At Level Of Deception In Film Trump Blamed For His ‘Terror Attack’ Lie,"When Donald Trump pulled a terror attack in Sweden out of his ass at a Florida rally over the weekend, he tried to cover his lie by saying he was referencing a documentary about rising crime in Sweden. That documentary blames Sweden s immigrant and refugee population for the crime, and Fox News  Tucker Carlson ran a portion of an interview between filmmaker Ami Horowitz and a couple of Swedish police officers from that documentary.And what Horowitz did with it has these two officers in complete shock. Horowitz says that Muslim refugees are responsible for a sharp increase in gun violence and rape, which is the basis of his documentary. One officer says that the interview was about areas with high rates of crime, but there was no focus on migration or immigration: We don t stand behind it. It shocked us. He has edited the answers. We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism. Paranoia and racism generally make for bad journalism, but fear-mongering conservatives don t seem to care. Tucker Carlson should have known better than to air a segment to push the right s anti-immigrant agenda, but he didn t. And Horowitz is trying to defend his  investigation  despite the horror his own interview subjects have expressed over the editing. He even claims he told them this would be about migrants and immigrants.But Horowitz also claims that the officers are the ones who used the term  no-go zones  to describe communities that have large Muslim-immigrant populations. For the record,  no-go zones  has been a rumor circulating around conservative media for quite some time   they like to claim that these zones are only open to Muslims, and some of them are so strict that any non-Muslim caught there faces punishment under Sharia law, and outside of the country s law. Local police are said to avoid these areas entirely.It s also a flat-out lie.But Horowitz tried to reclaim some credibility by saying his  record stands for itself: I ve never had a subject claim, and certainly not prove, that I ever misled them or ever doctored the footage. It s never happened before. So, my record stands for itself, and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself. The big question is, what possible motive would these two officers have to discredit Horowitz and Fox News? Horowitz says their bosses pressured them to disavow the interviews so they wouldn t be labeled racists. That s not likely true because, if nothing else, the data shows that despite the spike in migrants in Sweden over the last several years, crime has not similarly risen, let alone skyrocketed.You have a problem when your interview subjects say,  That s not what we said, that s not what we meant, that s not even what we were asked about.  Horowitz and Carlson owe the world an apology, but it seems that conservative personalities increasingly believe personal responsibility only applies to other people.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"February 21, 2017"
FORMER SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER Goes Low…Calls Two Republicans ‘A–holes’,"What s gotten into John Boehner? He gave a strange interview to left-leaning Politico and unloaded on former colleagues. During the interview he claimed he held no grudges against his former colleagues yet he called a few of them  a holes . Was he drunk? He also got into it on twitter with Sean Hannity and Hannity shot back questioning whether Boehner had been drinking Perhaps Hannity is on to something.John were you sober when you said this? That conversation never happened. I m sorry you are bitter and u failed! https://t.co/SLquw7rXZv  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 30, 2017Boehner gave a lengthy interview and even went after other conservative talk radio hosts: I always liked Rush. When I went to Palm Beach, I would always meet with Rush and we d go play golf. But you know, who was that right-wing guy, Levin? He went really crazy right and got a big audience, and he dragged Hannity to the dark side. He dragged Rush to the dark side. And these guys   I used to talk to them all the time. And suddenly they re beating the living s  out of me. TRUE COLORS?Why is John Boehner suddenly attacking his fellow Republicans? Jordan is a valued member of Congress and isn t a RINO so maybe Boehner has it out for him.Former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a new profile from Politico on Sunday that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz(R-Utah) are  a holes. The former speaker made the comment while discussing Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) likely becoming the chair of the House Oversight Committee, a position Gowdy eventually earned.Chaffetz, the previous chair, had recently announced his resignation from Congress at the time of the interview. Jordan, who was also on the committee, was reportedly considering going out for the chairmanship. Gowdy   that s my guy, even though he doesn t know how to dress,  John Boehner told Politico.  F  Jordan. F  Chaffetz. They re both a holes. Boehner also called Chaffetz a  total phony  who was obsessed with promoting himself while in Congress. With Chaffetz it s always about Chaffetz,  Boehner told Politico.Chaffetz resigned from Congress in June and joined Fox News as a contributor.Boehner also criticized Jordan, who helped found the House s Freedom Caucus, which was part of the movement to push Boehner out as speaker: Jordan was a terrorist as a legislator going back to his days in the Ohio House and Senate,  Boehner told Politico.  A terrorist. A legislative terrorist. Last July, Boehner also spoke out against Jordan:Former House Speaker John Boehner assailed GOP House arch conservatives led by Rep. Jim Jordan as the  knucklehead caucus,  calling them  anarchists  who are  for nothing. In a speech from a private gathering in Las Vegas casino/resort, the West Chester Republican took aim at the conservatives who pushed him from office at the end of 2015. Among those was Jordan, R-Urbana, who revolted against Boehner, even though he was the first speaker from Ohio since Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1931.Boehner was asked to explain why House Republicans did not support House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to succeed Boehner as speaker. The knucklehead caucus decided they weren t going to vote for him,  Boehner said.  Now these are the guys in the Republican Party you could call right of right. They are anarachists. They re for nothing. The video of Boehner was obtained by The Washington Post. Although he did not mention Jordan by name, it was clear Boehner was referring to him.Read more: The Hill",politics,"Oct 30, 2017"
Germany’s Angela Merkel Makes Incredibly Naive Announcement: EVERY MIGRANT MUST LEAVE…After THIS One Condition Is Met…,"Perhaps Merkel should have considered the serious consequences of Germany s compassionate open border policy that allowed over 1 million (mostly) Muslim males to infiltrate their country. German officials essentially granted them permission to rape and sexually assault their women and children while they looked the other way. But that s not all Germany is giving them free food, housing, education and spending money to boot. Does Angela Merkel really believe that when she tells these freeloading Muslim males that it s time to go back home, that they re going to pack up their bags and leave? As Germany s open-door refugee policy comes increasingly under fire, the Chancellor has tried to silence her critics.Despite mounting pressure to cap the number of refugees in the wake of the Cologne sex attacks which saw 130 women sexually assaulted by men, believed to be migrants, Mrs Merkel has stood her ground.Some 1.1million migrants entered Germany last year, many fleeing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.Mrs Merkel said:  We need   to say to people that this is a temporary residential status and we expect that, once there is peace in Syria again, once ISIS has been defeated in Iraq, that you go back to your home country with the knowledge that you have gained. Mrs Merkel said 70 per cent of the refugees who fled to Germany from former Yugoslavia in the 1990s had returned.She urged other European countries to offer more help  because the numbers need to be reduced even further and must not start to rise again, especially in spring .Speaking to a regional meeting of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Mrs Merkel said said all EU states should have an interest in protecting the bloc s external borders, and all would suffer if the internal passport-free Schengen zone collapsed and national borders were closed.Peter Altmaier, who Mrs Merkel has tasked with overseeing the government s handling of the refugee crisis, said the government was negotiating with some countries including Turkey about taking back criminal refugees who arrived via non-EU countries.Yeah because what nation in their right mind wouldn t gladly accept  criminal refugees  into their country? Gee, we sure hope Merkel isn t foolish enough to believe there aren t any members of ISIS living comfortably in refugee housing or camps inside their open-borders.Via: Express UK ",politics,"Feb 2, 2016"
 WATCH: Fox SCRAMBLES To Refute Wiretapping Claim After Trump Throws Them Under The Bus,"Fox News found themselves in a really uncomfortable position on Friday because of Donald Trump s gullibility.During a Fox News broadcast on Tuesday, Andrew Napolitano attempted to defend Trump s continuing insistence that President Obama wiretapped him by accusing the British intelligence agency GCHQ of wiretapping Trump after being ordered to do so by Obama.Just like Trump s original accusation, Napolitano s accusation was just as wild and baseless. Yet, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer repeated it as gospel without providing any evidence to back up the claim.In a rare statement issued by the GCHQ, the agency angrily refuted the accusation. Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct  wiretapping  against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. The international incident reportedly forced Spicer and National Security Adviser McMaster to issue a formal apology to the United Kingdom, even though Spicer and Trump have not publicly backed away from the accusation in the United States.The embarrassing incident was rightfully brought up by reporters during a joint press conference on Friday attended by Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.When asked if the White House made a mistake blaming the British, Trump literally blamed his favorite propaganda network for the an accusation his team repeated, thus throwing them under the bus. Trump also had the audacity to claim his team made no such allegation even though his team openly repeated it as if it somehow proved Trump s original accusation. We said nothing,  Trump said.  All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. So you shouldn t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. Here s the video via Twitter.Wow. Trump to Merkel about alleged wiretapping by Obama:  At least we have something in common, perhaps.  She appears to be very confused. pic.twitter.com/la4p9ZJGvo  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017Almost immediately, Fox News rushed to reverse the damage as anchor Shep Smith told the world that Napolitano was full of shit. Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano s commentary,  Smith said.  Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-President of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way. Full stop. And then Fox anchor Bret Baier chimed in later in the day by repeating that Napolitano s claim cannot be confirmed. We love the judge, we love him here at Fox, but the Fox News division was never able to back up those claims and was never reported on this show,  Baier reported.While Napolitano was irresponsible for pitching such an accusation, Donald Trump was even more irresponsible by letting Spicer repeat it without any verification of the accuracy of the claim. All Trump had to do is direct his team to make contact with British intelligence and ask if the claim is true or not. But Trump failed to do so because he is flailing for anything that could even suggest in the slightest that his accusation against President Obama is true. But the accusation is clearly false because if Trump really had any proof he would have released it by now. Even Republican leaders in Congress have confirmed that Trump s claim is a lie.So it looks like the honeymoon may be over between Trump and Fox News. It s probably safe to say that Fox News will put a leash on what their commentators say about Trump s wiretapping fiasco. Now we just have to wait and see if Fox News starts to turn on Trump.Featured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"March 17, 2017"
 Howard Dean Just Doubled Down On Trump’s Possible Cocaine Use (VIDEO),"Allow me to begin by saying former DNC chair Howard Dean is the f*cking man. After tweeting that Donald Trump might be on cocaine   a reasonable observation based on the GOP s actions during the first presidential debate   he could have backed down under scrutiny. He could have caved and apologized. Instead, he made his case.Dean, a physician who is qualified to speculate   though in his own words not diagnose without examining Trump in person   responded to criticism of his remarks on MSNBC. I don t make diagnosis on the television, it s medically improper,  he told Kate Snow Tuesday, a subtle jab at Trump and his legion of Fox News  doctors  feverishly trying to diagnose Clinton with every neurological disorder under the sun because she coughed that one time and contracted pneumonia the other.  But I don t think this was a ridiculous idea. Something funny was going on with Trump last night. Something  ridiculous  was indeed going on. Trump spent his evening screaming about ridiculous conspiracy theories, attacking his opponent s  stamina  based on a minor illness, interrupting Clinton constantly, guzzling water, sweating profusely, and other things that would be expected from his meth-addled Twitter followers rather than a serious presidential candidate. Here s the interesting constellation: he sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do. He also has grandiosity, which is something that accompanies that problem. He has delusions, I m not talking about being crazy, but for example when he told everybody he was very smart not to pay taxes and then denied that he said after he said it it in front of 100 million people,  Dean said.  He thinks somehow he s not going to get caught, that is delusional. He has trouble with pressured speech,  the former Vermont governor added.  He interrupted, as you pointed out, Hillary Clinton twenty-nine times. He couldn t keep himself together. Do I think at 70 years old he has a cocaine habit? Probably not,  Dean concludes. But it s something that I think would be interesting to ask him, to see if he ever had a problem with that. Asked for clarification if he thinks Trump has a  cocaine habit,  Dean replied  I don t think he has a cocaine habit,  placing special emphasis on the word  habit.  In other words, it might be a stretch to say Trump is addicted to cocaine, but it is possible that he used it to pep himself up before the debate.In an effort to deflect from the allegation, Trump assured the public that he just had a cold, but Stephen Colbert put it best when he said The Donald  sounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine. We can t know for sure if Trump has ever been treated for addiction, as he refuses to release his records   and since Trump should be held to the same standards to which he holds Hillary Clinton, it s not unreasonable to question if he has been using cocaine (especially given the crazy, whacked-out bonkers stuff he says in public).Watch Dean SLAY this interview below:Featured image via screengrab, Getty Images (Joe Raedle)",News,"September 27, 2016"
Why Donald J. Trump Is The Only One Who Can Defeat An Anti-American Party That’s Gone Unopposed For 50 Years ,"Every American should read and share this brilliant article.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fightsHE FIGHTSMy Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I m not bothered by Donald Trump s lack of decorum. They ask if I don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office.  Here s my answer:We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as John McCain? We tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same.This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.I don t find anything  dignified,   collegial  or  proper  about Barack Obama s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don t see anything  statesman-like  in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified,   collegial  or  proper. The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the  60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take-over of the universities   till today.The problem is, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality and propriety.With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America s first wartime president in the Culture War.During wartime, things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that,  I cannot spare this man. He fights. General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.Trump is fighting. And what s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel s, he s shouting,  You magnificent bastards, I read your book!  That is just the icing on the cake, but it s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he s defeating the Left using their own tactics.That book is Saul Alinsky s Rules for Radicals   a book so essential to the Liberals  war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.Trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri   Trump has isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all. Everyone gets that it s not just CNN   in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than CNN s   CNN is just a piker.Most importantly, Trump s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices.They can either  go high  (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery.The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright s, church.Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration s cover-up. This makes  going high  a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than Nixon. This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before, and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media.And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case  l ) libel laws protecting the media, they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly.Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their  deal  with him public.Instead, CNN   playing by  Chicago Rules    was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fights.Townhall published this brilliant article on July 13, 2017.

 Donald Trump’s Hollywood Walk Of Fame Star Defaced With Brilliantly Appropriate Symbol (IMAGE),"Donald Trump is about as a racist as they come, no matter his claims to the contrary. His entire campaign has been a nod to the most vile elements of white supremacy and all manner of bigotry that the bowels of American culture has to offer. After all, he kicked off his circus of a campaign by declaring that  all Mexican immigrants are rapists, and later called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States   even those who are citizens but simply traveling abroad.These examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Trump s racist rhetoric, and some brilliant person decided to call Trump out for what he is in an amazingly brilliant way: by defacing his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a swastika. The vandalism apparently occurred on Friday and has since been cleaned up   but not before someone snapped a photo of it and uploaded it to social media site Reddit. Here is the image:Via RedditWhoever did this deserves a medal. Trump s rhetoric is definitely reminiscent of the tone that was the preamble for the horrors that occurred in Nazi Germany, and it needs to be called out for what it is.To the anonymous brave American who did this   sincerely, thank you.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 2, 2016"

" Desperate MI Governor Tries Claiming Flint Poisoning Was ‘Natural Disaster’, Obama Slaps Him Down","Michigan Governor Rick Snyder is still desperately clinging to his job, but there are signs that his fingers are slipping.For weeks, the country has been learning with growing horror the depths to which Snyder s administration sank to save a few bucks. A startling picture has finally come into focus: Rather than listen to scientists and residents, Michigan s state government decided to simply ignore all signs that the water system in the city of Flint was beginning to corrode away. As a result, dangerous chemicals including lead had begun pouring into the drinking water. The fix to prevent a mass poisoning of residents from their tap water would have cost barely anything, but they gambled it all   and Flint lost.As early as October 2014, there were problematic signs. A local General Motors engine plant stopped using water from the Flint river because parts were becoming rusted, but officials nevertheless continued to reassure residents the water was safe to drink   a decision deemed  unconscionable  by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton this week.Tests also revealed elevated levels of chemical compounds in the water supply that can lead to liver or kidney issues. Nonetheless, officials downplayed residents  concerns, saying   confidently   that the water was safe to drink.How bad was the lead poisoning in Flint s water? Ten people have died from drinking it. Doctors now warn that every child in Flint under the age of six   over 8,000 of them   must now be treated for lead poisoning. The long-term effects to their health and mental development won t be known for some time.It s gotten so bad that President Obama was forced to declare a federal emergency in Flint. National Guard troops have begun pouring into the state to help get water to people who can t trust their faucets not to kill them. Celebrities such as Cher and Michael Moore have flown in tens of thousands of bottles of water.Through it all, Michigan s Republican governor has spent almost all of his energy trying to spin this epic disaster as not his fault. Absolutely nobody is buying it.In a bold move, Hillary Clinton even used her time during the Democratic debate to put a spotlight on Flint and the failures of Snyder s administration. I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what s happening in Flint, Michigan, and I think every single American should be outraged. We ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care. Snyder responded to this forceful condemnation of his pathetic actions by giving a more pathetic response.Political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis.  Governor Rick Snyder (@onetoughnerd) January 18, 2016How convenient that the man that every finger is pointing to now believes finger pointing isn t important.Another person not buying Snyder s buck passing? President Obama. Snyder recently demanded the federal government give him $96 million in  natural disaster  aid money to help him pay for the fall out of his negligence. Obama, who has already pooled resources to help Flint residents out, said  No way. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator W. Craig Fugate, in a letter to Snyder, said his request for a major disaster declaration was denied because the water contamination  does not meet the legal definition of a  major disaster  under federal law. The incident was not the result of a natural catastrophe, nor was it created by a fire, flood or explosion,  Fugate said.This wasn t a hurricane or a tornado or a wildfire, this was a Republican Party that was so interested in turning a profit that they gambled with the lives of their constituents. Calling this a natural disaster would be one of the biggest political lies ever told.It should also be noted that while Snyder would like nearly 100 million dollars from the federal government   hypocritical coming from a small government conservative, no?   his state just posted a $575 million surplus. Flint s lawmakers have asked that some of that money be used to help out the city. So far Snyder hasn t offered it. As we ve seen time and again, a Republican governor wants nothing to do with the government until he needs its help to clean up one of his screw ups. President Obama and federal agencies routinely serve as punching bags for Republican politicians who pretend that government equals tyranny. Now, with a man-made disaster unfolding on his hands, Snyder is mad that this very same  tyrannical  government won t do more to help save him from himself.If Snyder wants help he should take responsibility and confess that it was his actions that brought on this water crisis. He can clarify that this wasn t a  natural disaster  in his resignation letter.Featured image via Michigan Municipal League/Flickr",News,"January 18, 2016"
New Survey Shows No.1 Fear of US Citizens is Government NOT Terrorism,"Americans have lost the plot when it comes to evaluating the true nature of the  terrorist threat  (Image Source: Wikicommons)By Matt AgoristAn extensive survey of hundreds of adults across the United States has just revealed that the thing most Americans fear more than anything else is their own government. In fact, according to the survey, no other fear even comes close to the percentage of Americans who worry about their corrupt government officials.The survey was conducted by Chapman University and it serves to back up the point that while Americans claim to live in the Land of the Free, deep down, they realize they are living in a corrupt oligarchy. The Chapman University Survey of American Fears Wave 4 (2017) provides an in-depth examination into the fears of average Americans. In May of 2017, a random sample of 1,207 adults from across the United States were asked their level of fear about eighty different fears across a huge variety of topics ranging from crime, the government, the environment, disasters, personal anxieties, technology and many others. As Statista s Niall McCarthy notes, like last year, corruption of government officials came top in 2017, with 74.5 percent of U.S. adults saying it makes them  afraid  or  very afraid. Despite the constant fear mongering from the mainstream media and government on bogeymen terrorists plotting to steal our freedom, the public, according to this survey, is not buying it.In fact, the threat of terrorism isn t even in the top 20 fears. Terrorism comes in at twenty-two below credit card fraud and identity theft.While this survey is certainly promising, in the idea that people are waking up to government corruption, it is also a telling sign of America s ability to hold two entirely contradictory ideas as self-evident.This ability, or perhaps better defined as  disability,  to hold two opposing ideas, such as the spreading of freedom through war, as being logically sound, is called cognitive dissonance. When one is in a state of dissonance, they may sometimes feel  disequilibrium : frustration, hunger, dread, guilt, anger, embarrassment, anxiety, etc.In order for cognitive dissonance to work, society must remain just ignorant enough to support and to believe the lies fed to them from the establishment as reality; even though this reality is a complete contradiction.Once we step back and observe society with this in mind, the reason for this contradictory mental state becomes quite obvious. It is much easier to remain delusional and in a state of suspended disbelief than it is to deal with the opposing ideas held inside one s head. How can one chant  USA is number #1!  while at the same time fearing the rulers of that USA?( ) If this survey shows us anything, it is that Americans would do well to entertain the uncomfortable idea that this country they hold so high up on a pedestal has actually long been on a path to become the dystopian nightmare written about in books like 1984.Americans would do well to remember the words by John Basil Barnhill in 1914 when he said, Where the people fear the government you have tyranny. Where the government fears the people you have liberty.

RARE INTERVIEW WITH WHITE HOUSE SECRETARY: Bill Clinton Had Affairs With “thousands of women”…”Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made”,"This is a mind-blowing interview that confirms much of what many of us suspected about the Clintons. For some, it may be even worse than what they believed to be true. Kudos to Linda Tripp for agreeing to do this interview. People who cross the Clinton s do usually fare too well In a rare interview, Linda Tripp, a pivotal figure in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, revealed on Sunday it was common knowledge while she worked in the West Wing that Bill Clinton had affairs with  thousands of women. Speaking on  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  Tripp for the first time divulged that she personally knew another White House staffer aside from Lewinsky who was also having an affair with Clinton. That unnamed staffer was mentioned by Tripp in various depositions but she has not spoken about it publicly.She charged that Hillary Clinton not only knew about her husband s exploits,  She made it her personal mission to disseminate information and destroy the women with whom he dallied. Tripp says she cringes at the sight of Clinton presenting herself as  a champion of women s rights worldwide in a global fashion, and yet all of the women she has destroyed over the years to ensure her political viability continues is sickening to me. Tripp documented evidence of Lewinsky s phone calls about her relationship with Bill Clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. She explained to Klein that she did so because she believed her own life and Lewinsky s were in danger, saying that Lewinsky was threatening Clinton with outing the relationship.Tripp also used the interview to criticize what she says is the news media s unwillingness to investigate the Clintons. She singled out and thanked Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report, declaring that without him  things would have been very, very different. Drudge s website was the first media outlet to break the Lewinsky scandal after Newsweek sat on the story.Tripp had unique access to the Clintons because her office was directly adjacent to Hillary s second floor West Wing office for the entire time she served in the Clinton White House from 1993 to the summer of 1994 with the exception of the first three months of the Clinton administration, when she sat just outside the Oval Office.Tripp s nonpartisan position was a carryover from the George H. W. Bush administration in which she served. Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made She told Klein that her role in the Lewinsky case followed  years of alarm at what I had seen in the Clinton White House, particularly Hillary and the different scandals, whether it was Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Vince Foster. All of the scandals that had come before and were so completely obliterated in the mind s eye of the American people because of the way all of them were essentially discounted. So I watched a lying President and a lying First Lady present falsehoods to the American people. So my dismay predated the January 1998 period when the Monica Lewinsky scandal surfaced. To me it was very important that the American people see what I was seeing. My years with the Clintons were so disturbing on so many levels. Tripp maintains that she went public with the Lewinsky evidence to ensure the intern s safety as well as her own.She told Klein:I say today and I will continue to say that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took. That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends.I think that had it not become public when it did, particularly in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, which was coming to a head with President Clinton s deposition, that we may well have met with an accident. It s a situation where unless you lived it as I did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation.Tripp said the young Lewinsky, 21-years-old when she entered the White House as an intern, was unaware of the danger that she faced.She described Lewinsky as a  young girl, smart, clever   but in this one area she was blinded and she fancied herself in love. He fancied himself entitled. It was nothing more than a servicing agreement. She romanticized that there was an affair. And when it didn t pan out the way she had hoped it would   he had promised her he would bring her back to the White House as soon as the 1996 election campaign had finished. When he didn t, she essentially lost her mind and started acting in erratic and frightening ways. Threatening the president.There came a point in July of 1997 when she not only threatened to expose the affair, as she referred to it. But also she at that time informed him that I knew all about it. So at that time it became dangerous for Monica and for me. This was something that absolutely could never see the light of day. And she never realized the implications of threatening a president or her behavior. And I did.Tripp told Klein that  the biggest fallacy that most people believed is that this was a unique occurrence. Monica was somehow special. And regrettably that s the farthest thing from the truth. She said,  Everyone knew within the West Wing, particularly those who spent years with him, of the thousands of women. Now most of your listeners might find that difficult if not impossible to believe. And I can tell you in the beginning I felt the same way. But let me be clear here. This is a pattern of behavior that has gone on for years. And the abuse of women for years. Asked whether Clinton was having affairs with others in the West Wing, Tripp replied,  I know that to be true. One in particular who I will not name told me this herself. But as to the hundreds or thousands, remember I worked closely with the closest aides to the president. And it was a loosey-goosy environment so there was not a lot of holding back. So it was common knowledge, let s put it this way, within the West Wing that he had this problem. It was further common knowledge that Hillary was aware of it. Tripp described the tense West Wing atmosphere between what she characterized as two almost diametrically opposed Clinton camps.The dynamic between the two groups   the Bill Clinton people and the Hillary Clinton people. It was as though they were almost opposing forces. But I can tell you that the one with the power and the one that instilled the fear in the other was the Hillary camp.And the [Bill] Clinton people would cower if she were coming into the area, just as an example, of the Oval without notice. There would be scurrying around to make sure there was no one in the wrong place at the wrong time, shall we say. It was a fascination to see the amount of energy that was expended covering up his behavior. It was horrifying.Tripp said Hillary personally targeted Bill s female conquests and accusers, with the future presidential candidate exhibiting behavior that is  egregious and it s so disingenuous. In my case, for instance, right after the Lewinsky story broke, she was heard directing her staff to get anything and everything on Linda Tripp. So the defamation of character and the absolute assurance that my credibility would be destroyed began right away. And it happens with any woman who is involved in any way, either with him in a physical relationship or an assault or anything that can endanger their political viability.Tripp recalled Hillary s January 27, 1998 appearance on NBC s The Today Show in which she was seen as standing by her husband while blaming the Lewinsky scandal on a  vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. She didn t do it in an honest way,  said Tripp of Clinton s NBC interview.  Instead she lied, which didn t surprise me. And I will give her credit. She is enormously effective. And became a victim. A wife who was betrayed. This is someone who had no real personal problem with any of this behavior. The problem was in it becoming public. They had to continue to become electable  She was the more aggressive one in ensuring that the political viability was not endangered in any way. Tripp told Klein that Hillary  does not possess integrity on any level. I just wish that your listeners could know the person that I knew. Because if they did there is not a chance she would be elected president. Tripp s ringside seat afforded her rare insight into the scandals of the 1990s and perhaps alleged wrongdoings to come, with the West Wing employee personally witnessing behavior that may have foreshadowed Clinton s email scandal, in which she is accused of sending classified materials through her personal server.Tripp said she noticed major differences in the manner in which classified material was handled by both the Clinton and Bush administrations in which she served.President George H.W. Bush s administration had  a completely different way of operating on every level, including on classified and secret material,  she said.She continued:All the regulations were followed, right down to a cover sheet being essential if the document had had any sort of classifications. The securing of classified documentation in safes. The burn bags that were used if any sensitive material was to be disposed of. All of this was familiar to me and followed every security protocol that I had experienced in the past.When the Clintons came in this was one of the things that I found appalling right from day one. And it went hand and hand with the disdain for the military. The military was present in the White House in the form of presidential aides. The aide that carried the nuclear football, just as an example. And in the Bush White House they were respected, as they should be. In the Clinton White House, they were disdained. To see it treated this way and to see these people treated this way was disturbing.Tripp referred to Clinton s private mail woes as  classic Hillary Clinton in a nutshell. She gets to decide what she does. Look, the rules don t apply to the Clintons. If you understand that basic premise you understand the Clintons. For Tripp, Clinton s use of a private server was  all about control. She has a need to control every single aspect of her life. And you know anyone in government knows that any key stroke on a keyboard within a government agency belongs to the government  it is not up to the employee on any level to control what happens to it for posterity.

#Irma Update: Latest Look as Hurricane Strengthens to Cat 5…’A Great Danger to Florida Keys’,"Hurricane Irma is moving a little west. The Category 5 Hurricane ready to hit Florida is first a great danger to the Florida Keys on SUNDAY. Storm surge is expected to be 10-12 feet. Please pray for the people of Florida.IRMA HITS THE KEYS ON SUNDAY:Meteorologists expect the powerful hurricane to hit the Sunshine State between 5am and 7am ET on Sunday.  Obviously Hurricane Irma continues to be a threat that is going to devastate the United States,  Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said at a press conference Friday morning.  We re going to have a couple rough days. The storm was first downgraded from a Category 5 to a Category 4 earlier on Friday morning, but as of 5pm ET on Friday, it is predicted to hit the U.S. as a Category 5. This will only be the fourth time ever a Category 5 has hit US mainland. As of 6.30pm ET Friday, the hurricane is moving west at 12 mph and located 345 miles southeast of Miami. Government officials along with the National Hurricane Center have cautioned that Irma is  extremely dangerous  with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. That s strong enough to bring down power poles, uproot trees and rip the roofs off of homes. In preparation for what is predicted to be the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in years, an estimated 1.4million people have been given mandatory evacuation orders in both Florida and Georgia.THE TRAFFIC LEAVING FLORIDA IS BUMPER TO BUMPER:A BUSINESS OWNER CUTTING PRICES INSTEAD OF GOUGING:Read more: DM",Government News,"Sep 8, 2017"
" Trump Is FUMING Over Bad Charlottesville Press, Becomes A Terror In The White House (TWEET)","Once again, Donald Trump is having a completely disappointing, inappropriate reaction to the racially motivated violence that happened in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.Apparently, instead of being outraged about the murder of one counter protester and the injuries of several others, Trump is all bent out of shape because he has gotten a lot of negative press coverage for his weak, pathetic response to the incident. According to White House officials, Trump is coming apart at the seams over this, as Robert Costa reported: Person close to Kelly framed it to me this way: POTUS fuming at press, coverage of C ville handling. In no mood for talk about moderation. Seriously, what did Trump expect to happen after he ignored America s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days, before issuing a scripted, half-ass statement on Monday? Not even the white supremacists Trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism.If Trump wanted positive press coverage, he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start. Speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a President could ask for, and Trump failed miserably at executing that. Instead, Trump protected and defended the racist attackers, making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize.Trump can blame the media all he wants, but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president. He never does the right thing, even when it is blatantly obvious what actions he should be taking. What happened in Charlottesville was an opportunity for Trump to emerge as a different president than most Americans expect him to be, and he completely blew it. There is something very wrong when a leader cares more about his press coverage than the lives of his constituents.Featured image via Branden Camp  / Getty Images",News,"August 15, 2017"

 Trump Tweets About His Impeachment Chances In Latest (And Perhaps Greatest) Self-Own,"Nothing betrays your official narrative that your administration is functionally well and you are not a crook like tweeting assurances from Fox News that your chances of being impeached are only slim. One might argue that frantically insisting that you are probably not going to get impeached only makes the notion that you probably are all the more reasonable. No sane president would get caught doing something so desperate.But Trump woke up and did just that.In another humdinger to add to a series of self-owns, Trump retweeted a video of Fox News host Geraldo Rivera insisting that Trump s chances of being impeached went from  3 percent  (a number he pulled out of thin air) to  0 percent  (another number he pulled out of thin air). In doing so, Trump inadvertently acknowledged that his chances of being impeached weren t zero before and are only zero now if you listen to the network that operates as state media for his administration.Trump s self-incrimination is a nice reminder of how troubled his administration is. In an effort to spin the testimony of the former FBI director he recently inappropriately fired, he is reduced to leaning on Fox News to make the case that the hearing didn t prove he was trying to obstruct justice (as most neutral observers noted) but actually it  vindicates  him   somehow. It s a line of spin so patently absurd that even conservative pundits are having a hard time trumpeting it with a straight face.Enter Rivera. The longtime shockjock is, of course, among the least reputable men in journalism. His legendary fails include botching the opening of Al Capone s vault on live television, getting kicked out of Iraq after revealing U.S. troop positions to the enemy on live television, and saying Travyon Martin brought his murder on himself for wearing a hoodie   on live television. Put Rivera in front of a camera, broadcast it live, and chances are he will do something to humiliate himself. He has become one of Trump s biggest defenders.It says something about Trump s chances of making it through his first term without being thrown out of office that he s just a few months in and already he s been reduced to using disreputable Fox hosts like Rivera to defend him. The fact that nobody else will risk destroying their reputation to stand up for him speaks volumes. Luckily, Trump is just dimwitted enough to keep reminding us of his precarious situation because he is fundamentally incapable of not tweeting incredibly stupid things each day.Featured image via Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 12, 2017"
 Kellyanne Lied When She Said She Said She ‘Misspoke’ About Bowling Green Massacre; Here’s Proof,"Among the never ending stream of Trump administration lies, one in particular has captured the attention of Twitter. Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway pretty much lost all her credibility when she claimed, in an interview with Chris Matthews, that there was a Bowling Green massacre which was somehow the fault of President Obama. There wasn t. I bet it s brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Entire twitter feeds sprung up over Conway s made up massacre. Conway s defense was that she misspoke and that the media is just being mean to her..@KellyannePolls:  I misspoke one word. The corrections in the newspapers who are attacking me are 3 paragraphs long every day.  pic.twitter.com/lA0wLk1my8  Fox News (@FoxNews) February 5, 2017Except, this isn t the first time she talked about the Bowling Green massacre and she had even elaborated on it in an interview with, of all sources, Cosmopolitan.(I)n an interview with Cosmopolitan.com conducted by phone days earlier, on Sunday, Jan. 29, Conway used the same phrasing, claiming that President Barack Obama called for a temporary  ban on Iraqi refugees  after the  Bowling Green massacre.  (The quotes did not appear in either of two stories recently published on Cosmopolitan.com.) He did, it s a fact,  she said of Obama.  Why did he do that? He did that for exactly the same reasons. He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers  lives away. In other words, Cosmo did the job that Chris Matthews failed to do.What Conway was referring to is the fact that there were two Iraqi men, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan, who were refugees and did become radicalized (in the United States, not in Iraq), but were arrested before carrying anything out.While Conway tried to tie the massacre that wasn t to Obama s non-existent travel ban, the facts show that Obama handled the situation very well. They administered a toughing vetting process for Iraqi refugees for six months. There was no ban, and as Cosmo has shown, there was no misstatement on Conway s part.Read more:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"February 6, 2017"
 SNL Hilariously Mocks One Of Trump’s Biggest Supporters During Opening (VIDEO),"Saturday Night Live hilariously skewered Donald Trump s misogyny and the women who love his campaign during the sketch show s cold open.The sketch begins with Kate Bolduan, played by Kate McKinnon saying: Welcome back to At This Hour. I m Kate Bolduan.  I ve got the brain for MSNBC, the hair for Fox News. So here I am at CNN. Bolduan then introduces Tea Party News Network host and fervent Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes. During a recent appearance on CNN, the real life Hughes defended comments Trump had made where he said that he would punish women who sought abortions.

As a woman I like Donald Trump, but as a full-blown nutjob, I friggin  love him! Bolduan then questions Hughes defense of Trump s sexism, asking her why she would support someone who tweeted out an obviously sexist picture of Ted Cruz s wife.SNL mocks the sheer length that Hughes will go to in order to defend Trump at any costs and Trump s hand size by having Hughes reply: Actually, that was an accident. Okay cuz  Donald s hands are just so big he can t see what every little tweet his fingers retweet. After confirming that Hughes is  seriously  using that answer, she presses the Trump super fan on the matter of Trump s comments regarding abortion. Hughes then pulls out the first answer she can think fo saying: What that is, was just Donald making an April Fool s joke, cus  it was April Fool s.

UNHINGED TEXAS WOMAN DRIVING Pickup Truck With Vile Anti-Trump Message Gets Arrested For Unrelated Offense,"Just another case of  Love Trumps Hate LOL! The more hate these unhinged liberals spew, the more Independent voters will be inspired to go to the polls and vote for Trump in 2020.The owner of a pickup truck that drew attention this week because of a profane anti-Trump sticker was arrested in Houston on Thursday on an outstanding warrant.Karen Fonseca was arrested about 2 p.m. on an outstanding fraud warrant issued in August by the Rosenberg, Texas, Police Department, Fort Bend County Sheriff s Office records show.Mike Fonseca, her husband, posted her $1,500 bond Thursday night and she was released an hour later, Houston s KHOU-TV reported.A sheriff s spokesman didn t respond to a message seeking details about the warrant.Previously, Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls threatened Fonseca with a disorderly conduct charge over the decal. However, District Attorney John Healey said he didn t think the case would have stood up in court because of First Amendment protections on free speech.Fonseca defended her right to keep the sticker on the vehicle. It s not to cause hate or animosity,  Fonseca, 46, told the Houston Chronicle.  It s just our freedom of speech and we re exercising it. Fonseca said the message has been on the rear window of the pickup for nearly a year and it ll stay there for the time being. There s no law against freedom of speech, nothing in the law book here in Texas,  she told KHOU-TV.  I ve been stopped numerous times, but they can t write me a ticket. Nehls on Wednesday posted a photo of the profane sticker on his Facebook page, threatening the then-unidentified Fonseca with a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct.A spokeswoman for the sheriff s office said Thursday that Nehls removed the post after Fonseca was identified. Due to the hate messages he has been receiving toward his wife and children, the sheriff will not be commenting on the matter further,  the spokeswoman said in an email.

 Newsweek Just Made Their BEST Cover Ever And People Are Freaking Out,"Newsweek has never been a publication to shy away from controversy, but the upcoming issue that hits newsstands on November 10 will take things to a whole new level. Not only does the cover raise the question of the current Trump administration being the most corrupt in US history, it also features the following image flanked by the headline  Snakes on a Plane,  referencing the 2006 film starring Samuel L. Jackson:New cover story: Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in U.S. history, one of first-class kleptocrats https://t.co/3KUQGPiOFR pic.twitter.com/wKvs93XsJ0  Newsweek (@Newsweek) November 2, 2017For those of you who need a little help making out the image, that is President Trump straddling a jet named the  Government Air  while throwing fistfuls of cash skyward with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sitting behind him tossing a few dollars more. Mnuchin s wife, Scottish actress Louise Linton, is next in line, just holding on for dear life, with Education Secretary Nancy DeVos at the end throwing some money into the air as well. Former HHS Secretary Tom Price can also be seen plummeting to earth, an obvious reference to the ex-congressman s unexpected departure from the Trump administration. The inclusion of Mnuchin, Linton, and Price is also most likely in reference to the scandals they ve faced in regards to taxpayer-funded air travel.Things only get worse for Trump and his cabinet once the reader opens the issue. In a cover story written by Alexander Nazaryan titled  Trump is Leading the Most Corrupt Administration in U.S. History, One of First-Class Kleptocrats,  Trump s cabinet is exposed for their use of taxpayer money for lavish and completely unnecessary expenses such as vacations and extra security detail. Ironic, considering Trump s campaign promise was to  drain the swamp,  vowing to cleanse the government of corruption. [Trump s Cabinet] were people, we d been told, who were sacrificing lucrative private-sector posts to work in the service of the American people,  Nazaryan writes in the article.  Now, those very same  forgotten Americans were paying for [Secretary of the Treasury Steven] Mnuchin, worth as much as $500 million, because he apparently didn t want to go through airport security.

 WATCH: MSNBC Host HILARIOUSLY Informs Republican Men Why They Should Pay For Prenatal Care,"Republicans seriously need to pay attention in biology class.Because if they had, they would know that the reason women get pregnant in the first place is because of men.And that s why women need prenatal care to be covered by health insurance plans.But Republicans like Rep. John Shimkus think that men should not have to pay for prenatal care in their insurance plans, even though by doing exactly that they are protecting pregnant women and the fetuses they carry.During a committee hearing on Thursday, Shimkus openly whined about men having to pay for prenatal care and argued that insurance companies should only make women pay for it.Economist Austin Goolsbee expressed confusion over Shimkus  objection and proceeded to explain to him how insurance works. If you look at any insurance product, everyone pays in because there s a risk that a small number of people are going to have a claim,  Goolsbee began.  So, there s a subsidy, if you want to call it that, from people who don t get in car accidents to people who do get in car accidents. That s the nature of insurance. Everyone is born, I think we can agree on that. The prenatal care is good for society, that we are covering prenatal care, that women can have babies in a healthy way, and to object that men shouldn t have to pay for things that are women s problems, young people shouldn t pay in for things that are old people s problems. Hopefully all the young people will be old people, eventually. As I say, that s how insurance markets work. I don t understand this objection. Indeed, that s how Social Security works. Each generation of workers basically subsidizes the retirement of workers who came before them. This way, senior citizens can retire and live comfortably while a younger person gets a job.Republicans can also look at prenatal care another way. If they are seriously going to force women to carry pregnancies to term, the least they can do is help make sure that the mother and fetus are healthy and getting the medical attention they need.The cost of prenatal care insurance would skyrocket if women were the only ones having to pay for it since the insurance pool would be smaller.MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle, who has three children, also chimed in by informing Republicans that women don t impregnate themselves. Congressman Shimkus, if you are watching, unlike Tom Price, I m not a doctor. But I will talk science for a moment. Though it is women who need that prenatal care, men are involved in the process that requires them to need prenatal care, FYI. Here s the video via YouTube:Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for complaining so much about women s healthcare. Their mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives must be embarrassed.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 10, 2017"

WOW! 3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel…One Has Criminal Background…May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO],"3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! I hear what you re saying, I mean, these intelligence committees handle our terror strategies right? They got in on Benghazi by the way.Yes, and they also worked for many Democrats in the House. They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails.

Plastic Persona: Behind the Scenes of the Ted Cruz Media Machine,"21st Century Wire says Most people accept that a certain amount of political campaigning is staged, and even a little contrived at times.For the most part, the public is fairly unaware of just how fabricated the political images they see on TV really are.Earlier, 21WIRE showed the abysmal scene from GOP candidate Jeb Bush s recent staged town hall meeting. As bad as that Jeb moment was, it almost pales in comparison to what s on offer here After their narrow Iowa GOP caucus victory this week, the Cruz campaign took a cheeky swipe at rival Donald Trump. Cruz communications director Rick Tyler remarked to CNN after the final results were announced,  Reality hit the realty TV star in Iowa, so nobody is talking about him now, so he s trying to regain some attention on Twitter.

Ron Paul Liberty Report: US-Saudi Arms Trafficking to Terrorists in Syria,"Back in July, 21WIRE detailed the investigative work of Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, and her report which exposed a US and Saudi Arabia-sponsored international weapons trafficking operation   where arms purchased through third parties and ferried on diplomatic flights using Azerbaijan state-run airlines, Silkway Airlines. The illegal program was launched under President Barack Obama in 2012 and continues to this day under Donald Trump. Despite bountiful evidence, the western mainstream media has simply ignored and steered away from this story. Liberty Report asks:  Why is the Pentagon spending billions of dollars purchasing Soviet and east European weapons to ship to Syrian rebels? A blockbuster Bulgarian investigative report exposes the lies and illegality of the purchases and shipments; several mainstream investigations corroborate the Bulgarian report.

THE REAL REASON JOE BIDEN HASN’T ANNOUNCED HE’S RUNNING YET: Reliable Investigative Reporter Shares The Disturbing Inside Scoop,"Obama couldn t just endorse Joe Biden because like a loyal dog, he s defended every one of his unconstitutional acts against America. No Obama doesn t do anything without injecting Chicago style politics into the equation. In this case, he will only endorse one of the dumbest men in Washington DC for our next President if he agrees to his radical terms.How very  Putin-esque The talk in Democratic Party circles is that Barack Obama has told Joe Biden that he is prepared to endorse him for president if, in return, Biden promises to let Obama have a final say in the choice of his vice presidential running mate.According to these Democratic sources, Biden is mulling over the president s conditional offer of support.In addition, there is speculation among top Democratic sources that Obama has another quid pro quo for his endorsement: he wants Biden to choose an African American as his vice presidential running mate.In this scenario, which Obama has not yet fully explained to Biden, Biden would promise to serve only one term in the White House, after which he would back his vice president to succeed him.As Biden s vice president, Obama is said to favor former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a close Obama ally who is the first and only African American to have served as governor of the Bay State.Obama has already given Biden carte blanche to use Air Force Two, the official vice presidential plane, to crisscross the country and launch an unofficial campaign.So far, Biden has visited several key primary and general election states and hammered GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, charging that Trump is offering a  sick message  on immigration.Biden has also courted the Jewish vote, hinting that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.With Obama s blessing, Biden appeared on  The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,  where he discussed his son Beau s death from brain cancer and came across as an authentic alternative to the stiff and overly scripted Hillary Clinton.

LAWLESS: OBAMA WON’T TAKE EXECUTIVE AMNESTY TO SUPREME COURT,"Why should Barack Obama bother with the courts? He s always been above the law. He s already proven to us that he doesn t need a court ruling to bring millions of illegal aliens into our country. He s not following any laws when he demands our border patrol agents stand down to drug cartels, dangerous gangs, pedophiles, members of terror groups and rapists crossing our open borders. He doesn t need a law to ensure that in exchange for votes for the Democrat party, American taxpayers will reward illegal aliens with the right to free education, free food, free health care and subsidized housing. Who needs the law when you re  America s First Black President. The Obama administration revealed today that it will not take the fight over executive immigration amnesty to the Supreme Court, essentially admitting defeat in its fight to lift a court-ordered stay placed by a Texas judge.Obama s executive actions still have to be settled in court, but yesterday s decision prevented the administration from moving forward in its efforts to sign up illegal immigrants for the amnesty programs. The department believes the best way to achieve this goal is to focus on the ongoing appeal on the merits of the preliminary injunction itself,  said Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the Justice Department to the New York Times.  Although the department continues to disagree with the Fifth Circuit s refusal to stay the district court s preliminary injunction, the department has determined that it will not seek a stay from the Supreme Court. The arguments for the legal battle begin next month before the Fifth Circuit court, but the results of yesterday s decision mean the final will likely be pushed into 2016. There s an important hearing scheduled for July 6 at which the Department of Justice is preparing its arguments on the legal merits of the executive actions that the president announced last fall,  White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters aboard Air Force One.  The Department of Justice remains focused on that argument and that hearing proceeding on an expedited basis.

HOLY CASH COW! Check Out How Much Wall Street Funneled Into HILLARY’s Foundation/Slush Fund,"Thank God she has a vagina, otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voters Hillary Clinton is facing more questions about her close ties to Wall Street financial institutions. Last week, the New York Times urged Clinton to release transcripts of her highly-compensated speeches to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs.The paid speeches are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titans. According to Clinton Foundation records, Wall Street financial institutions have donated around $40 million to the eponymous family foundation.As a non-profit, the Clinton Foundation isn t legally required to disclose its donors or contributions. The Foundation has publicly disclosed some contributions on its website. It only provides ranges for contributions, e.g. $1-5 million, and doesn t detail when the contribution was made or for what purpose, if any.Here s the chart of contributions from Wall Street to the Clinton Foundation.All together, contributions from readily identifiable Wall Street institutions to the Foundation total somewhere between $11 million and $41 million in contributions. If we assume the donations fall in the middle of the ranges disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, the contributions would total just under $30 million.As with most things involving the Clintons, the devil is in the details. This total of contributions does not include those made by individuals with strong Wall Street ties. It also does not necessarily represent the total amounts contributed to the Foundation from those donors listed. It only accounts for the donations which the Foundation has chosen to disclose.The failure of the Foundation to include any information on the timing of the donations is especially worrisome. In terms of donor relationships, there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $1 million and an ongoing gift of $200,000 for 5 straight years. The total dollar amount may be the same, but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the Foundation and the donor.There is, of course, an added dimension to the timing issue with the Clintons. During the life of the Foundation, Hillary Clinton has been a US Senator, Secretary of State and two-time candidate for President.When the Clinton Foundation discloses that the  Friends of Saudi Arabia  contributed $1-5 million, it begs the obvious question of when that donation was made. The specific date of that donation is particularly important, given Clinton s considerable focus on the Middle East while she was Secretary of State.It is also important to note that these contributions are completely seperate from the paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2013 alone, Hillary earned just over $3 million in paid speeches to financial firms and institutions.These contributions, obviously, also don t include direct contributions made by Wall Street institutions and individuals to either of Clinton s Presidential campaigns.For entire story: Breitbart News",left-news,"Mar 1, 2016"
 Racist Joe Arpaio Extorts Money For Re-Election By Threatening To Retire (SCREENSHOTS),"Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a vile creature. The 83-year-old has reigned over the Arizona county for more than twenty years, much to the dismay of the Hispanic community, and he s running for office again. But, the way he is soliciting donations from his scared, xenophobic supporters this time around is absolutely infuriating.In an email sent out to supporters recently, America s Most Racist Sheriff extorts money from his ignorant voters by threatening to retire. The email s subject line is: Announcement: I ve made a difficult decision  and begins by calling on his  patriots  to support him or else: After hours of prayer, and countless frank discussions with my wife Ava and other trusted advisors, I have decided my time as Sheriff is over, unless I can count on you to stand with me this election. Arpaio then goes on to blame  left-wing elites,  his immigration stance,  Obama s political machine,  and  Hollywood leftists  for the tough road he has ahead of him should he decide to run for re-election. He tells his supporters that they need to empty their wallets and help him defeat the scary liberals who want to see him out of office: For some of you $5 is all you can spare today. But for others $500 or even $1,000 is a sacrificial gift you are willing to make. My team has told me that because our reserves are almost completely drained I will need to raise at least 5 million dollars to have a fighting chance, so every single dollar helps. To be clear, this is absolutely, 100 percent extortion. The definition of which is  the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats. He is threatening that he will retire and not bother to run again unless his faithful, immigrant-hating supporters shell out money for him. He doesn t just tell them he d like to be their sheriff again, he threatens them. And this isn t the first time he has duped voters.In 2015, he sent an email out with a similarly deceiving subject line: They re trying to recall me.  Nobody was trying to recall him at the time. I mean, we always want to recall him but there wasn t a concerted effort to remove him from office.It s not surprising that he would stoop to such levels. This is, after all, the man who can be blamed for countless deaths in his jail and has made the lives of Latinos in his community a living hell. He was Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump. His bombastic, hate-filled rhetoric garnered him the support of many top Republicans   including former-Governor Jan Brewer.Since 1993, he has unleashed hell on brown-skinned people in his Phoenix. And sadly, every time he is up for re-election he wins because people just don t vote or they have become complacent. For whatever reason, he continues to sail to victory each time he runs.Hopefully, Maricopa County voters will be so turned off this newest extoruion plot and they ll vote for someone else   but, I won t hold my breath.See the full email below:   And here s a video to remember why we hate this guy so much: Featured image via Facebook",News,"January 20, 2016"
UNREAL! FORMER GITMO DETAINEES PROTEST AT U.S. EMBASSY FOR FREEBIES FROM THE U.S.,"We should do NOTHING for these terrorists! They got money and a house from the government of Uruguay but want even more from the U.S. and Uruguay. Unreal!Four former Guantanamo Bay prisoners protested for a second day Saturday demanding more help from both the Uruguayan and the U.S. governments for adapting to life in their new home in this South American country.The men began their protest in front of the U.S. Embassy in Montevideo on Friday and said they slept there through the night. They insisted would stay until they met with the U.S. ambassador. We ll be here until Monday. We are not leaving until with speak with the ambassador,  former detainee Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi said.The men began their protest after the embassy closed for the weekend, and U.S. officials had not responded to messages requesting comment.As a humanitarian gesture, Uruguay s government took in the four and two other men in December after U.S. authorities freed them from Guantanamo. They had spent 12 years at the U.S. military prison for suspected al-Qaida ties, but U.S. officials decided they were no longer a threat and let them go.The four Syrians, one Tunisian and one Palestinian have repeatedly said the United States should help them financially so they can afford to bring their families to Uruguay.The men get $600 (15,000 pesos) a month from Uruguay s government, which they must use to pay for food, clothes, cellphones and other personal items.

"ELECTION FRAUD: If It Happened in Michigan, Will It Happen in Ohio?","21st Century Wire says On a recent episode of The Sunday Wire with Patrick Henningsen, guest Basil Valentine asked Patrick for his analysis on the Bernie Sanders vs. Hillary Clinton primary race, and what ensued was a poignant discussion about a deeper issue   voter and election fraud.PH: It s a tight race. Hillary has the edge on the super delegates, which is the most corrupt, un-democratic aspect of the Democratic Party. BV: I m not sure it s it s very un-democratic and corrupt, I agree. But I don t think it s the most corrupt. The most corrupt is the vote fraud. Basil cites a new report about the recent Michigan Presidential Primary, where its findings suggest that Bernie Sanders actually did better than the recorded vote share indicates.The author of the report, Richard Charnin, provides context not only for Michigan primary results but for Massachusetts results as well:This analysis indicates that Sanders did much better than his recorded vote in the Michigan primary. Sanders had 590,386 votes (49.8%) and Clinton 570,948 (48.3%). Sanders won in 73 of 83 MI counties with 56% of the vote. He won the preliminary exit poll by 52.1-45.9%, a 97% win probability. Clinton won urban counties Wayne and Oakland with approximately 55% of the vote.Clinton won the Massachusetts primary by just 1.4%, but she did well in urban areas. Sanders won hand-counted precincts by 57-40% in 68 Towns (32,360 votes, 2.7% of votes cast). Sanders also had 52.1% in the preliminary exit poll which he won by 52.1-45.7%. His win probability was also 97%.(See Charnin s full report and statistical analysis here, including a breakdown of voting machine totals.)Charnin explains there are three key indicators to track in determining whether election fraud has occurred:  cumulative vote shares, preliminary exit poll, absentee vote anomalies Of course, you will not hear much about election fraud from the media   their coverage focuses solely on the recorded vote at the end of the night, and the usual Poli-tricks and Propaganda  mess with voters  minds during their televised election coverage.Will we see these same election fraud indicators in the Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina primaries?READ MORE 2016 NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",US_News,"March 15, 2016"
 Trump’s Response When Told He Should Stop Tweeting Makes Him Sound Like A Whiny Toddler,"Donald Trump s tweeting is a source of endless nightmares for Republicans and White House staff. They can try to sugarcoat anything Trump does, but it s hard to put a positive spin on the ramblings of a clearly troubled man. A typical Trump tweet shot off in the early morning may, say, contradict an official statement. Or prove a White House talking point is a lie. Or contain basic grammar and spelling mistakes. And some have even been used in court to rule against the White House s attempted Muslim ban.Adding to that, Trump s tweets are a visual, daily reminder that our president is, at his heart, a complete moron. Take this classic two-piece of idiocy, for example:First Trump proudly announces he plans on creating a cyber team with the country that hacked America s last presidential election.Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017Hours later, he screams that it isn t happening after Americans of all political stripes pointed out how stupid the idea was.The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017His staff has privately told reporters that they spend a great deal of their time at the White House trying to find ways to get Trump to stop binge-watching Fox News and tweeting about whatever comes up on his favorite show, Fox and Friends. The struggle has, at times, descended into sheer lunacy.  During one of Trump s latest Twitter meltdowns, a despondent aide sent a reporter a simple message:Informed of the president s denial that he had recorded his conversations with Comey, a senior administration official replied,  At least that s behind us.  When alerted to his apparent suspicions of Oval Office surveillance, the official replied in a text message,  fml. What does Trump think about these attempts to save him from himself? It makes him angry.New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich filed a lengthy piece with a simple premise: The White House is a total-and-unending shitshow and Trump is at the epicenter. Leibovich was, in fact, in the room, when the idea of Trump s Twitter self-sabotage was brought up to the president. Trump s reaction speaks volumes.It was 12:30, but the president was not eating lunch. He was watching a recording of  Fox and Friends  from about four hours earlier on a large TV mounted on the wall. This was one of those stretches when Trump was tweeting a lot, including attacks on the mayor of London following a terrorist attack on the city the previous weekend. The tweets were becoming a growing topic of concern among Republicans, many of whom were urging him to stop. But like most reporters, I found his tweets far more illuminating than anything the White House press office could ever disgorge. I urged him to keep it up.Trump assured me that he would keep tweeting.  It s my voice,  Trump said of Twitter, enumerating how many millions of followers he had.  They want to take away my voice,  Trump said.  They re not going to take away my social media. In just two paragraphs, Leibovich documented Trump s insane Fox News viewing habits, the well-known patent dishonesty of the White House press office, and Trump s own spoiled brat way of looking at his Twitter habits. It takes Stephen King an entire novel to write anything half as scary as that snapshot of the man who currently controls America s nuclear arsenal.Featured image via Matt Cardy/Getty Images",News,"July 11, 2017"
 ‘F*cking Grow Up’: The Internet Destroys Trump After He Says He Would Have Won Against Obama,"President Obama pretty much trolled Donald Trump earlier by saying that he could have defeated the alleged billionaire and former reality show star. Obama spoke of his hope and change campaign and confirmed what we all know already.  His insight was that we just have to say  no  to that then that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about  hope and change  and no red state and blue state is   is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy,  the President said.  And if we can   if we can puncture that vision, then we have a chance to win back seats in the House and win back seats in the Senate. If I had run again and articulated it, I think I could ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,  he continued. In the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have suggested that somehow, [my vision] really was a fantasy,  he continued.  What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism. Well, that nugget of information was too much for the thin-skinned president-elect to handle so after not tweeting for 24 hours, he unleashed a nonsensical tweet in response to Obama s interview. President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY!   jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc,  Trump tweeted with his tiny hands.President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me.

"WATCH SEAN SPICER Slam Hillary With Great Sports Analogy On Election Loss: “Look, I’m a Patriots fan…” [Video]","Sean Spicer gave Hillary Clinton a little dig when he used the analogy of the Falcons vs Patriots game to explain the election last year. You ll love this! It s in response to Clinton s ridiculous claim that the press and Comey were to blame for her loss (see below). She needs to just go away! It s somewhat sad that we re still debating that the president won in the fashion he did Amen to that!The Media Research Center recently published a study showing that 91% of the coverage Donald Trump received during his campaign was considered negative or  hostile .Was it even necessary to prove that almost all of candidate Trump s media coverage was negative or  hostile  compared to Hillary Clinton s?  For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted. ",politics,"May 3, 2017"

BREAKING: GUN USED BY 5 TIME DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIEN BELONGED TO FEDERAL AGENT,"Just another interesting discovery in a story that has already exposed a very corrupt government that favors illegal aliens over American citizens The gun used in the seemingly random slaying of a woman on a San Francisco pier belonged to a federal agent, a law enforcement official briefed on the matter said Tuesday.The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity, said a police check of the weapon s serial number shows it belonged to a federal agent. The official declined to elaborate further.The San Francisco Police Department, which is investigating the case, declined to comment.The revelation was the latest dramatic twist in a tragic case that has become a new flashpoint in the country s debate over immigration policies.The suspected gunman, Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, has been deported to his native Mexico five times and is suspected of living in the United States illegally when Kathryn Steinle, 32, was gunned down last week while on an evening stroll with her father along San Francisco s popular waterfront area.Federal officials transferred Sanchez to San Francisco s jail in March to face a 20-year-old marijuana charge after Sanchez completed his latest prison term for illegally entering the country.The San Francisco sheriff, citing the city s  sanctuary city  policy, released Sanchez in April after prosecutors dropped the drug charge, despite an Immigration and Customs Enforcement request to hold him for federal authorities so deportation proceedings could begin.Sanchez pleaded not guilty Tuesday to first-degree murder.He told two television stations who interviewed him in jail that he found the gun used in Steinle s killing wrapped in a shirt on the pedestrian pier she was walking on. Sanchez said the gun went off in his hands, and his public defender, Matt Gonzalez, said Tuesday that the San Francisco woman s death appeared accidental. San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi has defended Sanchez s release and the city law requiring it to ignore ICE detainer requests. The sheriff said ICE could have obtained a warrant or court order to keep Sanchez in custody. ICE knew where he was,  Mirkarimi said Monday. He said he will continue to ignore ICE detainer requests.State and federal Republicans, meanwhile, said they would look into the matter.Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who chairs the Senate s homeland security committee, criticized federal officials and demanded to know why Sanchez was not deported. Does that make any sense to you?  Johnson demanded to know at a hearing Tuesday.  Because I ll tell you it doesn t make any sense to the American public. Republican state Sen. Jeff Stone said he would introduce legislation in Sacramento to require cities to comply with ICE detainer requests.At Sanchez s arraignment Tuesday, prosecutor Dianna Garcia argued against releasing Sanchez on bail, saying,  This was an act of random violence, shooting an innocent victim in the back. The judge set bail at $5 million, which Gonzalez said will keep Sanchez jailed pending trial.A downcast Sanchez spent most of the hearing with his head bowed, appearing to fight back tears while the judge explained the charged to him. Sanchez was aided by a Spanish-language interpreter and entered his plea in Spanish.Outside court, his attorney said Sanchez has a second-grade education and a non-violent criminal record.He could face life in prison if convicted.Via: FOX Carolina",left-news,"Jul 8, 2015"
"THIS MAY BE THE CLINTON’S Most DEPLORABLE Act Ever: “The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives?'”","Scum of the earth isn t strong enough for these grifters. The Clinton Family must be the most disgusting, self-serving people to ever run a  charitable  organization. So many former Presidents have done such amazing work for people around the world who have faced poverty, sickness and natural disasters. With the billions of dollars the Clinton s received from donors around the world (well, primarily in Hollywood and Saudi Arabi) just think of all of the good they could have done if the Clinton s weren t such selfish, power-hungry human beings Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed  watered-down  HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and  likely increased  the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.The congressional report, titled, The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,  was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.The congressional report focused on Clinton s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.  This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,  said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,  said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement,  alleged due to the company s diluted drugs, it  subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,  according to the report. The question becomes,  how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,  asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s campaign.Blackburn said she planned to deliver the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama s first term.The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the  watered-down  drugs.ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered  more than $1.8 million packages. Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,  Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients. These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,  he said.Ranbaxy s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.The FDA sent a public  warning letter  to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications,  show much lower potencies in these batches. Although Ranbaxy s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.For entire story: The Daily Caller ",politics,"Sep 20, 2016"
 Lightning Struck Trump Tower As Polls Closed On Super Tuesday (VIDEO),"As the polls closed for the Republican primary on Super Tuesday, Illinois experienced a phenomenon that could only have been captured by being in the right place at the right time: the moment lightning struck the Trump tower in downtown Chicago.Instagram user @mrmikeyv posted a video of this coincidental, once-in-a-lifetime event, captioning the clip perfectly by writing,  Lightning storm ironically hitting the Trump building on #supertuesday.  Polls were closing just as this force of nature occurred, revealing that the business mogul had taken Illinois as a win, as well as Florida and North Carolina. Clearly, mother nature wasn t happy about that.Lightning storm ironically hitting the Trump building on #supertuesday @mb2davis @thepassportreport @insta_chicagoA video posted by @mrmikeyv on Mar 15, 2016 at 9:29pm PDTThis ironically-timed, strange message from mother nature was a result of a major storm in northern Illinois, which resulted in approximately six tornadoes that damaged several houses and a church. The Super Tuesday polls revealed that Trump got 38.8 percent of the vote in Illinois, along with 49 delegates from the state.Despite running a campaign based on bigotry, violence and some of the most extreme rhetoric a presidential campaign has ever seen, Trump has been unstoppable   even though he hasn t proposed one solid solution that will actually  make America great again.  Trump has risen above negative reports about lawsuits from his failed businesses, his awful misogynistic track record with women, support from white supremacists, and constant flip-flopping and lies. Still, he s continued on to defeat every single one of the GOP s incapable-yet-better-than-Trump candidates aside from Ted Cruz and John Kasich, although they probably don t stand a chance against the front runner. America is getting desperate for ways to end this Trump nightmare once and for all.Perhaps it was divine intervention that caused the sky to open up and rain down on Illinois as Trump won yet another state, striking one of the candidate s precious towers in disappointment. Unfortunately, the Trump Tower still stands and was barely phased by it. Trump is also still standing, running for the GOP nomination, and winning.

 The Backstreet Boys Send Harsh Message To Trump For His Use Of Their Song (DETAILS),"If you ve at all been watching the news coverage of Donald Trump rallies lately, you ve likely noticed the use of an upbeat pop song from the late 1990s. For some reason or another, the Trump campaign is using the Backstreet Boys  I Want It That Way. Well, guess what? Just like with pretty much every other artist that has asked Trump to stop using their music, so are the Backstreet Boys. They don t want to be associated, whatsoever, with his campaign.According to Steven Trachtenbroit, a publicist for the group: [The Backstreet Boys] did not approve this and we are not associated with the Trump camp. That statement was issued on October 12th. Yet, the Trump campaign can still be heard playing that song at rallies. It s become pretty obvious that Trump has no respect for the music he s using nor the artists who created it. This pretty much keeps in line with his inability to honor contracts and respect, well, anyone.When music is used, it gives the implication that the artist and musicians that created the music approve of the message being delivered by any particular candidate.You ll often hear Hillary Clinton use Katy Perry or Sara Bareilles, but they have both openly come out in support of Hillary, and clearly don t have a problem with the former Secretary of State utilizing their songs.Unfortunately for Trump, he s pretty much left with the music of Kid Rock and Ted Nugent if he wants to find music to play at his rallies.It comes down to asking permission and/or when asked to stop using music, to actually stop using the music. Trump is so quick to sue, but doesn t seem to think the same rules apply to him. This is yet another reason he needs to be kept as far away from the White House as possible.Featured Photo by Ethan Miller, Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 26, 2016"

DC WAITRESS Who Admits To Being Prejudiced…Gets Big Surprise From White Trump Supporters After She Participated In Women’s March,"Slowly but surely our nation will heal. It will take some time, and there will those who resist, but America is stronger than the hate of a small group of radicals who under Barack Obama s direction, have worked  to intentionally divide us.A waitress at a Washington D.C. restaurant received a very generous tip and a warm message on her receipt from three men who were in town for President Donald Trump s inauguration.Rosalynd Harris, who works at Busboys and Poets in the northwest part of the nation s capital, told The Washington Post she was beaming with confidence Monday after taking part in the Women s March over the weekend.A group of men from west Texas entered the restaurant and started to chat with Harris. One of the men, who said he was a dentist, complimented her on her smile. Harris, who is black, told the Post she was admittedly a bit prejudice when the men, who were white, told her they were in town to support Trump.However, Harris didn t expect what would come next.After the men had left, Harris picked up their check and found that they left a heartwarming message and a generous tip. They left Harris a $450 tip on a $72.60 bill. Their message read:We rise by lifting others.

MUST WATCH: SEN TED CRUZ Tells SEN BERNIE SANDERS To “Curb Your Enthusiasm” In Hilarious Moment During CNN Debate,"Two US Senators who couldn t be more ideologically opposed, Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Independent (Socialist Party) Senator Bernie Sanders came together for what ended up being a very entertaining debate on the subject of the GOP tax plan during a debate hosted by CNN.The polarizing topic has been at the center of Capitol Hill, as lawmakers have attempted to reform the tax code. Republicans, in an effort to pass the tax code, have explored trying to pass tax reform without Democratic support; while Democrats have complained that they have been left out of a crucial, bipartisan process in governing.Included in the GOP tax plan is a 20% corporate tax rate, the elimination of the estate tax, and the implementation of three tax brackets.Cruz defended the plan, saying on CNN,  Republicans want to lower the taxes for each and every person watching this debate,  and said that lowering the corporate tax rate would allow businesses to create more jobs.Sanders, however, said the GOP s tax plan is about giving  tax breaks to people who don t need it.  The senator said he supports  a tax cut for the middle class and working families. Throughout the evening, the two senators threw several verbal jabs at each other s expense.At one point, Cruz claimed that his 2016 presidential campaign tried to strengthen social security and said politicians in Washington were  recklessly letting it careen towards insolvency. There are no changes at all,  Cruz said.  Every dollar, every penny of benefit is protected, but for young people, people my age  You re not so young anymore,  Sanders replied. You d be surprised,  Cruz said.Cruz also joked about the impersonation that comedian Larry David, star of HBO s  Curb Your Enthusiasm  did of Sanders on an episode of  Saturday Night Live. I m not interrupting you,  Sanders said, waving his hand as a sign for Cruz to hurry.  Come on, come on. You know, as some might say, curb your enthusiasm,  Cruz quipped.  By the way, the impression that Larry David does of you is spectacular and uncanny.

Pray for the families and friends of the victims. Pray for America America is reeling from the worst mass shooting in its history after at least 50 people were killed and more than 200 wounded at a country music festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.Police say the shooter was 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, described as a local man, who opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas Village from a room across the street in the Mandalay Bay Hotel shortly after 10pm.Officers say Paddock killed himself right before they breached a room in the hotel, where he had stashed an  arsenal  of weapons used during the massacre.Paddock s companion and roommate, Marilou Danley was apprehended early Monday morning. Investigators are now raiding the Mesquite home he shared with Marilou Danley, described as his  companion .Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said investigations are still ongoing and police have not yet determined a motive.President Donald Trump paid his respects on Monday morning after the shooting, writing on Twitter:  My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting.

" Florida Republican To Black Voters: ‘If You Don’t Like It Here, Go Back To Africa’","Paul Congemi, a Republican candidate running for mayor of St. Petersburg, Florida, sent a clear message to black voters at a forum on Tuesday when he told mayoral opponent Jesse Nevel and members of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement to  Go back to Africa. Congemi claims to have been a life-long Democrat who switched to Republican after former President Barack Obama showed his support for gay marriage. Nevel, on the other hand, is white and has been running his campaign on the slogan  Unity through reparations,  and has also spoken out against gentrification and police brutality.Then there is the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, a socialist organization of white people who believe that the key to ending racial inequality is through reparations, but Congemi sees things from different angle. Mr. Nevel you and your people talk about reparations. The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama,  Congemi said at Tuesday s forum.  My advice to you, if you don t like it here in America, planes leave every hour from Tampa airport. Go back to Africa. Go back to Africa. Go back,  he continued, repeatedly pointing at the crowd and later making motions to exit.His statement was met with a combination of shock and disgust, with one woman in the crowd shouting  Get out of here!  after Congemi s comment about Barack Obama.Rick Kriseman, the sitting mayor of St. Petersburg, was also critical of the candidate s words, claiming on Wednesday that Congemi s statement was hateful, bigoted, and unacceptable toward black and gay Floridians. Jesse Nevel also saw the move as tactless, saying that Congemi s comment reflects a segment of my community. I ve met plenty of other people who feel that way. That s why I feel that it s important for those of us in the white community to take a public stand with reparations. In typical Republican fashion, Congemi tried to weasel his way out of the firestorm he had created, telling the Washington Post that he has  nothing against African Americans who are doing their best here in America,  and that his remarks were only aimed at those who are pushing for reparations. He even referred to Nevel as a  self-hating white man. The controversy doesn t seem to have slowed Congemi down, and he claims that anyone who believes he is racist simply misunderstood his comments. Even if he loses this time, he s not going to stop. I ll run again in 2019 and, God willing, if I m alive in 2021, I ll run then, too,  Congemi said.  I intend to keep running and running and running. Featured image via video screen capture from YouTube",News,"July 21, 2017"

OBAMA’S EMBARRASSING Farewell Interview: Mom Was “Hippie” But Shaved Her Legs…Promises To Take 5-Star Mooch On “Nice Vacation…She Deserves It”,"We all know the rules are a little different for the political class. But Michelle Obama s trips overseas hardly qualify as official business. They are lavish, extravagant, and excessive by any reasonable metric. Moreover, these latest revelations are hardly isolated.They are part of continuum reaching back across to the earliest days of the Obama administration. Recently, Judicial Watch obtained flight expense records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force revealing that Michelle Obama s June 2015 trip to the United Kingdom and Italy, accompanied by her daughters and mother, cost the taxpayers $240,495.67 in flight expenses alone.The records were released in response to a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request filed on June 22, 2015. The flights to London, England; and Milan, Venice, and Vicenza, Italy, for the June 15   21, 2015, trip totaled 20:35 hours at the cost of $11,684 per hour, bringing the flight expense total to $240,495.67, according to the Air Force documents.The Obama White House, true to form, tried spin the trip as a public service that was part of Michelle Obama s campaign to push her  Let Girls Learn  initiative and  Let s Move  anti-obesity campaign.Good grief. Everyone should deny themselves and streamline their lifestyles except for the Obamas.Press reports make it evident the Obama entourage set aside substantial time for tourism. In London, Michelle Obama joined Prince Harry for afternoon tea at Kensington Palace.And the White House press office conceded that, while in Italy,  The First Lady will also visit cultural sites in Venice before returning to Washington, D.C. Judicial Watch released records revealing significant taxpayer-funded travel expenses for a Michelle Obama trip in July. Those records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force showed that Michelle Obama s 2014 trip to China cost American taxpayers $362,523.53 in travel expenses alone. Mrs. Obama, her daughters, and her mother spent March 19   26 in China, in a trip highlighted by extended visits to some of the country s most popular tourist sites.Apparently, the Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades. If Michelle Obama wants to take tea with Prince Harry or enthuse over Da Vinci s The Last Supper, she is certainly entitled to do so, but not at taxpayer expense.Since the beginning of Barack Obama s administration, the Obamas have become increasingly notorious for unnecessary, luxurious travel, under the guise of official business.NewsmaxPresident Obama admitted he cried at a recent senior staff send-off dinner   and is now claiming that he d be able to get re-elected if he had run for president again. I am confident in this vision because I m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,  Obama said in a  The Axe Files  podcast interview by former aide David Axelrod. I know that in conversations that I ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say,  The vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,  the outgoing president said.The Constitution limits a president to serving only two terms.Reflecting on his presidency, Obama said he s been inspired by the  heart  and  idealism  of his staff. We had our senior staff dinner   I got through about four minutes of the thing and started getting the hanky out,  he admitted.Obama said it feels like the  band  is breaking up, but that he wants to devote his post-presidency to growing the  talent  and vision that began in his two terms as president of the United States. Overall, this place never got cynical,  he said, praising the many aides he s had over the years. We never had that fire snuffed out. That is a point of pride for me,  he added.The podcast interview at times got personal, with Obama discussing his upbringing and talking about how his mom was a  hippie. But she always insisted on shaving her legs,  he told his former aide.The president also looked forward to leaving the White House, saying he s going to take his wife, Michelle, on a  nice  vacation because  she deserves it.

"REPORT: ANTI-TRUMP, Open-Borders Clooney’s No Longer Feel Secure In England…Moving Back To U.S","Actor and immigration activist George Clooney will move to Los Angeles with his wife Amal and newborn twins Ella and Alexander due to security concerns at his England estate, according to a report.Life & Style magazine reported last week that the 56-year-old Oscar-winner will move his newly-expanded family to his mansion in Studio City, California, after deeming his 17th century mansion in Sonning, England to be not sufficiently safe for them. As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement,  an unnamed Clooney  insider  told the magazine.  His mansion in Studio City [Calif.] was deemed the most secure, and it s within minutes of an LAPD station. He doesn t feel like Amal and the twins are safe living in the English countryside,  the source told Life & Style.  He s determined to move his family to LA, where he feels much more secure. The report comes as England has been rocked by terrorist attacks in recent months, including the terrorist bombing of a concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in June that claimed the lives of 22 people, many of them young children.In May, British government officials disclosed that 23,000 known jihadi terrorists are believed to be residing in Britain, far more than the 3,000 that had initially been reported.The move for the Clooneys comes as both George and Amal have been among the most vocal and active celebrity advocates for open borders and the free flow of refugees between countries.In February of last year, the actor met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and praised the German leader s acceptance of refugees from Syria and other countries. The same month, Clooney told Sky News in an interview that the United States is not doing  enough  to help Syrian refugees, and that 10,000 refugees per year was too low a figure to be admitting into the country.In an April 2016 interview with the BBC, Amal Clooney criticized then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s plans to build a security wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, telling the outlet that the plan does not represent  U.S. values. George has also been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling The Guardian in a March 2016 interview that he believes Trump to be a  xenophobic fascist  and an  opportunist.  He previously described Trump s immigration policy proposals as  idiotic  and  intolerant.   Breitbart In July, 2016, it was reported that the Clooney s were considering moving from their mansion in Italy after a massive makeshift refugee camp was established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

OUTRAGE! OBAMA’S FEDERAL Wildlife Officers (?) ARREST Journalists For Videotaping Open Borders [VIDEO],"US Border Agents and local law enforcement gave these journalists permission to be there. But Obama s Federal Wildlife Officers had different plans for journalists, who attempted to expose the danger Obama s radical open-border policies pose to America s national security Federal Wildlife Officers? Infowars reporters were detained and disarmed by federal agents Wednesday while reporting near the Texas-Mexico border. Following the encounter, Infowars Joe Biggs explained how he and Michael Zimmermann were disarmed after the pair were taken into custody alongside fellow reporter Alejandra. We just got out of federal custody  we ve been there for 2 hours,  Biggs said.Despite previously getting approval from both border patrol and law enforcement to be in the area, federal wildlife officers   known to be Obama s attack dogs on the border   ordered the crew to put their hands up after encountering them filming a report.After being questioned for hours, Biggs and Zimmermann were told by federal officers that they would need to pay $230 each in order to receive their firearms back. The trio were also charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and threatened with felony charges if they returned to the area.Despite being told that the area was off-limits to the public, investigation into the location reveals the exact opposite to be true.Only hours earlier an entirely separate law enforcement group told the reporters that they would have to leave a different part of the border as well.

 This Woman And Her Sign Show Us Everything You Need To Know About Trump’s Black Support (IMAGE),"Donald Trump, while pretending to reach out to minorities, has almost no minority support. That doesn t stop him from talking down to African-Americans and telling them that they live in conditions of dangerous squalor that only he can fix. Of course, that doesn t stop Trump from bragging about his  great relationship with the blacks.

 Obama Shows Why Trump Is Too Much Of A Hothead To Be President,"Donald Trump has constantly involved himself in one silly feud after another, going ballistic on a series of individuals and institutions in a childish tantrum style, often about topics that have absolutely nothing to do with being elected president.Trump has done this so often, Hillary Clinton referenced the behavior in her speech accepting the Democratic nomination in Philadelphia this summer, noting,  Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. The current occupant of the White House, President Obama, recently showed off the stark difference in temperament between himself and someone like Trump in how he responded to poor treatment by Chinese authorities.The Chinese prevented a set of stairs from being used to allow Obama to walk off of Air Force One, forcing the White House to eventually scrap the process even though it is a key element in the imagery of the President arriving for a diplomatic event like the G20. Obama could have chosen to complain and whine and moan about it. Instead Mr. Obama played down the incident, saying it was part of the normal give-and-take over security and media access that the United States has with many foreign countries.He noted that foreign delegations often feel bruised by their treatment when they visit the United States. And he acknowledged that the White House places a lot of demands on countries he visits because of the size of his entourage and his security demands.Can you imagine Donald Trump letting a violation of protocol or   more importantly in his egocentric eyes   allowing an opportunity for a photo-op to pass him by? No doubt a raft of Chinese officials, including the stair operator, would be subject to aggressive Trump tweets. He might even come up with one of his childish nicknames.Instead, Obama let it slide, going on to sign a major agreement with the Chinese president in order to fight global climate change   a real problem, not an optics one.That s a big difference.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 5, 2016"
 Watch How Obama Shoots Down Trump’s ‘Rigged’ Election Conspiracy (VIDEO),"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reacted to a series of state and national polls showing him losing ground to Hillary Clinton by promoting the conspiracy theory that this fall s presidential election will be  rigged. At a press conference at the Pentagon on Thursday, President Obama was asked about the baseless claim, and the President reacted with derision and scorn, apparently disgusted that the idea was even being floated. Of course the election will not be rigged! What does that mean?  Obama said at a news conference at the Pentagon.  That s ridiculous. That doesn t make any sense. The president added Americans should not take Trump s musings on this seriously.  We do take seriously, as we always do,  the president said,  our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process. Obama went on to point out that the move by Trump smells of desperation. The President pointed out that a complaint like Trump s is usually made on a schoolyard by children, not someone in the middle of an interview for the most important leadership position in the world. Obama said that those kinds of comments are like a kid complaining about a loss  before the score is even tallied. Trump seems to have gotten the idea from his close ally Roger Stone, the Republican dirty trickster who helped to organize the  Brooks Brothers riot  during the 2000 recount in Florida. Stone and 9/11 conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, a Trump supporter, have promoted the bizarre idea for some time now.The freak-out has come as polls taken after the successful Democratic Convention have shown a major swing in Hillary Clinton s favor. Marist shows Clinton with a 15 percent edge on Trump nationally, while NBC s poll shows her up nine percent. State polls taken in so-called  rust belt  states key to a Trump victory show Clinton ahead in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Other polls also showed her in the lead in Florida and New Hampshire. Without those states, it is unlikely that Trump would have a path to victory.Featured image via Twitter",News,"August 4, 2016"

The bartender announces that the bar is closing, but Bernie refuses to leave announcing that he ll leave when he s good and ready to leave. It s at this point that Hillary and Bernie have one last drink at the bar   Bernie a drink that that s  refreshing and revolutionary  that  draws huge crowds,  while Hillary had a beer  no one likes, but gets the job done. The pair then rehashes over the campaign and what they might have done differently, and while Bernie admits that he secretly imagines being a millionaire and eating fancy foods, Hillary  admits  that she  really really  wants to be president. Something Bernie is keenly aware of.Hillary then invites Bernie to dance where, of course, she insists on leading, and the two dance off throughout the SNL studio.It s going to be a long summer without the SNL cast going after the candidates from both sides at every turn, but one thing is for certain, the season premiere this fall is bound to be pretty damn epic.Watch the cold open here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 22, 2016"

RUSH LIMBAUGH ASKS: “What Would America Be Like Today If President Obama Had Told the Truth About What Happened in Ferguson?”,"Rush Limbaugh is spot on with his analysis of Barack Obama and how he has intentionally torn our nation apart, and more importantly, how Republican leadership has allowed him to do it. This is a great read for anyone who would like to understand exactly how this war on cops and war on White America started RUSH: This is so predictable to me. You know, I didn t have a chance to really listen to it or study Obama s speech in Dallas yesterday because it happened while the program was on, so I had to bone up on it later in the day. And it was predictable. The reaction to it was predictable. The Drive-Bys just thought it was the greatest speech ever. It was just over the top great. I mean, it was so timely, and it was so presidential.Even some in the conservative media found it necessary to praise Obama s speech. And we know why this happens. It is because some in the conservative media don t want to be seen as constantly pestering the guy, so it s thought that it ll add to their credibility if they can acknowledge that the president did something well, did something good, presidential, even if it was only a portion of the speech.But my take on it was entirely different. I think the first half of his speech yesterday seemed to be high-minded and unifying, but he blows it all to smithereens because I think what the first half of the speech was was a setup for the political hackery that was to come. It wasn t as if the speech suddenly and unexpectedly veered off course. Obama knew that he had to give the impression he was a healer and a unifier before he could pivot to what he really wanted to say.And I took it, you know, I m sitting there watching it like everybody else did, and I m absorbing it, and I felt like it was a political sucker punch. The second half of the speech is what Obama really wanted to say but couldn t unless he preceded it with the so-called unifying remarks beforehand.But here s the thing I was wondering as I m watching Obama, and we hear people on the left in the Drive-By Media talking about how Obama tries to unify and bring everybody together.  What a great effort! Ah, it was just stupendous. Then why draw a moral equivalence? Here he was at a memorial service for five slain Dallas police officers. Why draw any kind of a more ? Why do you mention Alton Sterling and what went on in Minnesota? Why? You can mention it, but this effort to draw some kind of moral equivalence as though there is one and we can understand all of it happening? This inability to look at something and proclaim it wrong  (interruption)Well, yeah, okay. So he knew he d get grief from the left. I don t think he cares he get grief from the left. I think the guy s got his agenda and he s full-speed marching it down the path. I m just  When this year began, I warned everybody. I said,  Folks, this year coming up with the Republicans having given Obama a clear road signaling they re not gonna oppose anything, not even his policies  You know, Mitch McConnell and Ryan announced they weren t gonna oppose Obama.They didn t want to appear to be opposing or creating any negatives for the Republican presidential nominee. So Obama knows he s got a free road. So why does he care that the left might come at him and say he wasn t left-wing enough or he wasn t pro-Black Lives Matter enough? I don t think there s any doubt where Obama stands with people on the left. I want you to stop and think about something. I want to set it up by acknowledging something that we all know. Obama knows it; everybody knows it.The entire narrative of Ferguson, Missouri, is a lie.  Hands up, don t shoot  is a lie. The story that a racist cop went hunting and found an innocent Gentle Giant walking down the street   when he should have been on the sidewalk   contemplating excitedly  This is part of the story: He was eagerly anticipating his freshman year at college, was Michael Brown, and this racist cop went hunting, and he found a guy breaking the law, walking in the street!And he got up in his face and he all bullied him and so forth, and Brown was immediately deferential and put his hands up and said,  Don t shoot! Don t shoot!  and the cop shot anyway. That is the story that came out of there, and that story fed entire narrative of Black Lives Matter and whatever they re trying to do to create controversy and division. And it fed the New Black Panthers. It was a lie. It was a total lie.Everything about that Ferguson story as repeated by the media and prominent Democrats and civil rights activists was a lie. What if ? I want you to think about it. What if, in the aftermath of Ferguson, Missouri, Barack Obama, as president of the United States   meaning president of the whole country, meaning president of everybody here   had scheduled a national address from the Oval Office, an address to the people of America and told them the truth about what happened in Ferguson?After the grand jury investigation was complete, after it was inarguably so   after we learned exactly what happened, that the Gentle Giant had robbed a convenience store, that he was looking for a mechanism to spoke some dope. He had bullied the clerk in the 7-Eleven, the convenience store, whatever. He was walking down the street. He had attempted to overtake the cop in his car. He had defied the requests and the orders of the cop. He had taken action which resulted in the cop shooting.Everything about that story was not true.What if Obama had gone on TV and simply told people? For the sake of national unity, for the sake of understanding, for the sake of promoting and acknowledged truth, what if Obama had been on TV and acknowledged what really happened and had told everybody that what they think happened in Ferguson didn t happen? What do you think the aftermath might have been?This is what we expect of presidents, is the point. We don t expect presidents to further and promulgate lies and misinformation for the express purpose of creating and fomenting deadly anger. Presidents try to quell these situations. They try to get a handle on  em and ratchet down the tension. Such an opportunity exists here because the truth was the truth, and the truth was not part of the narrative. Now, if that had happened   and I can t predict in the alternative future, but I have to think that the aftermath of that incident the lie would have been short-lived.And the anger would have subdued. Maybe it would have been redirected toward Obama; I don t know. But, remember: It fed Baltimore, it fed Freddie Gray, it fed the situation in New York with the Eric Garner   who also died of a heart attack, not a chokehold. That s another lie that was told. This guy was selling knock-off cigarettes on the street of New York. He s telling  Because New York City taxes it so high that the guy could make a living selling black market cigarettes, selling black market cigarettes.For some reason, he came to the attention of the cop. They ended up applying a restraining hold on the guy, but he had a heart attack. It was not  The chokehold didn t kill. The cops did not kill the guy. But that s not the story. There are so many lies that have been created and then, if not promoted, they have not been quelled by the White House, which makes me question motive. Why not? Of course, I know the answer to this, and you do, too.You know the answer lies in the president s agenda and is rapidly becoming the Democrat Party agenda. I was looking at the Democrat Party platform. You wouldn t believe, folks. The Democrat Party has been totally now taken over by the radicals. I mean, just insane lunatic radicals are now the mainstream of the Democrat Party. You look at the Democrat Party platform in  08 and look at it in 2012. They acknowledge the legitimacy of the Second Amendment, these platforms.Platforms don t matter much in terms of future governing. I mean, they re not binding on presidents if they win the election to implement the platform, whatever. What the platform basically does is tell you what the base of the party thinks about things,  cause the base of the party dominates in primaries and they end up on the committee that writes the platform, so the platform gives you an indication where the base of both parties are. The Democrat Party is Not only is it not John F. Kennedy s Democrat Party. It isn t Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton s Democrat Party. Hillary Clinton is a  Well, I don t want to  She s a radical in and of her own right, but she tempers her radicalness with enough proclamations or statements that make her to be mainstream in enough areas. But there isn t any mainstream anything in the Democrat Party platform. And I m telling you: It s what happens when there s no opposition.When there s no opposition, when there no guardrails, when there s nothing to stop people from descending to their extreme worst, that s exactly what s gonna happen. And I m here to tell you: The extremism in America could be found almost exclusively on the Democrat side, and that extremism has been documented in their platform, and it was speaking in Dallas yesterday. This idea of finding a moral equivalence, and taking the occasion of a memorial service at a funeral for one of the cops to say it?It was a funeral for one of the cops yesterday. To take the occasion and use it to amplify ? That statement,  It s easier to get a Glock than to get a computer or gun?  Come on! What in the world can that possibly represent, that kind of statement? There s nothing unifying about that. It s not even true. And he knows it isn t true. So that s nothing but a provocative statement designed to illustrate an actual opinion held by Barack Obama, and he turned that whole thing yesterday into yet another attempt at gun control.I think it s the  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, there s a chapter. If you haven t heard this, buckle up. It s a chapter of the NAALCP, the National Association for the Advancement of Liberal Colored People.

" Trump Has CRAZY Meltdown On ‘Face The Nation’, Ends Interview In The Most COWARDLY Way (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his team are not only some of the most corrupt people we ve ever had infiltrate our government, but they re also some of the most cowardly   and Trump has just set an example to his team that will likely give way to even more spineless behavior.In an interview with CBS s Face The Nation, Trump actually cut the interview short, ending it abruptly by literally fleeing from reporter John Dickerson when Dickerson dared to question Trump about his unfounded claims that former POTUS Barack Obama wiretapped him (Trump has STILL not been able to prove this).Dickerson was speaking to Trump inside the Oval Office when the discussion turned to Trump s relationship with Obama, and Trump made some extremely disrespectful, inflammatory remarks. Trump said he d  had some difficulties  with Obama over  what happened with surveillance.  When Dickerson cornered Trump on why he d called his predecessor  sick  and  bad  in his wiretapping accusations in March, Trump practically had a breakdown from being put on the spot while the cameras rolled. Trump gave this incoherent response: I don t stand by anything. I just, you can take it the way you want. I think our side s been proven very strongly. And everybody s talking about it. And frankly it should be discussed. I think that is a very big surveillance of our citizens. I think it s a very big topic. And it s a topic that should be number one. And we should find out what the hell is going on. Trump only seemed to get more frustrated and edgy as Dickerson tried to get to the bottom of Trump s babbling. Trump said: You don t have to ask me.Because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions. Dickerson had tried to hold Trump accountable, and it was just too much for the man baby. Trump suddenly ended the interview by straight up walking AWAY from Dickerson, saying  Okay, that s enough, thank you, thank you very much.

 How Democrats Are Making History With Ads CRUSHING Trump,"For months, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has claimed that his innovative use of social media and his vast personal fortune will allow him to dominate Hillary Clinton and the Democrats in the fall. But in reality, as the key fight in the battleground states that will likely determine the next president begins, Trump is getting destroyed by Secretary Clinton s campaign and allies.Democrats have $23 million worth of advertising on the air; Trump has NONE.Every single 2016 presidential TV ad currently airing in a battleground state is either from Hillary Clinton s campaign or the Democratic outside groups supporting her.The opposition, by contrast, hasn t spent a dime in these same battlegrounds   whether it s Donald Trump s campaign or Republican-leaning Super PACs.So far in June, Clinton and the outside groups backing her have spent a total of $23.3 million on ads in the battleground states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, according to ad-spending data from SMG Delta.By comparison in 2012, the advertising in battleground states at this point was 54%-46% in favor of President Obama against Mitt Romney. Even with that single digit edge, Obama went on to win every battleground state and secured a landslide in the electoral college for his second term.Despite having the same amount of time to plan for the election and a primary that wrapped up about a month before the Democrats were done, Republicans have still lagged behind. They don t have as many campaign staff on the ground in key swing states, as Trump often didn t set up staff there and has dismantled much of what he had.Trump has also had issues with raising money, as reports indicate he has been too lazy to make the critical calls to the financiers that finance party activities and advertising. Despite his claim to be a  billionaire,  there has been little sign that Trump is actually willing to put his own money where his mouth is and finance his presidential campaign.Behind the scenes reporting has shown Republican insiders worried about their inability to compete this fall, while major Republican donors like the Koch Brothers are reluctant about donating to a campaign that could lose in a major landslide.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 19, 2016"
COPS ASK MAYOR TO REMOVE “Black Lives Matter” Banner Hanging At City Hall…His Response Is ASTOUNDING!,"Imagine what it must feel like for these officers who put on their uniforms and go to work, risking their lives in a city whose Mayor has arrogantly displayed an in-your-face banner supporting a cop-hating movement over the front entrance of the City Hall Somerville police officers are asking that the city s mayor remove a banner supporting the  Black Lives Matter  movement from City Hall and replace it with one proclaiming  All Lives Matter. In a Tuesday letter addressed to Mayor Joseph Curtatone, the Somerville Police Employee s Association, the bargaining unit for 90-95 patrol officers, called the city s support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the display of the banner  deeply  troubling. It is as inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our City would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country,  the association wrote.Citing what they saw as  fringe elements  of the movement, officers in the association argued that the activists have at times provoked violence against police around the nation, including the recent shooting in Dallas that killed five officers. The point is that these incidents have incited more than protests; they have incited some within the protest movement to use violence against police officers who had nothing to do with the shootings of black men, and have done so before all of the facts of each case were known,  the letter said.While the association acknowledged that black lives, as well as those of other minorities, matter just as much as white lives, it argued that Somerville s open support for the movement could imply that the department thinks otherwise. At the same time, we strongly object to a public banner sponsored by the City that [implicitly] paints police officers as the killers of innocent citizens of color when there is no evidence whatsoever that the police officers in the City are in anyway using their police power in a discriminatory of unlawful way,  the letter said.Instead, the officers asked that the banner be replaced with one that reads  All Lives Matter,  a move they believe would have the mayor standing in solidarity with the police department. The vast majority of police officers across this country are tasked with shielding, protecting, and assisting elements of the protest movement that loath them, spit on them, intentionally injure them and wish death upon them,  the association wrote.  Nonetheless, it is generally true that officers perform these very tasks with professionalism, honor, integrity, courage, and without hesitation. The letter didn t sway Curtatone, who said he doesn t plan to remove the banner. My unwavering support for our police officers does not and cannot preempt our commitment to addressing systemic racism in our nation,  Curtatone said in a statement to Boston.com.

"NANCY PELOSI, DEMOCRATS and ANTIFA Force Conservative Prayer Group To Cancel Event Because “a lot of innocent people were going to get hurt”","Joey Gibson of the group Patriot Prayer had planned to hold a peaceful rally with a diverse array of speakers, but ultimately opposition from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, other San Francisco Democrats and the Antifa movement proved too much. Mr. Gibson cancelled the Freedom Rally before it was scheduled to begin Saturday at Crissy Field in San Francisco, saying he feared it would erupt into a  huge riot  fueled by radical activists from antifa and By Any Means Necessary. It was the best thing to do for the city because the way it was set up is that a lot of innocent people were going to get hurt,  Mr. Gibson said during a press conference on Facebook Live.  That s a fact. A bunch of supporters, a bunch of antifa communists, normal liberals would have all been mixed together. It would have been a huge riot, and it would have been a disaster. A separate right-of-center event slated for Sunday in Berkeley called  No to Marxism in America  also was cancelled by organizers over fears of violence.San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee had urged residents instead to attend a rally at Civic Center Plaza, and thousands did, holding a  unite against hate  march while carrying anti-Trump signs and an enormous rainbow banner that said,  Rise and Resist! Ms. Pelosi had called on the National Park Service to reconsider Patriot Prayer s permit, describing the event as a  white supremacist rally. Reason has prevailed because the people of San Francisco have demonstrated our determination to protect the freedom of peaceful expression as well as public safety,  Ms. Pelosi said Saturday in a statement to the Mercury News.But Mr. Gibson accused San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Ms. Pelosi of stoking unrest by labeling the event as a white supremacy fest, even though most of the scheduled speakers were not white and Mr. Gibson himself is half-Asian. To call us white supremacists made San Francisco way more dangerous,  Mr. Gibson said.  Washington Times ",left-news,"Aug 27, 2017"
" Creationist Ken Ham Is Building A $101M Noah’s Ark In Kentucky, And He Wants You To Pay For It (VIDEO/TWEETS)","Australian-born Creationist Ken Ham and his fundamentalist Christian organization Answers in Genesis (AiG) are looking to build a $101m Ark Adventure in Kentucky, with the centerpiece of a reconstructed Ark. The problem is, they want you the taxpayer to pay for it.Ham, AiG and their so-called Young Earth Creationist movement believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible when it comes to the age and creation of the Earth and all life that ever inhabited it. They believe the Earth and all life was created in 6 days, by an omnipotent God, just 6,000 years ago. They believe dinosaurs and man inhabited the planet at the same time, because everything that is was created in those same 6 days. So yes, there will be a pair of dinosaurs on the ark.According to Newsweek, AiG purchased a 99-acre plot of land just outside Williamstown, Kentucky got the city for just a dollar five years ago. But since then, the project has hit one hurdle after another. Many of Ham s own making.The principal issue at stake now, is that Ham and AiG want the taxpayer to pick up the bill for around a quarter of the construction costs of the project in the form of tax rebates. The group sought to exploit subsidies provided by the state to boost tourism through the Tourism Development Incentive program. Projects of $1 million and upwards can recover 25% of project development costs by recouping their sales taxes.After much debate on their initial application, Kentucky approved the site for the scheme so long as AiG agreed to non-discriminatory hiring practices. This means, they could only recover the cash if they recruited people of all faiths and none. They could not specifically hire Creationists.A few bumps down the road later, and Ham and AiG had to significantly strip back their pans for the park. They were unable to gather together the funds and investment to create the full theme park. Due to the substantial changes to the plans, they had to resubmit their application to Kentucky for the tax rebate. This time is was denied. Why? Because apparently, honesty and integrity mean nothing to this group of creationists.Despite their reluctant agreements to get their hands on state cash, AiG had released a decidedly discriminatory recruitment policy for the Ark Adventure. The website demanded a salvation testimony  and a creationist statement of faith from all prospective job applicants   clearly ruling out non-believers.So now, Ken Ham and AiG are suing Kentucky for the money   claiming religious discrimination. Greg Lipper, senior litigation counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State points out the muddled-thinking that AiG is applying in this case. AiG is confusing what they have the right to do as a private organization with what taxpayers are required to fund, They re saying Kentucky taxpayers should pay for them to expand a religious ministry. That kind of argument would make Thomas Jefferson turn in his grave. No one is telling Ham as a private citizen, who or how he can hire. It is only as a recipient of state funds, which he is free to enter or not, that he is required to follow the stipulations that would be applied to any organization or individual doing the same. Just like chances of his theory of genesis being true, Ham s chances of getting his lawsuit through are slim to none.And his Ark hasn t escaped the attention of social media users either I just realised that America's immigration policy doesn't weed out Australian Ark Building Lunatics. #kenham  Gotapulse (@gotapulse) January 3, 2016If #KenHam could get a 500 yr old dude & his kids to build the Ark themselves w/o modern technology I would give the park more credit.  Uncle John (@azmoderate) January 18, 2016If Ken Ham wants to replicate the trials and tribulations of biblical Noah, then he should probably cease seeking to exploit tax loopholes to make up for his lack of fundraising skills. Religious freedom requires that if a man wants to spend $101 million of his own money to build a giant ark in Kentucky   he is free to do so. However, he has no right under religious freedom to expect you and I to pay for him to do so.Featured Image via YouTube Screengrab",News,"January 18, 2016"
WHOA! IS GEORGE SOROS Secretly Funding Jill Stein’s [Hillary’s] Recount Effort To Steal The Presidency From Trump?,"A post on Reddit citing an investigative journalist reads as follows:  RED ALERT! JIM STONE DISCOVERS SOROS BOT FUNDING JILL STEIN S RECOUNT CAMPAIGN AT RATE OF $160,000/HOUR!!!! DO NOT FALL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL, BIG TIME F*CKERY IS AFOOT!!! According to the post a donations to Jill Stein s election recount campaign are being made at a steady rate of $160,000 on the hour every hour of the day.The constant rate of donation, 24 hours a day, suggest that a computer program is being used to post the donations as opposed to real people making grassroots donation.However, the donations are being reported as grassroots donations from a myriad of online supporters to help her verify the integrity of the election.However, if real individuals are in fact making the actual donations they rate of the donations should drop over night when internet traffic is low.The rate should then steadily pick up during the course of the day up and then culminate during the  internet rush hour  when usage peaks, which is usually between 7 and 11 PM.For example the BBC,  the UK s equivalent of CNN, reports hourly average internet usage usage is as follows:If Jill Stein s recount campaign was real and donations are in fact coming in from real grass roots supporters then donations to the campaign should reflect this curve in some manner.However, they do not follow the curve of typical internet..Instead they are coming in at a constant hourly rate of $160,000 per hour every hour on the hour.To illustrate, HNN has compile this graph of Stein s donations per hour superimposed on the BBC s graph of internet usage per hour by device.The graph illustrates Jill Stein s recount donations in orange with a red outline which plots recount donations coming in at a constant rate of 4.16% per hour.It is impossible for Jill Stein s recount campaign to be receiving the same amount of donations from real online users every hour on the hour when real internet usage among devices varies widely hour to hour, specifically it peaks in the evening and becomes virtually non-existent between 1 am and 6 am in the morning.This clearly indicates the donations to the recount campaign are not from  grassroots internet users  but instead are the result of a computer programmed bot which is working behind the scenes to fund the campaign.It is almost as perplexing that Jill Stein s managed to raise in less than 24 hours more money than she has raised throughout her entire campaign but that is another story. Namely, Hillary Clinton is having Jill dirty her hands to demand a recount so Hillary is not implicated in not accepting the results of the election.It is still uncertain there is even a prima facie case for Stein to even demand a recount given she failed to capture more than 2% of the vote in any state. If Republicans stand their ground on this argument, Hillary will have to step out from behind her proxy and get her own hands hands dirty to force a recount to happen.Via Reddit:",politics,"Nov 26, 2016"
"STAND UP AND CHEER! UKIP Party Leader SLAMS Germany, France And EU Invasion Of Phony Refugees [VIDEO]","He s been Europe s version of the outspoken Ted Cruz for some time now. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party may be the most disliked member of the European Parliment. But he plows ahead, ignorning  the open sneers and insults by his fellow members of the EU Parliment.  In what must count as perhaps the worst piece of public policy seen in modern Europe for half a century. When you compound it with an already failing and flawed EU common asylum policy, by saying to the whole world,  Please come to Europe.  and we saw frankly, virtually a stampede, and we learned that 80% of those that are coming are not Syrian refugees. In fact, what you ve done is opened the door to young, male, economic migrants, many of whom I have to say behave quite in a rather an aggressive manner, quite the opposite of what you would expect to see of any refugee. And yet when that failure is met by objections from countries like Hungary, their opinions are crushed.  This isn t a Europe of peace, it s a Europe of division, it s a Europe of disharmony, it s a Europe that s a recipe for resentment. And yet, faced with all this failure, both of you said the same thing today. You said,  Europe isn t working so let s have some more Europe, more of the same failing.  Well there is I think, a bright star on the horizon. It s called the British referendum.

 Mexico Just RUINED Donald Trump’s Plans In The Best Way Possible,"Trump likes trying to bully Mexico, even claiming that he will force them to pay for his stupid wall by making the  rapists  and  drug dealers  down there pay a 20 percent tax on goods exported to the United States. Mexico has been very clear that there is no interest in engaging in Donald Trump s ridiculous plan   but the government recently sent Trump a very clear message about what he (and America) has to lose if he persists with this madness. The Globe and Mail reports that a Mexican cabinet minister has revealed Mexico s plan to stop The Donald. If you tax that $50bn [trade defecit] at 20 percent of imports   which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do   right now our country s policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous. By doing it that way we can do $10bn a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That s really going to provide the funding,  Trump s mouthpiece Sean Spicer said in January while explaining how the wall would be funded. There is so much at stake for the interest of the U.S. as a country,  Mexico s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an interview, adding that the country could stop cooperating on security and intelligence, migration control, and drug enforcement: We have been a great ally to fight problems with migration, narcotics   If at some point in time things become so badly managed in the relationship, the incentives for the Mexican people to keep on co-operating in things that are at the heart of [U.S.] national-security issues will be diminished.You cannot ask me to [accept poor] conditions in terms of trade and then request my help to manage migration issues from other nations or   the prosecution of criminal activities and narcotics. Right now there are many more Mexicans coming back than there are leaving and the great challenge is the flows of every other nationality coming through Mexico,  Guajardo says, noting that Mexico detained 330,000 Central Americans in the last two years alone and would likely be very willing to stop helping in that regard if a certain orange someone gave them a reason. The Globe notes that the program  has been criticized by Mexican human rights organizations because it has little or no security benefit for Mexico, and contravenes obligations Mexico has as a signatory to international convention on the rights of migrants and refugees. Simply put, Guajardo seems to be perfectly happy to  allow the migrants to proceed north on the train and bus routes they used to take unhindered to the northern border.  In addiction, Mexico could stop allowing our agents to screen migrants, which would damage our national security. So there are many things at stake that cannot be undervalued or undermined,  Mr. Guajardo said. And that s why my President, with the principles that he gave us for these bilateral dealings, he was very clear in saying that this negotiation has to be figured out with all items considered.  He adds that Trump s rhetoric  can have a damaging consequence  and  it will be very foolish to continue. Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab",News,"February 20, 2017"
 Marco Rubio Comes Out Of Mothballs To Issue Dumbest Statement On Trump Yet,"Marco Rubio, who is now working doggedly to keep his mostly-empty Senate seat, actually has something new to say about Donald Trump. He s drunk the Kool-Aid, but it must have been an especially strong cup of it, because his statement actually makes Trump and the RNC look worse than ever, if that s possible.Trump must learn about an awful lot if he s going to be president   considerably more than most other presidential candidates in our history. Rubio said: As he settles into this role as the nominee and ultimately the president, access to these issues is going to begin to, in some ways, kind of shape some of the policy positions given reality versus perhaps what you might read about on a blog somewhere. Har de har har don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts. And on top of that, the stupid here just burns. Sure, nobody s born knowing how to be President, and all of them have things to learn as they go along. Trump, though, has shown zero interest in learning anything at all and Rubio knows that. This is the man who said, at a presser just this morning, that he s never had a second thought. This is the man who said his best foreign policy adviser is himself. This is the man that emailed foreign governments for campaign donations.This is the man who called on Russia to help him win this election: Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Despite all that, here s Rubio, now saying that Donald Trump will learn once he s elected. He s completely forgotten that Trump gets a lot of his news from sites like The Drudge Report and Alex Jones  InfoWars. Just how strong was that Kool-Aid, anyway? It s a wonder Rubio doesn t suffer some kind of poisoning from it. Trump will never accept sane advisers, because sane advisers won t tell him what he wants to hear.Rubio is in a close race in Florida. The #NeverTrump crowd could decide to sit out the vote over this, or vote for Democrat Patrick Murphy. Considering that Trump might be  a moment of reckoning  for Republican candidates and the party as a whole, defending Trump by saying it s perfectly okay if he learns once he s elected, when he s proven time and again that he s certain he already knows everything imaginable, is pretty stupid.

 Trump Influence CRUMBLING As His Own Supporters Share SHOCKING Resentment For Him (DETAILS),"The majority of America saw this coming: Trump s supporters are finally becoming extremely disappointed in the failing performance of their president of choice.Thanks to a New York Times profile of Trump supporters in Pennsylvania, we now know that Trump voters recognize that they re not seeing any of the  winning  that Trump has promised them over and over. Things have gotten so bad, that the only people in Trump s corner are actually losing hope.Theresa Remington, a home-care worker with two children on active duty in the Marines, had hopes Trump would be good for the Veterans Administration and health care system   and has been severely disappointed. Remington said Trump was Just like any other damn president,  and now she s curious about what things would have been like if Sen.

It s seeing a house on fire and saying,  That house isn t on fire.  It is very clearly on fire. According to The Times, Trump supporters feel they have been blindsided and are wondering where Trump s grandiose promises have gone. Some have been completely turned off by Trump s erratic tweeting. Some are so upset with Trump that they feel more confident that Vice President Mike Pence would be a more capable POTUS.Bill Yokobosky IV, a train engineer, admitted: It s not what he s done, it s what he s trying to do. He hasn t succeeded, really. He s fighting himself and he s fighting Washington. They re just trying to get settled in there.

"¡VIVA LA REVOLUTION! As Venezuela Collapses Under Socialist Rule, Dictator Maduro Endorses Fellow Socialist Bernie Sanders","The leader of the worst economy on the planet is endorsing fellow Socialist Bernie Sanders. Let that sink in Yes It s  A future you can believe in  if you re an abject idiot who doesn t have access to a single news source. VENEZUELA TODAY: The army has moved in, Coca-Cola has stopped production and inflation is expected to hit 500 per cent.Venezuela s economic crisis has ratcheted up a gear in the last week after President Nicholas Maduro deployed the army to strategic areas for two days of  war games  designed as a show of strength to a population increasingly pitted against him.The drastic escalation follows a major deterioration in the country s finances that have seen widespread shortages of food, basic goods and power cuts, fueled by years of economic mismanagement and corruption that have seen unemployment skyrocket to 17 per cent as the oil price has plummeted.University College London s leadership professor Marco Aponte-Moreno, who was born and raised in Caracas, told news.com.au the past few days had seen the stakes raised for both corrupt officials and those dying from lack of food and medicine in his home country. The stakes are very high [for the government] if they lose power,  he said, adding that many involved in illegal activities could be charged and taken to trial. The situation has become a matter of life and death for the government and also a matter of life and death for the people because people are dying because they don t have their medicines, the water they need. It s very sad to see the country like this, especially when you take into account that this is a country that has large natural resources. I have to admit it isn t a surprise. Corruption, shortages are things that are not new in Venezuela but they have never reached this level before. Via- News.comauVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has endorsed fellow socialist Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., for president, calling him  our revolutionary friend. In a televised address on Tuesday, Maduro criticized the U.S. election system, which he called  archaic,  for putting Sanders at a disadvantage. If the elections were free,  Maduro said,  Bernie Sanders would be president of the United States. Socialist Venezuela, which has been criticized for lack of transparency in elections, frequently denounces the U.S. government and accuses it of imperialism. The South American country is also prone to blaming its economic woes on Washington, and the two countries do not exchange ambassadors.Is this the America so many college students are dreaming of?Venezuela teeters on the brink of collapse, with low global oil prices contributing to massive shortage of basic goods like flour and toilet paper. The government recently moved to a two-day work week for public employees in an effort to conserve electricity.Maduro, who has publicly denounced President Barack Obama, said Sanders  ought to win in the United States.

AMERICA’S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS LOWER But Number Of Americans On Food Stamps Is Shocking,"THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS ON FOOD STAMPS IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH!  Obama crows that the official unemployment rate is much lower than it was a few years ago. Too bad the statistic is meaningless:Despite the unemployment rate being at an eight-year low (4.9 percent as of January 2016), the number of people on food stamps remains near an all-time high which was 47,636,000 in 2013.Why the disparity in the numbers? Well, the unemployment rate does not take into account people who are not in, or have dropped out of, the workforce altogether.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January of this year that approximately 94 million Americans are not participating in the workforce.But the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been hovering around 46 million participants since 2011. The current figure, as of February 2016, stands at 45.8 million Americans receiving food stamps.Bloomberg Business reported that the last time the unemployment rate was at five percent in April 2008, only 28 million Americans were on food stamps.Several reasons explain the high numbers. Governments have made it easier to sign up for the program. More than 85 percent of eligible food-stamp recipients took assistance in 2013, the most recent year of available data, compared to 70 percent in 2008. The higher sign-up rate among those qualified accounts for 8.6 million more people on food stamps   about half of the program s total increase. Well, at least President Obama put forth one program that has been easy to sign up for.We now have a country based on government dependence. Heritage Foundation research fellow Robert Rector said,  Clearly there s a group of people who are not in the labor force, and 10 years ago they would have been. Now they re relying on food stamps. When we have a government full of enablers telling people that they don t have to work to provide for themselves and their families, they create an atmosphere of dependence and reliance.As the Big Government ratchet is turned ever further to the left, and it is ever easier to spend other people s money instead of earning your own, this number is more likely to rise than decline.READ MORE: MOONBATTERY",Government News,"Mar 3, 2016"
" Republican VP Candidate Makes Trump Proud, Uses Racial Slur To Describe Undocumented Immigrants","Donald Trump is more than likely leaning toward picking retired Lt. General Michael Flynn as his vice-presidential running mate after this.During an interview on The Week with guest host Martha Raddatz, Flynn referred to undocumented immigrants as  illegals. Flynn is currently on Trump s shortlist of possible running mates so he made sure to match the Republican nominee s anti-immigration rhetoric.Raddatz asked Flynn if all undocumented immigrants should be rounded up and deported. Flynn not only replied by using what many consider to be a racial slur, by using it he suggested that Trump would round them all up and send them back across the border as he builds his massive and expensive wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. Let s talk about immigration,  Raddatz began.  Let me ask you immigration: should all undocumented immigrants be deported? So undocumented or illegal?  Flynn asked in some attempt for clarification. Undocumented, illegal  Raddatz replied.Then Flynn proceeded to lecture Raddatz. Are they here illegally? I mean, if they re here illegally, then it s illegal. I mean, again, back to my very first point, the rule of law in this country is probably the single biggest strategic advantage that we have, above and beyond all other countries in the world. And we cannot allow the rule of law to break down. Here s the video via YouTube. The anti-immigrant remarks begin at the 5:18 mark:While the act of crossing the border without permission is illegal, the people doing it are not. Actions are illegal, not people. But because they are inherently racist, conservatives prefer using this term to describe Hispanic people whom they do not want in America.That s why the correct term to use is  undocumented. Elsewhere in the interview, Flynn also accused Hillary Clinton of blaming all white people for the killing of innocent black people by police officersLt. General Michael Flynn served his country honorably during his many years of service, some of which were under President Obama, who appointed him as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012.He is also a registered Democrat, although he claims that today s Democratic Party isn t the same one he grew up with, which is weird considering Democrats are fighting for social justice, women s rights, and civil rights just as they have been doing since Flynn was a child in the 1960s, so it s a little bit of a head-scratcher as to why he would want to ruin his reputation by agreeing to be vetted as a potential running mate for a racist bigoted Republican candidate like Donald Trump.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"July 10, 2016"

If you want. any questions have to be directed to our public affairs department,  he said.Kamal says he spoke with an employee over the phone who said the hijabs raise safety concerns. If it was about safety, a woman couldn t just walk into any old bank in these United States of America wearing a headscarf and get served,  said Dawud Walid.Walid, from the Council of American Islamic Relations, says women can go to banks, get their driver s licenses, even their passports while wearing headscarves.CAIR is part of lawsuit against Advance America for denying service to Muslim Arab-American women. Nadia is not the first. This is really about ignorance it s really about fossilized policies and people being stubborn and not coming up to the modern time,  Walid said.  Advance America respects all religious beliefs and serves all customers with dignity and respect. For the safety of our customers and employees, we do have a security policy in place that requires anyone seeking entry in to our centers briefly remove any hoods, hats, sunglasses or other head coverings. It is an important security measure designed to ensure that anyone entering our centers can be easily identified. That policy was being enforced in this particular case. The safety and security of our customers and employees are our primary responsibilities and we take them seriously.

WHY DECISION To Cut Off Gas Deliveries To Trump Supporters By Gas Co Owner In Maine Will Probably Destroy His Business [AUDIO],"An owner of a propane dealership in Maine is refusing to deliver gas to anyone who voted for President-Elect Donald Trump.Michael Turner, owner of Turner LP Gas in Skowhegan, Maine, recorded a voicemail greeting that leaves little question as to his feelings for those in his community who supported Trump. Thank you for calling Turner LP Gas. If you voted for Donald Trump for president, I will no longer be delivering your gas   please find someone else,  the message states.Turner isn t the first person to refuse to do business with Trump voters   in late November, Mathew Blanchfield, CEO of an Albuquerque, New Mexico-based marketing firm, issued a statement saying he would no longer work with Trump supporters.But unlike Blanchfield, who lives in a county that voted solidly for Hillary Clinton, Turner lives in a county that overwhelmingly supported Trump. Trump won Somerset County, Maine   in which Skowhegan is located   57.73 percent to Hillary Clinton s 35 percent.In Skowhegan specifically, where Clinton performed better than Somerset County at large, Trump still received over 50 percent of the vote and had a 10-point lead on Clinton, according to rough figures published on Skowhegan s town website. Turner is apparently so distraught over Trump s win he is willing alienate more than half of his community and possibly sacrifice his livelihood.  Lifezette",politics,"Dec 18, 2016"
 GOP Poll Workers Accused Of Cheating Dem Voters On Super Tuesday (AUDIO),"Independent voter Chris Sullivan went to the polls in Princeton, Texas on Super Tuesday, intending to cast a ballot in the Democratic primary.Sullivan says that a poll worker at Princeton High School, located in Collin County, Texas, instructed him to select any voting machine, saying that it didn t matter if he was voting for a Republican or a Democrat.Once Sullivan had selected a machine, however, he says it locked his vote in for a Republican candidate.As a result of being locked into a republican ballot, Sullivan says he was unable to cast his vote in the primary election.Following the debacle, he took to voice his outrage at having his vote stolen by GOP cheats.Image credit: screen capture, Chris Sullivan on FacebookAddicting Info spoke to Sullivan on March 2.He clarified what happened further, saying, It wasn t that I was directed to the wrong line  I was specifically told by one of the people at the desk that it didn t matter what party I chose, I could vote for anyone. Sullivan also told us that the poll worker he spoke to was clearly not neutral. I was standing behind a couple and the woman (poll worker) asked if they were voting republican. When they said yes, she replied  good cause I already locked you in. It might be easier to dismiss what happened to Sullivan as an error, as opposed to deliberate cheating, had he not overheard the same worker giving very different instructions to the Republican couple.Sullivan also told us that he felt like  there was a strong push to vote Republican,  from the poll workers.While he s not sure if any other Collin County voters had a similar experience, Sullivan says that he has already contacted attorneys for the Bernie Sanders campaign to report what happened. He also plans to report his experience to the Texas Attorney General s office today.As reported here, Democratic voters in Georgia also may have had their votes stolen, thanks to Republican dirty tricks.Brianna Fleener was one of many Democratic voters who were issued Republican ballots in Lowndes County, GA. I show up, I fill out the paper and I give it to the man at the counter,  Fleener told ValdostaToday.  Next, I was given a card to insert into the machine, and when I pulled up the screen I realized I was given the wrong ballot. Fleener says that several other Democratic voters were also given Republican ballots. As I look around, I notice I m not the only one. Turns out that anyone voting Democrat received a Republican ballot. After making some phone calls, we were told we could fix it, but we were showing up in the system as voted when none of us had casted our ballots. Democrats may not have been the only ones cheated out of their votes by the GOP on Super Tuesday.Austin s KLBJ radio station was flooded with calls claiming that voting machines were flipping votes from Donald Trump to other GOP candidates.Listen to the vote flipping accusations, reported to KLBJ, via Raw Story on YouTube: Image credit: imagebuddy.com, photoshop",News,"March 2, 2016"
FLASHBACK: HILLARY Received $500K In Jewelry From King Of Barbaric Nation Who Brutally Oppresses Women,"Nothing to see here. No conflict of interest. All feminists please look the other way you didn t really see this Crooked Hillary really is a champion of women s rights just not Saudi women s rights. August 30, 2013   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was given a half-million bucks worth of diamond and ruby jewelry by Saudi Arabian King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz and received $58,000 worth of bling from Brunei.The lavish gifts were among a treasure trove of keepsakes bestowed upon U.S. leaders in 2012, the State Department disclosed Thursday.The Constitution prohibits U.S. government employees from keeping presents worth more than $350. But officials at the U.S. General Services Administration said the gifts were accepted to avoid awkward moments. Via: NY Daily News",politics,"Jun 22, 2016"
"OBAMA’S Mexico Gun-Running, Race-Baiting, Former Attorney General Hired By State Of CA To Help Fight Against Trump","Eric Holder was embroiled in some sort of controversy for most of the time he served as Obama s choice for Attorney General. He was the key figure in the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal with Mexico, and was also involved in the IRS scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations. Holder also was instrumental in fanning the flames of the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Florida. While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS)  to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman. Holder was also present in Ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos. California lawmakers already are preparing for a legal brawl with the Donald Trump administration   and they ve got President Obama s former top attorney in their corner.Top state Democratic lawmakers announced Wednesday that former Attorney General Eric Holder has been tapped as outside counsel to advise the Legislature on potential challenges with the Trump government. He will lead a team from the Covington & Burling law firm, where he s been working since leaving the Obama administration in 2015. With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead,  California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le n and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement.  This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great. They said Holder and his team will advise  in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made. The statement did not specify which policies they anticipate will cause friction, though California s numerous sanctuary cities are likely to face challenges from an administration that has threatened to pull their federal funding.   FOX NewsSets forth articles of impeachment stating that Holder: (1) engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him in that position by refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 12, 2011, in connection with a congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); (2) failed to enforce multiple laws, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; (3) failed his oath of office by refusing to prosecute individuals involved in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal of unauthorized disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors; and (4) testified under oath before Congress on May 15, 2013, that he was neither involved in nor had heard of a potential prosecution of the press but later confirmed to the House Judiciary Committee in a letter dated June 19, 2013, that he approved of a search warrant on journalist James Rosen. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, De Le n suggested Holder s team will work on issues like immigration, climate change, the environment and voting rights. The unorthodox arrangement assigns to Holder s team some duties that normally would be handled by the state s top law enforcement official, the California attorney general. Gov. Jerry Brown has nominated Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra for that job.Holder was one of Obama s longest-serving and most controversial Cabinet members.He had a contentious relationship with congressional Republicans, who in 2012 voted to hold him in contempt of Congress for not turning over documents on the Fast and Furious  gun-walking  scandal.

" Donald Trump’s Statement After Losing Wisconsin Is Insane, Even For Him","Donald Trump s entire image is based around the idea that he is a  winner,  and while that idea isn t supported by the reality of Trump s legacy of failed businesses and ventures, it is still jarring to see his reaction after he loses a battle.Republican voters in Wisconsin chose Ted Cruz over Trump in the primary on Wednesday night, and as he has in the past, Trump lost ugly.His campaign issued a bizarre, unhinged press release to the media after the results had been called in favor of Cruz:Donald J. Trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again. Lyin  Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin, many conservative talk radio show hosts, and the entire party apparatus behind him. Not only was he propelled by the anti-Trump Super PAC s spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against Mr. Trump, but he was coordinating with his own Super PAC s (which is illegal) who totally control him. Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet   he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump. We have total confidence that Mr. Trump will go on to win in New York, where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls, and beyond. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to Make America Great Again.Completely over the top, factually inaccurate, and failing to make sense: All hallmarks of the Trump campaign so far. It shows why Republican establishment bigwigs are arguing over strategies to take him down at the convention, as polls regularly show him losing in double digits to both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. A poll from Mason Dixon even showed Trump with only a single-digit lead over Clinton in blood red Mississippi.But as this release shows, Trump isn t going to let his campaign be snuffed out quietly. If he loses at all, it s going to be with a loud, primal scream, and the GOP s bigwigs are going to hear all about it.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 6, 2016"

 CNN Guests Get Into INSANE Fight Over Trump’s Black Outreach: ‘You’re Supporting A Bigot!’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has been raising a lot of eyebrows lately with his new and pathetic attempts to win over African American voters, despite the fact that he only has about 2 percent of the black vote as of right now. As usual, Trump s delivery has been nothing but problematic, because he s been giving his speeches to mostly-white crowds in mostly-white areas because he doesn t feel safe in urban neighborhoods. This sparked a conversation on CNN that erupted into a heated exchange of words between guests Charles Blow and Bruce LeVell.Don Lemon started the discussion by rolling a ridiculous clip of Trump claiming that he would be able to win 95 percent of the black vote after he serves four years in the White House. LeVell, who was representing the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, got into an argument with Blow so intense that Lemon could hardly contain it and the two men forced CNN to skip a commercial break.Many of the two guests  jabs at each other were delivered in low voices but things got extra heated when Blow, a New York Times columnist, accurately called Trump out for being a bigot and then accused LeVell for supporting bigotry. LeVell responded by trying to place blame on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign by saying that they had purposely portrayed Trump to look like a bigot. This was all too much for Blow to handle. He erupted and laid into LeVell: I m not part of the Clinton campaign. I m a black man in America and I know a bigot when I see a bigot and you are supporting a bigot and that makes you part of the bigotry that s Donald Trump. LeVell fired back,  I know someone who doesn t tell the truth on national TV when I see it, sir. Lemon eventually had to jump in and mediate, and was probably thankful that his guests hadn t been in the same studio for this discussion.

" Trump, GOP Facing CATACLYSMIC Disaster In Nevada, Early Vote Tallies Show","Early voting has concluded in Nevada, and tallies don t really favor Trump. In fact, he and other Republicans may have already lost the state, given that Democrats currently have a 73,000 vote lead just in Clark County. That s more than the margin by which President Obama won in 2012.Democrats have a 45,000 vote lead overall in the state, not including rural counties, and that could spell doom for the entire Republican ticket statewide since it gives Democrats a six-point lead going into Election Day. It s not just Trump s chances bottoming out, it could also be the Republicans  hopes to retain control of the Senate.In other words, there are currently 45,000 tiny blows killing the GOP s hopes for that state.Jon Ralston, Nevada s top political analyst, says that Trump needs a miracle to win at this point. So do Republicans   this could cost them Harry Reid s Senate seat, as well as the state s two House seats and the state legislature.Nearly half of the state voted early, including higher numbers of Democrats than Republicans, and that just compounds the GOP s woes there. If voter turnout approaches 80 percent total on Tuesday, then two-thirds of the vote is already in. The remaining votes would almost all have to go to Trump and the GOP for them to win anything there.Nevada s diversity is a big part of what s giving Trump problems   Latino voters kept the Cardenas market open until 10pm because they were turning out in such large numbers. In fact, in Clark County, Friday was the single largest early-voting day they ve seen.The funny thing is that Trump has been polling within just a few points of Hillary in Nevada, so this probably comes as a shock to Republicans. But Republicans were pretty sure of a Romney victory in 2012, and he lost badly. Their so-called  autopsy report  revealed significant problems that they totally ignored, and this is the result.Trump has almost no path to the White House without Nevada.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2016"
